Constraint streams are an Functional Programming form of incremental score calculation in plain Java 8+
that is fast, scalable and debuggable.

[[constraintStreamsIntroduction]]
== Introduction

Using Java 8's Streams API, we could implement an <<easyJavaScoreCalculation,easy score calculator>>
that uses a functional approach:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
List<Talk> talkList = schedule.getTalkList();
talkList.stream()
        .filter(talk -> talk.hasAnyUnavailableSpeaker())
        .forEach(talk -> penalize(talk.getDurationInMinutes()));
----

However, that scales poorly because it doesn't do an <<incrementalScoreCalculation,incremental calculation>>.
When the planning variable of a single `Talk` changes, to recalculate the score,
the normal Streams API has to execute the entire stream from scratch.
So it doesn't do <<incrementalScoreCalculation,deltas>>.
Nor does it support <<explainingTheScore,justifications>>.

The ConstraintStreams API does do <<incrementalScoreCalculation,deltas>> and support <<explainingTheScore,justifications>>.

*Constraints stream will be implemented soon.*
