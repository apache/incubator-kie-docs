  <title>Local search</title>

  <section>
    <title>Overview</title>

    <para>Local Search starts from an initial solution and evolves that single solution into a mostly better and better
    solution. It uses a single search path of solutions, not a search tree. At each solution in this path it evaluates a
    number of moves on the solution and applies the most suitable move to take the step to the next solution. It does
    that for a high number of iterations until it's terminated (usually because its time has run out).</para>

    <para>Local Search acts a lot like a human planner: it uses a single search path and moves facts around to find a
    good feasible solution. Therefore it's pretty natural to implement.</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Local Search usually needs to start from an initialized solution</emphasis>, therefore
    it's usually required to configure a construction heuristic solver phase before it.</para>

      <title>Taking steps</title>

      <para>A step is the winning <literal>Move</literal>. The local search solver tries every move on the current
      solution and picks the best accepted move as the step:</para>

        <title>Decide the next step at step 0 (4 queens example)</title>

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>Because the move <emphasis>B0 to B3</emphasis> has the highest score (<literal>-3</literal>), it is picked
      as the next step. If multiple moves have the same highest score, one is picked randomly, in this case <emphasis>B0
      to B3</emphasis>. Note that <emphasis>C0 to C3</emphasis> (not shown) could also have been picked because it also
      has the score <literal>-3</literal>.</para>

      <para>The step is applied on the solution. From that new solution, the local search solver tries every move again,
      to decide the next step after that. It continually does this in a loop, and we get something like this:</para>

      <figure>
        <title>All steps (4 queens example)</title>

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>Notice that the local search solver doesn't use a search tree, but a search path. The search path is
      highlighted by the green arrows. At each step it tries all possible moves, but unless it's the step, it doesn't
      investigate that solution further. This is one of the reasons why local search is very scalable.</para>

      <para>As you can see, Local Search solves the 4 queens problem by starting with the starting solution and make the
      following steps sequentially:</para>

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>B0 to B3</emphasis></para>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>A0 to B1</emphasis></para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <para>If we turn on <literal>debug</literal> logging for the category <literal>org.optaplanner</literal>, then
      those steps are shown into the log:</para>

      <programlisting>INFO  Solving started: time spent (0), best score (-6), random (JDK with seed 0).

      <para>Notice that the logging uses the <literal>toString()</literal> method of the <literal>Move</literal>
      implementation: <literal>col1@row0 =&gt; row3</literal>.</para>

      <para>A naive Local Search configuration solves the 4 queens problem in 3 steps, by evaluating only 37 possible
      solutions (3 steps with 12 moves each + 1 starting solution), which is only fraction of all 256 possible
      solutions. It solves 16 queens in 31 steps, by evaluating only 7441 out of 18446744073709551616 possible
      solutions. Note: with construction heuristics it's even a lot more efficient.</para>

      <title>Deciding the next step</title>

      <para>The local search solver decides the next step with the aid of 3 configurable components:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>A <literal>MoveSelector</literal> which selects the possible moves of the current solution. See the
          chapter <link linkend="moveAndNeighborhoodSelection">move and neighborhood selection</link>.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>An <literal>Acceptor</literal> which filters out unacceptable moves.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>A <literal>Forager</literal> which gathers accepted moves and picks the next step from them.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>The solver phase configuration looks like this:</para>

      <programlisting language="xml">  &lt;localSearch&gt;
    &lt;unionMoveSelector&gt;
      ...
    &lt;/unionMoveSelector&gt;
    &lt;acceptor&gt;
      ...
    &lt;/acceptor&gt;
    &lt;forager&gt;
      ...
    &lt;/forager&gt;
  &lt;/localSearch&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>In the example below, the <literal>MoveSelector</literal> generated the moves shown with the blue lines, the
      <literal>Acceptor</literal> accepted all of them and the <literal>Forager</literal> picked the move <emphasis>B0
      to B3</emphasis>.</para>

      </mediaobject>

      <para><link linkend="logging">Turn on <literal>trace</literal> logging</link> to show the decision making in the
      log:</para>

      <programlisting>INFO  Solver started: time spent (0), score (-6), new best score (-6), random (JDK with seed 0).
TRACE         Move index (0) not doable, ignoring move (col0@row0 =&gt; row0).

DEBUG     LS step (0), time spent (6), score (-3), new best score (-3), accepted/selected move count (12/12), picked move (col1@row0 =&gt; row3).
...</programlisting>

      <para>Because the last solution can degrade (for example in Tabu Search), the <literal>Solver</literal> remembers
      the best solution it has encountered through the entire search path. Each time the current solution is better than
      the last best solution, the current solution is cloned and referenced as the new best solution.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Acceptor</title>

      <para>An <literal>Acceptor</literal> is used (together with a <literal>Forager</literal>) to active Tabu Search,
      Simulated Annealing, Late Acceptance, ... For each move it checks whether it is accepted or not.</para>

      <para>By changing a few lines of configuration, you can easily switch from Tabu Search to Simulated Annealing or
      Late Acceptance and back.</para>

      <para>You can implement your own <literal>Acceptor</literal>, but the build-in acceptors should suffice for most
      needs. You can also combine multiple acceptors.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Forager</title>

      <para>A <literal>Forager</literal> gathers all accepted moves and picks the move which is the next step. Normally
      it picks the accepted move with the highest score. If several accepted moves have the highest score, one is picked
      randomly.</para>

      <para>You can implement your own <literal>Forager</literal>, but the build-in forager should suffice for most
      needs.</para>

      <section xml:id="acceptedCountLimit">
        <title>Accepted count limit</title>

        <para>When there are many possible moves, it becomes inefficient to evaluate all of them at every step. To
        evaluate only a random subset of all the moves, use:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>An <literal>acceptedCountLimit</literal> integer, which specifies how many accepted moves should be
            evaluated during each step. By default, all accepted moves are evaluated at every step.</para>

            <programlisting language="xml">  &lt;forager&gt;
    &lt;acceptedCountLimit&gt;1000&lt;/acceptedCountLimit&gt;
  &lt;/forager&gt;</programlisting>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>Unlike the n queens problem, real world problems require the use of <literal>acceptedCountLimit</literal>.
        Start from an <literal>acceptedCountLimit</literal> that takes a step in less then 2 seconds. <link
        linkend="logging">Turn on INFO logging</link> to see the step times. Use the <link
        linkend="benchmarkingAndTweaking">Benchmarker</link> to tweak the value.</para>

        <important>
          <para>With a low <literal>acceptedCountLimit</literal> it is recommended to avoid using
          <literal>selectionOrder</literal> SHUFFLED because the shuffling generates a random number for every element
          in the selector, taking up a lot of time, but only a few elements are actually selected.</para>

      </section>

      <section xml:id="pickEarlyType">
        <title>Pick early type</title>

        <para>A forager can pick a move early during a step, ignoring subsequent selected moves. There are 3 pick early

      <title>Algorithm description</title>

      <para>Hill Climbing tries all selected moves and then takes the best move, which is the move which leads to the
      solution with the highest score. That best move is called the step move. From that new solution, it again tries
      all selected moves and takes the best move and continues like that iteratively. If multiple selected moves tie for
      the best move, one of them is randomly chosen as the best move.</para>

      </mediaobject>

      <para>Notice that one a queen has moved, it can be moved again later. This is a good thing, because in an
      NP-complete problem it's impossible to predict what will be the optimal final value for a planning
      variable.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Getting stuck in local optima</title>

      <para>Hill Climbing always takes improving moves. This may seem like a good thing, but it's not: <emphasis
      role="bold">Hill Climbing can easily get stuck in a local optimum.</emphasis> This happens when it reaches a
      solution for which all the moves deteriorate the score. Even if it picks one of those moves, the next step might
      go back to the original solution and which case chasing it's own tail:</para>

      <para>Improvements upon Hill Climbing (such as Tabu Search, Simulated Annealing and Late Acceptance) address the
      problem of being stuck in local optima. Therefore, it's recommend to never use Hill Climbing, unless you're

      <para>Tabu Search works like Hill Climbing, but it maintains a tabu list to avoid getting stuck in local optima.
      The tabu list holds recently used objects that are <emphasis>taboo</emphasis> to use for now. Moves that involve
      an object in the tabu list, are not accepted. The tabu list objects can be anything related to the move, such as
      the planning entity, planning value, move, solution, ... Here's an example with entity tabu for 4 queens, so the
      queens are put in the tabu list:</para>

      <para>When Tabu Search takes steps it creates one or more tabu's. For a number of steps, it does not accept a move

      <para>OptaPlanner implements several tabu types:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Planning entity tabu</emphasis> makes the planning entities of recent steps tabu. For example,

    &lt;/acceptor&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>To avoid hard coding the tabu size, configure a tabu ratio, relative to the number of entities, for

      <para>If you pick a too small tabu size, your solver can still get stuck in a local optimum. On the other hand,
      with the exception of solution tabu, if you pick a too large tabu size, your solver can get stuck by bouncing of

      <title>Algorithm description</title>

      <para>Simulated Annealing evaluates only a few moves per step, so it steps quickly. In the classic implementation,
      the first accepted move is the winning step. A move is accepted if it doesn't decrease the score or - in case it
      does decrease the score - if passes a random check. The chance that a decreasing move passes the random check
      decreases relative to the size of the score decrement and the time the phase has been running (which is
      represented as the temperature).</para>

      <para>Simulated Annealing does not always pick the move with the highest score, neither does it evaluate many
      moves per step. At least at first. Instead, it gives non improving moves also a chance to be picked, depending on
      its score and the time gradient of the <literal>Termination</literal>. In the end, it gradually turns into Hill
      Climbing, only accepting improving moves.</para>

      <para>Late Acceptance (also known as Late Acceptance Hill Climbing) also evaluates only a few moves per step. A
      move is accepted if does not decrease the score, or if it leads to a score that is at least the late score (which
      is the winning score of a fixed number of steps ago).</para>

      <para>Step Counting Hill Climbing also evaluates only a few moves per step. For a number of steps, it keeps the

    <title>Using a custom Termination, MoveSelector, EntitySelector, ValueSelector or Acceptor</title>

    <para>You can plug in a custom <literal>Termination</literal>, <literal>MoveSelector</literal>,
    <literal>EntitySelector</literal>, <literal>ValueSelector</literal> or <literal>Acceptor</literal> by extending the
    abstract class and also the related <literal>*Config</literal> class.</para>

    <para>For example, to use a custom <literal>MoveSelector</literal>, extend the
    <literal>AbstractMoveSelector</literal> class, extend the <literal>MoveSelectorConfig</literal> class and configure
    it in the solver configuration.</para>

    <note>
      <para>It's not possible to inject a <literal>Termination</literal>, ... instance directly (to avoid extending a
      <literal>Config</literal> class too) because:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>A <literal>SolverFactory</literal> can build multiple <literal>Solver</literal> instances, which each
          require a distinct <literal>Termination</literal>, ... instance.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>A solver configuration needs to be serializable to and from XML. This makes benchmarking with
          <literal>PlannerBenchmark</literal> particularly easy because you can configure different
          <literal>Solver</literal> variants in XML.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>A <literal>Config</literal> class is often easier and clearer to configure. For example:
          <literal>TerminationConfig</literal> translates <literal>minutesSpentLimit</literal> and
          <literal>secondsSpentLimit</literal> into <literal>timeMillisSpentLimit</literal>.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </note>

    <para>If you build a better implementation that's not domain specific, consider contributing it back as a pull
    request on github: we'll optimize it and take it along in future refactors.</para>
