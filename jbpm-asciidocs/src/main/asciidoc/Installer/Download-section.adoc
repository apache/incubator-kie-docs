= Downloading the Installer

First of all, you need to https://sourceforge.net/projects/jbpm/files/jBPM%206/[download] the 
installer and unzip it to your local file system. There are two versions 

* full installer - which already contains a lot of the dependencies that are necessary during the installation
* minimal installer - which only contains the installer and will download all dependencies

In general, it is probably best to download the full installer: jBPM-{version}-installer-full.zip

You can also find the latest snapshot release here (only minimal installer) here:
