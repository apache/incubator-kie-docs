= Complex Fields Configuration

There are two types of complex fields: fields representing an object, and fields representing an object array. 

Once the field is added to the form, either automatically or manually, it must be configured so that the form had to know how to display the objects that will contain in execution time. 

Next we describe how can be the configuration process: 

* The first thing to do is define how the contained object will be displayed. This is done creating a form that represents the object. 
* In case of the object array, you can define a form to show in preview(edition), or to show when table is shown 


Once the form to represent the object, the parent form has to be configured to use them in the parent Subform or Multiple subform. 

Below we will describe how the setup would be: 

:leveloffset: +1
include::ComplexTypeSubform-section.adoc[]
include::ComplexTypeMultipleSubform-section.adoc[]
:leveloffset: -1
