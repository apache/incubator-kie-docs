= Configuring and using Custom Field Types

Now let's see how to use and configure and use a Custom Field type.
Following the example on the previous chapter, we have created a File Input type and we have it already installed on our application.
So now we are going to create a new form and add a Short Text property and turn it into a File Input and edit the field properties changing the Field Type from _Short text_ to__Custom field__. 

.Changing a field type to__Custom field__

After changing the field type a new set of properties will appear: 

.Custom field properties configuration form

.Custom field properties
[cols="1,1", frame="all", options="header"]
|===
| Property
| Description

|Field type
|Can change the field type to other compatible field types

|Field Name
|Will be used as identifier in formulas calculation

|Label
|The text that will be shown as field label

|Custom field
|A list containing all the Custom Field Types available on the platform

|First parameter
|A String parameter that can be user to pass custom configuration needed by the Custom Field Type implementation

|Second parameter
|A String parameter that can be user to pass custom configuration needed by the Custom Field Type implementation

|Third parameter
|A String parameter that can be user to pass custom configuration needed by the Custom Field Type implementation

|Fourth parameter
|A String parameter that can be user to pass custom configuration needed by the Custom Field Type implementation

|Fifth parameter
|A String parameter that can be user to pass custom configuration needed by the Custom Field Type implementation

|Required
|Indicates if it`'s mandatory to fill this field.

|Read Only
|When this check is on, the field will be used only for read

|Input binding expression
|This expression defines the link between field and process task input variable.
                It will be used in runtime to set the field value with that task input variable data.
              

|Output binding expression
|This expression defines the link between field and process task output variable.
                It will be used in runtime to set that task output variable.

So opening the Custom field select box we'll be able to select the _File Input_ from the available custom types: 

.Available custom types

After selecting the _File Input_ type on the list and saving the field properties the form will look like: 

.Custom type display in a form

If we build a simple process and configure a _Short text_ to be shown as the sample__File Input__, if we build the project on runtime the field will behave uploading the chosen files to the server and allowing the user to download it like this: 

.Choosing the file to upload

.File uploaded, showing the download link

If we take a look at what's the process variable value, we'll see that is storing a String with the file path stored in server.
