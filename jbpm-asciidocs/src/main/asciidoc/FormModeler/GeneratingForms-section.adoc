The Process Designer module provides some functionality to generate the forms automatically from task and variable definitions, as well as easily open the right form from the modeler. 

This is done with the following menu option.

Forms are related to tasks by following a naming convention.
If a form with a name formName-taskform is defined in the same package as the process, then this form is used by the human task engine to display and capture information from user. 

Also, if a form named ProcessId-task form is created, it will be used as the initial form when starting this process. 

For example, for our process the following forms would be generated.
