Now, we want to be able to create, edit and remove purchase order lines, by displaying a table with all the values and being able to capture information through a form.
This will be done as follows: 

Create a form that will hold and capture the information for each line's value (description, amount, unitPrice and total), following the same steps as above.
This will be done as follows: 

. Create new form.

.Configure the parent form

. Customize form. Change display options to improve the form visualization 
. Configure the fields. After creating the basic form structure, we can use a formula to calculate automatically the total field. This formulas and expressions are described in <<_sect_formmodeler_formulasexpression,Formula & expression section>>.
