= Workbench


The workbench is the web-based application that combines all of the above web-based tools into one configurable solution.

It supports the following: 

* A repository service to store your business processes and related artefacts, using a Git repository, which supports versioning, remote accessing (as a file system), and using REST services.
* A web-based user interface to manage your business processes, targeted towards business users; it also supports the visualization (and editing) of your artifacts (the web-based editors like designer, data and form modeler are integrated here), but also categorisation,  build and deployment, etc..
* Collaboration features to have multiple actors (for example business users and developers) work together on the same project.

Workbench application covers complete life cycle of BPM projects starting at authoring phase, going through implementation, execution and monitoring.
