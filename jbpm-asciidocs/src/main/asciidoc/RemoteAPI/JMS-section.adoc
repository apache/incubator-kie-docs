[[remote.jms]]
= JMS
The Java Message Service (JMS) is an API that allows Java Enterprise components to
communicate with each other asynchronously and reliably. 

Operations on the runtime engine and tasks can be done via the JMS API exposed by the jBPM
console and KIE workbench. However, it's not possible to manage deployments or the knowledge
base via this JMS API. 

Unlike the REST API, it is possible to send a batch of commands to the JMS API that will all be processed in one request
after which the responses to the commands will be collected and return in one response message.

== JMS Queue setup

When the Workbench is deployed on the JBoss AS or EAP server, it automatically creates 3
queues: 

* `jms/queue/KIE.SESSION`
* `jms/queue/KIE.TASK`
* `jms/queue/KIE.RESPONSE`

The `KIE.SESSION` and `KIE.TASK` queues should be used to send request messages to the JMS API. 
Command response messages will be then placed on the `KIE.RESPONSE` queues. Command request messages 
that involve starting and managing business processes should be sent to the `KIE.SESSION` and 
command request messages that involve managing human tasks, should be sent to the `KIE.TASK` queue. 

Although there are 2 different input queues, `KIE.SESSION` and `KIE.TASK`, this is only in order to 
provide multiple input queues so as to optimize processing: command request messages will be 
processed in the same manner regardless of which queue they're sent to.  However, in some cases, 
users may send many more requests involving human tasks than requests involving business processes, 
but then not want the processing of business process-related request messages to be delayed by the 
human task messages. By sending the appropriate command request messages to the appropriate queues, 
this problem can be avoided.

The term "_command request message_" used above refers to a JMS text message that contains a 
serialized `JaxbCommandsRequest` object. At the moment, only XML serialization (as opposed to, JSON 
or protobuf, for example) is supported. 

== Using the remote Java API

While it is possible to interact with a BPMS or KIE workbench server instance by sending and 
processing JMS messages that you create yourself, _it will always be easier to use the remote Java 
API_ that's supplied by the `kie-services-client` jar.

For more information about how to use the remote Java API to interact with the JMS API of a server 
instance, see the <link linkend='remote.java.api.jms'>Remote Java API</link> section.

=== Serialization issues

The JMS API accepts `TextMessage` instances that contain serialized `JaxbCommandsRequest` objects. 
These `JaxbCommandsRequest` instances can be filled with multiple command objects. In this way, 
it's possible to send a batch of commands for processing to the JMS API. 

When users wish to include their own classes with requests, there a number of requirements that 
must be met for the user-defined classes. For more information about these requirements, see the 
<<remote.serialization.user.classes,Sending and receiving user class instances>> section in the 
remote API additional documentation section.

== Example JMS usage

The following is a rather long example that shows how to use the JMS API. The numbers ("callouts") 
along the side of the example refer to notes below that explain particular parts of the example. 
It's supplied for those advanced users that do not wish to use the jBPM Remote Java API.

The jBPM Remote Java API, described here, will otherwise take care of all of the logic shown below.

<1> These classes can all be found in the `kie-api`, `kie-services-client` and `kie-services-jaxb` JARs. 
For this example, the only dependency needed is `org.kie.remote:kie-remote-client`, which transitively depends on both the
`org.kie:kie-api` and `org.kie.remote:kie-remote-jaxb` artifacts. 

<2> The `JaxbCommandsRequest` instance is the "holder" object in which you can place all of the commands
you want to execute in a particular request. By using the `JaxbCommandsRequest.getCommands()` method, you 
can retrieve the list of commands in order to add more commands to the request.
A deployment id is required for command request messages that deal with business processes. Command request messages
that only contain human task-related commands do not require a deployment id.

<3> Note that the JMS message sent to the remote JMS API _must_ be constructed as follows:
- It must be a JMS text message (`javax.jms.TextMessage`).
- It must contain a serialized instance of a `JaxbCommandsRequest`, added to the message as a UTF string
- It must have a filled JMS Correlation ID property.
- It must have an int property with the name of "serialization" set to an acceptable value (only 0 at the moment).

<4> The same serialization mechanism used to serialize the request message will be used to serialize the response 
message.

ADD ME
<5> In order to match the response to a command, to the initial command, use the `index` field of the returned
`JaxbCommandResponse` instances. This `index` field will match the index of the initial command. Because
not all commands will return a result, it's possible to send 3 commands with a command request message, and then receive
a command response message that only includes one `JaxbCommandResponse` message with an `index` value of 1. 
That 1 then identifies it as the response to the second command.

<6> Since many of the results returned by various commands are not serializable, the jBPM JMS Remote API converts these results
into JAXB equivalents, all of which implement the `JaxbCommandResponse` interface. The `JaxbCommandResponse.getResult()`
method then returns the JAXB equivalent to the actual result, which will conform to the interface of the result.
For example, in the code above, the `StartProcessCommand` returns a `ProcessInstance`. In order 
to return this object to the requester, the `ProcessInstance` is converted to a `JaxbProcessInstanceResponse` and then
added as a `JaxbCommandResponse` to the command response message. The same applies to the `List&lt;TaskSummary&gt;`
that's returned by the `GetTaskAssignedAsPotentialOwnerCommand`.
However, not all methods that can be called on a normal `ProcessInstance` can be called on the 
`JaxbProcessInstanceResponse`_ because the `JaxbProcessInstanceResponse` is simply a representation
of a `ProcessInstance` object. This applies to various other command response as well. In particular, methods which 
require an active (backing) `KieSession`, such as `ProcessInstance.getProess()` or 
`ProcessInstance.signalEvent(String type, Object event)` will throw an `UnsupportedOperationException`.
