= Remote Java API
  
The Remote Java API provides `KieSession`, `TaskService` and `AuditService` interfaces to the JMS and REST APIs.
    
The interface implementations provided by the Remote Java API take care of the underlying
logic needed to communicate with the JMS or REST APIs. In other words, these implementations
will allow you to interact with a remote workbench instance (i.e. KIE workbench or the jBPM
Console) via known interfaces such as the `KieSession` or `TaskService` interface, 
without having to deal with the underlying transport and serialization details.
    
The first step in interacting with the remote runtime is to use a `RemoteRuntimeEngineFactory` 
static `newRestBuilder()`, `newJmsBuilder()` or `newCommandWebServiceClientBuilder()` to create 
a builder instance. Use the new builder instance to configure and to create a `RuntimeEngine`
instance to interact with the server. 

Each of the REST, JMS or WebService `RemoteClientBuilder` instances exposes different 
methods that allow the configuration of properties like the base URL of the REST API, JMS queue 
locations or timeout while waiting for responses.

[IMPORTANT]
.The Remote Java API provides clients, not "instances"
======
While the `KieSession`, `TaskSerivce` and `AuditService` instances provided by the Remote Java API 
may "look" and "feel" like local instances of the same interfaces, please make sure to remember 
that these instances are only wrappers around a REST or jMS client that interacts with a remote REST or JMS
API. + 

{nbsp} +

This means that if a requested operation fails on the _server_, the Remote Java API client instance 
on the _client_ side will throw a `RuntimeException` indicating that the REST call failed. This is 
different from the behaviour of a "real" (or local) instance of a `KieSession`, `TaskSerivce` and 
`AuditService` instance because the exception the local instances will throw will relate to how the 
operation failed. Operations on a Remote Java API client instance that would normally throw other 
exceptions (such as the `TaskService.claim(taskId, userId)` operation when called by a user who is 
not a potential owner), will now throw a `RuntimeException` instead when the requested operation 
fails on the server. +

{nbsp} +

Also, while local instances require different handling (such as having to dispose of a `KieSession`),
client instances provided by the Remote Java API hold no state and thus do not require any special 
handling. + 

{nbsp} +

Finally, the instances returned by the client `KieSession` and `TaskService` instances (for example, 
process instances or task summaries) are not the same (internal) objects as used by the core engines. 
Instead, these returned instances are simple data transfer objects (DTOs) that implement the same 
interfaces but are designed to only return the associated data. Modifying or casting these returned 
instances to an internal implementation class will not succeed.

.Creating a Remote Java Client Instance
****************************************************************************************************
The following is a simple example of creating a REST-based client. The `appName` variable in the
code below will be either "business-central" or "kie-wb" dependending on whether you're using product 
or community.

<1> Create the appropriate builder instance. The method `.newJmsBuilder()` is available to create JMS 
based builder instances
<2> Call the appropriate methods and pass the appropriate parameters to configure the client

interact with the server
****************************************************************************************************

== Remote REST Java API Client Configuration

Each builder has a number of different (required or optional) methods to configure a client 
`RuntimeEngine` instance. 

- Methods with *^always^* next to them are *always* required.
- Methods with ^when^ next to them are _required depending on the factors described_ 
("required _when_...") and otherwise optional.
- All other methods are optional. 

.Remote Rest Runtime Engine Builder methods

*`addDeploymentId(String deploymentId)`*^when^:: Set the deployment id of the deployment

_Required when_:;; doing an operation on a client instance that affects a process instance
*`addExtraJaxbClasses(Class... extraJaxbClasses )`*^when^:: Add extra classes to the classpath available 
to the serialization mechanisms

When passing instances of user-defined classes in a Remote Java API call, it's important to 
use this method first to add the classes so that the class instances can be serialized correctly.

The default is 5 seconds. 
*`addUrl(URL serverInstanceUrl)`^always^*:: Set the URL for the application instance

This should be a URL that roughly corresponds to `http://server:port/business-central/` 
or `http://server:port/kie-wb/`. 
*`addUserName(String userName)`^always^*:: Set the name of the user connecting to the server
*`clearJaxbClasses()`*:: Clears the list of (user-defined) Classes that the client instance should
know about

[[remote.java.api.jms]]         
== Remote JMS Java API Client Configuration

When configuring the remote JMS client, you must choose one of the following ways to configure
the JMS connection:

. Pass the `ConnectionFactory` instance and the _KieSession_, _TaskService_ and _Response_ `Queue`
  instances when configuring the remote java client. To do that, please use the following methods:
  - `addConnectionFactory(ConnectionFactory)`
  - `addKieSessionQueue(Queue)`
  - `addTaskServiceQueue(Queue)`
  - `addResponseQueue(Queue)`
  - `addHostName(String)`
  - `addJmsConnectorPort(String)`
. _or_ pass a remote `InitialContext` instance that contains references to the necessary
  `ConnectionFactory` and `Queue` instances (see previous bullet). 
  - please then use the method `addRemoteInitialContext(InitialContext)`
. _or_ pass a String with the hostname of the JBoss EAP server that KIE Workbench is running on
  - please then use the method `addJbossServerHostName(String)`

In addition, if you are doing an operation on a task via the remote JMS client (and are not
using the `disableTaskSecurity()` method), then you must also configure SSL. The following methods
(described in more detail below) are available for this: 

- `addHostName(String)`
- `addJmsConnectorPort(int)`
- `addKeystoreLocation(String)`
- `addKeystorePassword(String)`
- `addTruststoreLocation(String)`
- `addTruststorePassword(String)`
- `useKeystoreAsTruststore()`

[IMPORTANT]
====================================================================================================
In order to instantiate a remote `InitialContext` via JNDI, the application-server-specific 
dependencies need to be included on the classpath.  

For JBoss EAP 6, the artifact (jar) containing this class is the
`org.jboss:jboss-remote-naming` artifact (jar), version
`1.0.5.Final` or higher. Depending on the version of AS 7 or EAP 6 that you
use, this version may vary.

If you are using a _different_ application server, please see your specific
application server documentation for the parameters and artifacts necessary to create an
`InitialContextFactory` instance or otherwise get a remote
`InitialContext` instance (via JNDI) from the application server instance.
====================================================================================================

=== Example JMS client configuration and usage with SSL


The following example illustrates how to configure a Remote Java API JMS client using
a remote `InitialContext` instance along with SSL. In this case, the same file is being used as
both the client's keystore (the client's identifying keys and certificates) and as the client's 
truststore (the client's list of trusted certificates from other parties, in this case, the server).

== Remote REST Java API exceptions
      
Because the Remote REST Java API clients implement the existing `KieSession`,
`TaskService` and `AuditService` interfaces, the exceptions thrown by the 
client implementations must be instances of a `RuntimeException`.
      
The table below lists the exceptions thrown by the different client interfaces.

== Supported methods
    
As mentioned above, the Remote Java API provides client-like instances of the `RuntimeEngine`, `KieSession`,
      `TaskService` and `AuditService` interfaces.
    
This means that while many of the methods in those interfaces are available, some are not. The following tables lists the methods
      which are available. Methods not listed in the below, will throw an `UnsupportedOperationException` explaining that the 
      called method is not available.
