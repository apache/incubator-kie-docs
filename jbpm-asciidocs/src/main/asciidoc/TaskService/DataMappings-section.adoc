= Data Mappings


Human tasks typically present some data related to the task that needs to be performed to the  actor that is executing the task and usually also request the actor to provide some result data related to the  execution of the task.
Task forms are typically used to present this data to the actor and request results. 

The data that will be used by the Task needs to be specified when we define the User Task in our Process.
In  order to do that we need to define which data will be copied from the process context to the task context.
Notice that the data is copied, so it can be modified inside the Task context but it will not affect the process variables unless we decide to copy back the value from the task to the process context.
 

Most of the times Forms are used to display data to the end user.
Allowing them to generate/create new data that will be propagated to the process context to be used by future activities.
In order to decide how the information flow from the process to a particular task and from the task to the process we need to define which pieces of information will be automatically copied by the process engine.
The following sections shows how to do these mappings by configuring the DataInputSet, DataOutputSet and the Assignments properties of a User Task.
 

Let's start defining the Task **DataInputSet**:

Both GroupId and Comment are automatically generated, so you don't need to worry about that.
In this case the only user defined Data Input is called: **in_name**.
This means that the task will be receiving information from the process context and internally this variable will be called in_name.
The type is also specified here. 

In the *Data Outputs* represent the data that will be generated by the tasks.
In this case we have two variables of type String called: *out_name* and *out_mail* and two Integer variables called: *out_age* and *out_score* are defined.
This means that inside the task context we will need to set the value to these variables.

Finally all the connections with the process context needs to be done in the **Data Assignments**.
The main idea here is to define how Data Inputs and Data Outputs will be associated with process variables.

As shown  in the previous screenshot, the assignments between the process variables (in this case (**name, age, mail and hr_score**)) and the Data Inputs and Outputs are done in the Data Assignments screen.
Notice that the example uses a convention that makes it easy to know which is an internal Task variables (Data Input/Output) using the "**in_**" and "**out_**" prefix to the variable names.
Using this convention you can quickly understand the Assignments screen.
The first row maps the process variable called *name* to the data input called **in_name**.
The second row maps the data output called *out_mail* to the process variable called **mail**, and so on.

These mappings at runtime will automatically copy the variables content from one context (process and task) to the other automatically for us.
