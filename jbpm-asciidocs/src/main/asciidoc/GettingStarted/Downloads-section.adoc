All releases can be downloaded from https://sourceforge.net/projects/jbpm/files/[SourceForge].
Select the version you want to download and then select which artifact you want:

* bin: all the jBPM binaries (JARs) and their dependencies
* src: the sources of the core components
* docs: the documentation
* examples: some jBPM examples, can be imported into Eclipse
* installer: the jbpm-installer, downloads and installs a demo setup of jBPM
* installer-full: the jbpm-installer, downloads and installs a demo setup of jBPM, already contains a number of dependencies prepackages (so they don't need to be downloaded separately)
