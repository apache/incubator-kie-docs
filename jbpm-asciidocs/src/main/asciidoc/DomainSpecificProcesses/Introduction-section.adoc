jBPM provides the ability to create and use domain-specific task nodes in your business  processes.
This simplifies development when you're creating business processes that contain tasks  dealing with other technical systems.

When using jBPM, we call these domain-specific task nodes "__custom work 
items__" or (custom) "__service nodes__". There are two separate aspects  to creating and using custom work items:  

* Adding a node with a custom work item to a process definition using the Eclipse 
  editor or jBPM designer.
* Creating a custom _work item handler_ that the jBPM engine will  use when executing the custom work item in a running process.


With regards to a BPMN2 process, custom work items are certain types of  `<task>` nodes.
In most cases, custom work items are `<task>`  nodes in a BPMN2 process definition, although they can also be used with certain other task type  nodes such as, among others, `<serviceTask>` or  `<sendTask>` nodes.

[TIP]
====
When creating custom work items, it's important to separate the data associated with the  work item, from how the work item should be handled.
In other words, separate the  _what_ from the __how__.
That means that custom work items  should be: 

* declarative (what, not how)
* high-level (no code)

On the other hand, custom work item __handlers__, which are Java classes,  should be: 

* procedural (how, not what)
* low-level (because it's code!)

Work item handlers should almost never contain any data.

Users can thus easily define their own set of domain-specific service nodes and integrate  them with the process language.
For example, the next figure shows an example of a  healthcare-related BPMN2 process.
The process includes domain-specific service nodes for measuring  blood pressure, prescribing medication, notifying care providers and following-up on the patient.
