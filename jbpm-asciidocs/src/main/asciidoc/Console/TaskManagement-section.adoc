= Tasks

This chapter introduces the Task Management screens and the its integration with the Form Modeller component to allow users to work on their assigned tasks.
You can find the source code of these screens here: https://github.com/droolsjbpm/jbpm-console-ng/tree/master/jbpm-console-ng-human-tasks[https://github.com/droolsjbpm/jbpm-console-ng/tree/master/jbpm-console-ng-human-tasks
              ] . Feel free to report issues, send Pull Requests and get in contact with the team via comments in github.
At the end of this section you will find a technical description about how to customize these views. 

== Task List

Every user with access to the platform will have access to its personal task list where tasks assigned to him/her will be displayed.
Each user will be able to create its own personal tasks or work on tasks that were create as a result of a business process execution.

You can access to the Task List accessing *Tasks*                     main menu:

=== Task List (Personal and Group Tasks)

Pending tasks for each user will be displayed in their task list screen.
Notice that you will not be able to see assigned tasks from another user different from the one that is currenlty logged in.

==== Task List 

The list will show all the tasks that match with the defined restrictions ordered by the columns presented.
You can change the default ordering clicking on the column header.
This view offer a more traditional BPM Task List view where you can sort the data based on different columns.

Here appears again the concept of view versus just filtering as we explained in the process instante list.
The default views here have the following restrictions over the tasks to show:



* *Active:* all the Active tasks that user can work on.
  That means Personal and Group Tasks.
* *Personal:* all the personal tasks that already belong to the user. 
* *Group:* all the group tasks that needs to be claimed by the user in order to start working on them.
* *All:* show all the tasks no matter the status.
  It will show completed tasks as well with the exception of completed tasks that belongs to a process that is already finished.
  In such cases the tasks are cleaned up after the process is completed and for that reason they will not be displayed.
* *Admin:* show all the tasks where the currently logged user was set as business administrator for such task. 



[NOTE]
====
The user can always restore the default filters selecting the option 'Restore default filters'

==== Task List custom filters. Ability to show bussiness data at task list.

As was explained in the process instance list, the user can define custom filters adding new tab and defining restrictions over task data in this case.

The user can now create a specific filter that provides domain specific columns to be added to a task list.
When the user creates a custom filter for a specific task name the task variables are enabled as columns. 

.Basic available columns that every task list allows select to be displayed.

The custom filter that activates the capability to display task variables as columns is set a filter with the restriction Name="taskName".

.Filter by task name creation

When the filter with the restriction over a specific task name is applied, the task associated variables appear as a selectable columns, to the task list.

=== Task Details

You can access to the Task Details by clicking in a task row.
The details associated with a task can be changed, like for example the Due Date, the Priority or the task description.

The task details appear in a new region with different sections that allow view the task associated information: 

*Work* In this tab the associated form is displayed if the task has one.
In this section is where the user can interact with the process, executing the available actions in each moment. 

*Details* Here the basic task data is accessible: priority, status, description

*Process Context* Data related with the process instance associated.
If the task was created by a Business Process, you will have access to see the Process Instance status that has created it.

*Assignments* The Task Assignments tab allows you to delegate the task to another person or group if you are not able to continue working on it.

*Comments* You can also add while you are working on a task comments about the progress.

=== Work on a Task

Tasks can have associated a Form to store data.
If tasks are part of a Business Process, usually some data needs to be collected and propagated to the business process for further usage.
For that reason, tasks has to provide a way to gather and store data.
Forms can be created for specific tasks using the Form Modeller.
If no form is provided a dynamic form will be created based on the information that the task needs to handle.
If a task is created as an ad-hoc task (not related with any process) there will be no such information to generate a form and only basic actions will be provided.

=== Task Forms generated by the Form Modeller

As part of your projects you can model your forms for your human tasks,  providing a rich interface for collecting data.
This shows the Form Modeller canvas while designing the previously Task Form.

== New Task (Ad-Hoc Task)

As mentioned in the introduction a User can create their own tasks, which will not be associated with any Business Process.
These tasks can be used to keep track of your personal list of TO DOs.
You can also create tasks and assign them to different people in your team or group. 


image::Console/task-new-task.png[]

At the advanced tab the user can define information like priority or the task due on date.


image::Console/task-new-task-advanced.png[]

When a user creates a new task, can associate an existing form.
At the 'Form' tab, the deployment id has to be selected from the list of available deployments id 


image::Console/task-new-task-form-deployment.png[]

In that moment, the next list of form names is filled with the available forms at that deployment.

Once the 'Create' button has been selected, a task is created with the associated form and the status 'In Progress'. The complete action on task shows the selected form.
