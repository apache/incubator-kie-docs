//@comment: As we add other related content about architecture (such as process management architecture), we can expand this title, add a parent title with intro, and context, and broaden the master-docinfo file, like we have with the other multi-assembly titles. See others for an example to follow when the time comes. (Stetson, 10 Aug 2020)
