//@Misha: I moved the consolidated list of product assemblies and accompanying master-docinfo file for bigbuild here in the titles folder, reformatted to direct to the consolidated title IDs instead of individual assembly IDs, and renamed to `titles-DM` and `titles-PAM` accordingly. The idea is for the bigbuild to build all of the title files, which would then give us the new doc title divisions. Hopefully the nesting won't be too badly impacted with how I've set up the component "parts", but I was curious to see how it would go. Would you be able to tweak an altered version of the bigbuild script so we could see how it went?
