  <para>As stated before, both Data Objects as well as Fields require
    some of their initial properties to be set upon creation. Additionally there are three domains of properties that
    can be configured for a given Data Object. A domain is basically a set of properties related to a given business area.
    Current available domains are, "Drools &amp; jJBPM", "Persistence" and the "Advanced" domain.
    To work on a given domain the user should select the corresponding "Tool window" (see below) on the right side toolbar.
    Every tool window usually provides two editors, the "Data Object" level editor and the "Field" level editor, that will
    be shown depending on the last selected item, the Data Object or the Field.

        <listitem>
          <para>TypeSafe: this property allows to enable/disable the type safe behaviour for current type.
            By default all type declarations are compiled with type safety enabled. (See Drools for more information
            on this matter).
          </para>

        <listitem>
          <para>ClassReactive: this property allows to mark this type to be treated as "Class Reactive" by the Drools engine.

          </para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Role: this property allows to configure how the Drools engine should handle instances of this type: either as
            regular facts or as events. By default all types are handled as a regular fact, so for the time being the
            only value that can be set is "Event" to declare that this type should be handled as an event.
            (See Drools Fusion for more information on this matter).
          </para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Timestamp: this property allows to configure the "timestamp" for an event, by selecting one of his attributes.
            If set the engine will use the timestamp from the given attribute instead of reading it from the Session Clock.
            If not, the engine will automatically assign a timestamp to the event.
            (See Drools Fusion for more information on this matter).

        <listitem>
          <para>Duration: this property allows to configure the "duration" for an event, by selecting one of his attributes.
            If set the engine will use the duration from the given attribute instead of using the default event duration = 0.
            (See Drools Fusion for more information on this matter).
          </para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Expires: this property allows to configure the "time offset" for an event expiration.
            If set, this value must be a temporal interval in the form: [#d][#h][#m][#s][#[ms]] Where [ ] means an
            optional parameter and # means a numeric value.
            e.g.: 1d2h, means one day and two hours.

            <para>Is Identifier: marks current field as the Data Object identifier.
              A persistable Data Object should have one and only one field marked as identifier, and it should be a base java type,
              like String, Integer, Long, etc.
              A field that references a Data Object, or is a multiple field can not be marked as identifier. And also
              composite identifiers are not supported in this version.
              When a persistable Data Object is created an identifier field is created by default with the properly initializations,

        When the field's type is a Data Object type, or a list of a Data Object type a relationship type should be
        set in order to let the persistence provider to manage the relation. Fortunately this relation type is
        automatically set when such kind of fields are added to an already marked as persistable Data Object.
        The relationship type is set by the following popup.

          <para>
            One to one: typically used for 1:1 relations where "A is related to one instance of B", and B exists only when A exists.
            e.g. PurchaseOrder &#45;&gt; PurchaseOrderHeader (a PurchaseOrderHeader exists only if the PurchaseOrder exists)
          </para>

          <para>
            One to many: typically used for 1:N relations where "A is related to N instances of B", and the related
            instances of B exists only when A exists.
            e.g. PurchaseOrder &#45;&gt; PurchaseOrderLine (a PurchaseOrderLine exists only if the PurchaseOrder exists)
          </para>

          <para>
            Many to one: typically used for 1:1 relations where "A is related to one instance of B", and B can exist even without A.
            e.g. PurchaseOrder &#45;&gt; Client (a Client can exist in the database even without an associated PurchaseOrder)
          </para>

          <para>
            Many to many: typically used for N:N relations where "A can be related to N instances of B, and B can be
            related to M instances of A at the same time", and both B an A instances can exits in the database independently
            of the related instances.
            e.g. Course &#45;&gt; Student. (Course can be related to N Students, and a given Student can attend to M courses)
          </para>

          <para>
            When a field of type "Data Object" is added to a given persistable Data Object, the "Many to One" relationship type is generated by default.
          </para>

          <para>
            And when a field of type "list of Data Object" is added to a given persistable Data Object , the "One to Many" relationship
            is generated by default.
          </para>

        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Cascade mode: Defines the set of cascadable operations that are propagated to the associated entity.
            The value cascade&#61;ALL is equivalent to cascade&#61;&#123;PERSIST, MERGE, REMOVE, REFRESH&#125;.
            e.g. when A &#45;&gt; B, and cascade "PERSIST or ALL" is set, if A is saved, then B will be also saved.
          </para>
          <para>
            The by default cascade mode created by the data modeller is "ALL" and it's strongly recommended to use this
            mode when Data Objects are being used by jBPM processes and forms.

            read at the same time.
          </para>
          <para>
            LAZY: reading of related data will be delayed usually to the moment they are required. e.g. If PurchaseOrder &#45;&gt; PurchaseOrderLine
            the lines reading will be postponed until a method "getLines()" is invoked on a PurchaseOrder instance.
          </para>

          <para>
            The default fetch mode created by the data modeller is "EAGER" and it's strongly recommended to use this
