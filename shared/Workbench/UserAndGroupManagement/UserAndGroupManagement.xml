    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>This section describes a feature that allows the administration of the application's users
      and groups using an intuitive and friendly user interface that comes integrated in both jBPM
      and Drools Workbenches.<figure>

    <title>Security management providers</title>
    <para>A security environment is usually provided by the use of a <emphasis>realm</emphasis>.
      Realms are used to restrict the access for the different application's resources. So realms
      contains information about the users, groups, roles, permissions and and any other related
      information.</para>
    <para>In most of the typical scenarios the application's security is delegated to the
      container's security mechanism, which consumes a given realm at same time. It's important to
      consider that there exist several realm implementations, for example Wildfly provides a realm
      based on the
        <emphasis>application-users.properties</emphasis>/<emphasis>application-roles.properties</emphasis>
      files, Tomcat provides a realm based on the <emphasis>tomcat-users.xml</emphasis> file, etc.
      So keep in mind that there is no single security realm to rely on, it can be different in each
      installation.</para>
    <para>The jBPM and Drools workbenches are not an exception, they're build on top Uberfire
      framework (aka UF), which delegates the authorization and authentication to the underlying
      container's security environment as well, so the consumed realm is given by the concrete
      deployment configuration.</para>
    <section>
      <title>Security management providers</title>
      <para>Due to the potential different security environments that have to be supported, the
        users and groups management provides a well defined management services API with some
        default built-in security management providers. A <emphasis role="bold">security management
          provider</emphasis> is the formal name given to a concrete user and group management
        service implementation for a given realm.</para>
      <para>At this moment, by default there are two security management providers available:<itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Wildfly / EAP security management provider</emphasis> - For
              Wildfly or EAP realms based on properties files.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Tomcat security management provider</emphasis> - For Tomcat
              realms based on XML files.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist></para>
      <para>If the built-in providers do not fit with the application's security realm, it is easy
        to build and register your own security management provider.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Secutiry management provider capabilities</title>
      <para>Each security realm can provide support different operations. For example consider the
        use of a Wildfly's realm based on properties files, The contents for the
        applications-users.properties is
        like:<programlisting>admin=207b6e0cc556d7084b5e2db7d822555c
salaboy=d4af256e7007fea2e581d539e05edd1b

kieserver=16c6511893651c9b4b57e0c027a96075</programlisting></para>
      <para>Note that it's based on key-value pairs where the key is the
          <emphasis>username</emphasis>, and the value is the hashed value for the user's
          <emphasis>password</emphasis>. So a user is just defined by the key, by its username, it
        does not have a name nor address or any other meta information.</para>
      <para>On the other hand, consider the use of a realm provided by a Keycloak server. The
        information for a user is composed by more user meta-data, such as surname, address, etc, as
        in the following image:</para>
      <figure>
        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="images/Workbench/UserAndGroupManagement/admin_user_view.png"/>
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>
      <para>So the different services and client side components from the users and group management
        API are based on <emphasis>capabilities</emphasis>.<emphasis role="bold"
          >Capabilities</emphasis> are used to expose or restrict the available functionality
        provided by the different services and client side components. Examples of capabilities are:<itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Create a user</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Update a user</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Delete a user</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Update user's attributes</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Create a group</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Update a group</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Assign groups to a user</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Assign roles to a user</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist></para>
      <para>Each security management provider must specify a set of capabilities supported. From the
        previous examples you can note that the Wildfly security management provider does not
        support the capability for the management of the attributes for a user - the user is only
        composed by the user name. On the other hand the Keycloak provider does support this
        capability.</para>
      <para>The different views and user interface components rely on the capabilities supported by
        each provider, so if a capability is not supported by the provider in use, the UI does not
        provide the views for the management of that capability. As an example, consider that a
        concrete provider does not support deleting users - the delete user button on the user
        interface will be not available.</para>
      <para>Please take a look at the concrete service provider documentation to check all the
        supported capabilities for each one, the default ones can be found <link

      jBPM distributions come with built-in, pre-installed security management providers by default:<itemizedlist>

      deployment environment.</para>
    <para>On the other hand, if using a custom security management provider or need to include it on
      an existing application, consider the following installation options:<itemizedlist>
        <listitem>

        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist></para>
    <para><emphasis>NOTE</emphasis>: If no security management provider is installed in the
      application, there will be no available user interface for managing the security realm. Once a
      security management provider is installed and setup, the user and group management user
      interfaces are automatically enabled and accessible from the main menu.</para>
