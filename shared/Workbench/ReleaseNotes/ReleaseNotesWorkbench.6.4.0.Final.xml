  <title>New and Noteworthy in KIE Workbench 6.4.0</title>

  <section>
    <title>Authoring - Imports - Consistent terminology</title>
    <para>The Workbench used to have a section in the Project Editor for "Import Suggestions" which
      was really a way for Users to register classes provided by the Java Runtime environment to be
      available to Rule authoring. Furthermore Editors had a "Config" tab which was where Users were
      expected to import classes from other packages to that in which the rule resides.</para>
    <para>Neither term was clear and both were inconsistent with each other and other aspects of the Workbench.</para>
    <para>We have changed these terms to (hopefully) be clearer in their meaning and to be
      consistent with the "Data Object" term used in relation to authoring Java classes within the
      Workbench.</para>

      <para>The Data Object screen lists all Data Objects in the same package as the asset and allows other Data Objects from other packages to be imported.</para>

    <title>Disable automatic build</title>
    <para>When navigating Projects with the Project Explorer the workbench automatically builds the selected project, displaying build messages in the 
      Message Console. Whilst this is beneficial it can have a detremental impact on performance of the workbench when authoring large projects. The 
      automatic build can now be disabled with the <code>org.kie.build.disable-project-explorer</code> System Property. Set the value 
      to <code>true</code> to disable. The default value is <code>false</code>.</para>
