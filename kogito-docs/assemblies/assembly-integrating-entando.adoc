With AppBuilder, you can create a custom user experience around your {PRODUCT} business assets and expand your application development strategy.

.Prerequisites
* {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} is installed. For installation options, see {URL_INSTALLING_AND_CONFIGURING}#assembly-planning[_{PLANNING_INSTALL}_].
* A project with business assets has been created in {PRODUCT} and deployed to a {KIE_SERVER}. For instructions, see {URL_DEPLOYING_AND_MANAGING_SERVICES}#assembly-packaging-deploying[_{PACKAGING_DEPLOYING_PROJECT}_].
