= Implementing high available event-driven decisioning using the {DECISION_ENGINE} on {OPENSHIFT}
ifdef::context[:parent-context: {context}]
// Context attribute is assembly specific and enables module reuse between assemblies.
:context: hacep

// Purpose statement for the assembly
As a business rules developer, you can use high available event-driven decisioning, including Complex Event Processing (CEP), in your code that uses the {DECISION_ENGINE}. You can implement high available event-driven decisioning on {OPENSHIFT}.

You cannot use a standard deployment of {PRODUCT} on {OPENSHIFT}, as described in {URL_DEPLOYING_ON_OPENSHIFT}#assembly-openshift-operator[_{DEPLOYING_OPENSHIFT_OPERATOR}_], to implement high available event-driven decisioning, because the standard deployment supports only stateless processing. You must therefore create a custom implementation using the provided reference implementation.

.Prerequisites

* A {OPENSHIFT} {OPENSHIFT_VERSION_SHORT} environment is available. For the exact versions of {OPENSHIFT} that the current release supports, see
ifdef::PAM[]
https://access.redhat.com/articles/3405381[{PRODUCT} 7 Supported Configurations].
endif::[]
ifdef::DM[]
https://access.redhat.com/articles/3354301[{PRODUCT} 7 Supported Configurations].

* A Kafka Cluster is deployed in the OpenShift environment with Red Hat AMQ Streams.
* The OpenJDK Java development environment is installed.
* Maven, Docker, and kubectl are installed.
* The `oc` OpenShift command line tool is installed.
