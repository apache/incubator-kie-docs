// Purpose statement for the assembly
This document describes how to use Ansible and {PRODUCT} technology in Open Network Architecture Platform (ONAP) architecture. This explains how automation and rules management systems can provide a comprehensive network policy engine. The proposed policy engine provides the necessary automations for proactive response to network and service conditions without human intervention. This is also known as closed loop automation. ONAP is a open source networking project that provides a platform for real-time, policy-driven orchestration and automation of physical and virtual network functions. ONAP enables service providers to rapidly automate new services and support complete lifecycle management.
