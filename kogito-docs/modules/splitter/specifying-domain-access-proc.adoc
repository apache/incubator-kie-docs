= Specifying {PLANNER_SHORT} domain access

By default, OptaPlanner accesses your domain using reflection. Reflection is reliable but slow compared to direct access. Alternatively, you can configure OptaPlanner to access your domain using Gizmo, which will generate bytecode that directly accesses the
fields and methods of your domain without reflection. However, this method has the following restrictions:

* The planning annotations can only be on public fields and
  public getters.
* `io.quarkus.gizmo:gizmo` must be on the classpath.

NOTE: These restrictions do not apply when you use OptaPlanner with Quarkus because Gizmo is the default domain access type.

.Procedure
To use Gizmo outside of Quarkus, set the `domainAccessType` in the
solver configuration:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
  <solver>
    <domainAccessType>GIZMO</domainAccessType>
  </solver>
