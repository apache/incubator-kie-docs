= Monitoring the solver
{PLANNER_SHORT} exposes metrics through https://micrometer.io/[Micrometer], a metrics instrumentation library for Java applications. You can use Micrometer with popular monitoring systems to monitor the {PLANNER_SHORT} solver.

== Configuring a Quarkus {PLANNER_SHORT} application for Micrometer
To configure your {PLANNER_SHORT} Quarkus application to use Micrometer and a specified monitoring system, add the Micrometer dependency to the `pom.xml` file.

.Prerequisites

.Procedure
. Add the following dependency to your application's `pom.xml` file where `<MONITORING_SYSTEM>` is a monitoring system supported by Micrometer and Quarkus:
+
NOTE: Prometheus is currently the only monitoring system supported by Quarkus.
+
[source]
----
<dependency>
 <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>

== Configuring a plain Java {PLANNER_SHORT} application for Micrometer
To configuring a plain Java {PLANNER_SHORT} application to use Micrometer, you must add Micrometer dependencies and configuration information for your chosen monitoring system to your project's `POM.XML` file.


.Prerequisites
* You have a plain Java {PLANNER_SHORT} application.

.Procedure
. Add the following dependencies to your application's `pom.xml` file where `<MONITORING_SYSTEM>` is a monitoring system that is configured with Micrometer and `<VERSION>` is the version of Micrometer that you are using:
+
[source]
----
<dependency>
 <groupId>io.micrometer</groupId>
 <artifactId>micrometer-registry-<MONITORING_SYSTEM></artifactId>
 <version><VERSION></version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
 <groupId>io.micrometer</groupId>
 <artifactId>micrometer-core</artifactId>
 <version>`<VERSION>`</version>
</dependency>
----
. Add Micrometer configuration information for your monitoring system to the beginning of your project's `pom.xml` file. For information, see the https://micrometer.io[Micrometer] web site.
. Add the following line below the configuration information, where `<MONITORING_SYSTEM>` is the monitoring system that you added:
+
[source,java,nowrap]
----
Metrics.addRegistry(<MONITORING_SYSTEM>);
----
The following example shows how to add the Prometheus monitoring system:
+
[source,java,nowrap]
----
PrometheusMeterRegistry prometheusRegistry = new PrometheusMeterRegistry(PrometheusConfig.DEFAULT);
try {
    HttpServer server = HttpServer.create(new InetSocketAddress(8080), 0);
    server.createContext("/prometheus", httpExchange -> {
        String response = prometheusRegistry.scrape();
        httpExchange.sendResponseHeaders(200, response.getBytes().length);
        try (OutputStream os = httpExchange.getResponseBody()) {
            os.write(response.getBytes());
        }
    });
    new Thread(server::start).start();
} catch (IOException e) {
    throw new RuntimeException(e);
}
Metrics.addRegistry(prometheusRegistry);
----

. Open your monitoring system to view the metrics for your {PLANNER_SHORT} project. The following metrics are exposed:
+
[NOTE]
====
The names and format of the metrics vary depending on the registry.
====
+
* `optaplanner.solver.errors.total`: the total number of errors that occurred while solving since the start
of the measuring.
* `optaplanner.solver.solve-length.active-count`: the number of solvers currently solving.
* `optaplanner.solver.solve-length.seconds-max`: run time of the
longest-running currently active solver.
* `optaplanner.solver.solve-length.seconds-duration-sum`: the sum of each active solver's solve duration. For example, if there are two active solvers, one running for three minutes and the other for one minute, the total solve time is four minutes.

== Additional Metrics

For more detailed monitoring, you can configure {PLANNER_SHORT} in the solver configuration to monitor additional metrics at a performance cost. The following example uses the `BEST_SCORE` and `SCORE_CALCULATION_COUNT` metric :

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<solver xmlns="https://www.optaplanner.org/xsd/solver" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="https://www.optaplanner.org/xsd/solver https://www.optaplanner.org/xsd/solver/solver.xsd">
  <monitoring>
    <metric>BEST_SCORE</metric>
    <metric>SCORE_CALCULATION_COUNT</metric>
    ...
  </monitoring>
  ...
</solver>
----

You can enable the following metrics in this configuration:

* `SOLVE_DURATION` (enabled by default, Micrometer meter ID: `optaplanner.solver.solve.duration`): Measures the duration of solving for the longest active solver, the number of active solvers, and the cumulative duration of all active solvers.

* `ERROR_COUNT` (enabled by default, Micrometer meter ID: `optaplanner.solver.errors`): Measures the number of errors that occurred while solving.

* `SCORE_CALCULATION_COUNT` (enabled by default, Micrometer meter ID: `optaplanner.solver.score.calculation.count`): Measures the number of score calculations the {PLANNER_SHORT} performed.

* `BEST_SCORE` (Micrometer meter ID: `optaplanner.solver.best.score.*`): Measures the score of the best solution that {PLANNER_SHORT} has found so far. There are separate meters for each level of the score. For instance, for a `HardSoftScore`, there are `optaplanner.solver.best.score.hard.score` and `optaplanner.solver.best.score.soft.score` meters.

* `STEP_SCORE` (Micrometer meter ID: `optaplanner.solver.step.score.*`): Measures the score of each step that {PLANNER_SHORT} takes. There are separate meters for each level of the score. For instance, for a `HardSoftScore`, there are `optaplanner.solver.step.score.hard.score` and `optaplanner.solver.step.score.soft.score` meters.

* `BEST_SOLUTION_MUTATION` (Micrometer meter ID: `optaplanner.solver.best.solution.mutation`): Measures the number of changed planning variables between consecutive best solutions.

* `MOVE_COUNT_PER_STEP` (Micrometer meter ID: `optaplanner.solver.step.move.count`): Measures the number of moves evaluated in a step.

* `MEMORY_USE` (Micrometer meter ID: `jvm.memory.used`): Measures the amount of memory used across the JVM. This metric does not measure the amount of memory used by a solver; two solvers on the same JVM will report the same value for this metric.

* `CONSTRAINT_MATCH_TOTAL_BEST_SCORE` (Micrometer meter ID: `optaplanner.solver.constraint.match.best.score.*`): Measures the score impact of each constraint on the best solution that {PLANNER_SHORT} has found so far. There are separate meters for each level of the score, with tags for each constraint. For instance, for a `HardSoftScore` for a constraint "Minimize Cost" in package "com.example", there are `optaplanner.solver.constraint.match.best.score.hard.score` and `optaplanner.solver.constraint.match.best.score.soft.score` meters with tags "constraint.package=com.example" and "constraint.name=Minimize Cost".

* `CONSTRAINT_MATCH_TOTAL_STEP_SCORE` (Micrometer meter ID: `optaplanner.solver.constraint.match.step.score.*`): Measures the score impact of each constraint on the current step. There are separate meters for each level of the score, with tags for each constraint. For instance, for a `HardSoftScore` for a constraint "Minimize Cost" in package "com.example", there are `optaplanner.solver.constraint.match.step.score.hard.score` and `optaplanner.solver.constraint.match.step.score.soft.score` meters with tags "constraint.package=com.example" and "constraint.name=Minimize Cost".

* `PICKED_MOVE_TYPE_BEST_SCORE_DIFF` (Micrometer meter ID: `optaplanner.solver.move.type.best.score.diff.*`): Measures how much a particular move type improves the best solution. There are separate meters for each level of the score, with a tag for the move type. For instance, for a `HardSoftScore` and a `ChangeMove` for the computer of a process, there are `optaplanner.solver.move.type.best.score.diff.hard.score` and `optaplanner.solver.move.type.best.score.diff.soft.score` meters with the tag `move.type=ChangeMove(Process.computer)`.

* `PICKED_MOVE_TYPE_STEP_SCORE_DIFF` (Micrometer meter ID: `optaplanner.solver.move.type.step.score.diff.*`): Measures how much a particular move type improves the best solution. There are separate meters for each level of the score, with a tag for the move type. For instance, for a `HardSoftScore` and a `ChangeMove` for the computer of a process, there are `optaplanner.solver.move.type.step.score.diff.hard.score` and `optaplanner.solver.move.type.step.score.diff.soft.score` meters with the tag `move.type=ChangeMove(Process.computer)`.
