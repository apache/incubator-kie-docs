= Solving a problem

Use the solver to solve a planning problem.

.Prerequisites
* A `Solver` built from a solver configuration
* An `@PlanningSolution` annotation that represents the planning problem instance

.Procedure
Provide the planning problem as an argument to the `solve()` method. The solver will return the best solution found.

The following example solves the NQueens problem:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
    NQueens problem = ...;
    NQueens bestSolution = solver.solve(problem);
----

In this example, the `solve()` method will return an `NQueens` instance with every `Queen` assigned to a `Row`.

[NOTE]
====
The solution instance given to the `solve(Solution)` method can be partially or fully initialized, which is often the case in repeated planning.

The `solve(Solution)` method can take a long time depending on the problem size and the solver configuration. The `Solver` intelligently works through the search space of possible solutions and remembers the best solution it encounters during solving.
Depending on a number of factors, including problem size, how much time the `Solver` has, the solver configuration, and so forth, the `best` solution might or might not be an `optimal` solution.

[NOTE]
====
The solution instance given to the method `solve(Solution)` is changed by the `Solver`, but do not mistake it for the best solution.

The solution instance returned by the methods `solve(Solution)` or `getBestSolution()` is most likely a planning clone of the instance given to the method `solve(Solution)`, which implies it is a different instance.
