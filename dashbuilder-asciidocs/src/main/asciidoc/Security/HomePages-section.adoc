= Home pages


The home page is the page the user will be redirected after initializing its session.
In order to get the appropriate home page for the user the security subsystem carries out the following tasks: 

. Just after login the security subsystem get the roles of the users and evaluates what workspaces the user is allowed to enter ('__Access__' action granted) 
. Once the list of workspace is calculated then the system selects the workspace identified as default (see workspace properties), if any then get the first in the list. 
. The home page settings are read for the target role and workspace. The system evaluates if the specified home page is visible for the user ('__View__' action granted). If not then the system takes the first visible page from the full list of pages in the workspace. The following screenshot shows the home page configuration screen.
