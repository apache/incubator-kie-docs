= Overview


When we talk about security we refer to the ability to define authorization policies in order to grant or deny users access to a given resource.
Therefore, we first have to define who are the target users and what are the resources we want to protect.
As resources we have the following: 

* **Workspace**: A set of pages with a shared look and feel. It may contain one or more dashboards. 
* **Page**: A combination of panels spread all over the screen and tidy up according to a given layout. A dashboard is basically a page used for monitoring a set of indicators. 
* **Panel**: A reusable and configurable graphical component ready to be embedded and used. f.i: a KPI panel, a tree menu panel or an HTML panel. 


As of users, the application doesn't own a user repository.
Users are managed outside the application.
This means the login itself is delegated to the application server.
After login, the application server pass to the application both the id of the user and the roles he/she has.
The full list of available roles are defined into the application's __WEB-INF/web.xml __file.
