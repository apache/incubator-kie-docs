Below is a screenshot of the permission management screen for a given workspace:

The list of allowed actions are:

* **Access**: login into the application. 
* **Administrate**: access to the toolbar and hence to the whole system configuration features. 
* *Create pages*
* **Edit**: change the workspace properties. 
* **Clear**: ability to delete the workspace. 
* **Edit permissions**: ability to grant/deny permissions. 
* **Change allowed panels**: restrict the type of panels that can be used in this workspace. 


To assign a permission you must select the target role and the list of actions allowed over the selected resource. 

* __Target roles (who__): What user will be granted/denied with the permissions defined. 
* __Allowed actions__: depending on the type of the resource we can enable/disable what the user can do on this resource. 
* __Reverse (optional)__: very useful when we have a set of roles and we want to grant/deny a permission to all the roles but one. 


The above description is the common way to specify a permission regardless of its type.
It applies to the definition of permissions for workspaces, pages and panels. 

As you can see in the previous figure, the system grants by default the full set of permissions to the role '__admin__'. That way it becomes very easy to create a user that can do everything as long as the role admin is assigned.
