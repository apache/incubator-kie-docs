Let's see next how to define custom authorization policies to grant/deny access to a workspaces, pages or panels instances per role. 

include::Security/WorkspacePermissions-section.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
include::Security/PagePermissions-section.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
include::Security/PanelPermissions-section.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
include::Security/HomePages-section.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

To wrap up, it's worth to mention that thanks to the permission system we can build a workspace 
structure with several pages, menus and panels and start defining what pages and panels within a 
page will be visible for each role.  We can also define special kind of users and give them 
restricted access to certain tooling features or even restricted access to a page subset.
The possibilities here are infinite.
