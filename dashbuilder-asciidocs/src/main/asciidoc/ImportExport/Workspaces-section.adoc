= Workspaces

Workspace import & export allows you to move one or more workspaces to other _JBoss Dashbuilder_ installations. 

The import & export of a given workspace implies moving: 

* **Envelope**: The envelope currently used by the workspace.
* **Sections**: All the sections that compose the workspace.
* **Panels**: All the panels used in the workspace sections.


In order to *export a workspace* there exists a panel named __Export workspaces__. 

It lists all the existing workspaces in the application and allows to export one or more workspace definitions in a single XML file.
Note that for versions previous to 6.2.0 the workspaces were exported in ZIP format.

You can *import a workspace* in two ways: 

* Using the __Web User Interface__.
+ 
It allows uploading a XML file that contain one or more workspace definitions.
A ZIP file containing some workspace definitions in XML format is allowed too for backwards compatibility.

* Using the __Deployment Scanner__.
+ 
Just by dropping the workspace definition files into the folder __WEB-INF/deployments__.
Once application is starting, it scans the deployments folder and imports all the workspaces found.
+ 
Some important notes about automatic workspace import using the __deployment scanner__:

** Workspaces are imported once and only at deploy time, not during application runtime
** The XML workspace definition file must have extension __workspace__. Eg: my-workspace.workspace
** If the workspace to import already exists (same workspace logic identifier), it will be overwritten.
** You can overwrite existing workspaces by adding a workspace definition file in the deployment folder with a different name that the initial one. For example, initially you deploy a _my-workspace.workspace_ file into the system, which contains a workspace with _my-workspace_ as identifier. Then if you want to overwrite it, you can place a new file in the deployment folder named _my-workspace-v2.workspace_ using same _my-workspace_ identifier.
