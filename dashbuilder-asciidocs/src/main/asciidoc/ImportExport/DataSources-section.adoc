= Data sources


Data source import & export allows you to import one or more data source connection definitions into a _JBoss Dashbuilder_ installation. 

Data source export is not supported yet, there is no panel for exporting them. 

In order to *import a data source* you can do it in two ways: 

* Manually using the __Web User Interface__.
+ 
Data source definitions consist of few attributes, so an option is to create them in your target environment manually by using the _Data source manager_ panel.

* Using the __Deployment Scanner__.
+ 
Just by dropping the data source definition files into the folder __WEB-INF/deployments__.
On startup the application scans the deployments folder and import all the workspaces it finds.
+ 
Data source definition files are property files with the following supported properties:

** Common properties for all kind of data sources.
*** __type__: The type of the data source. It can be _JNDI_ or __JDBC__.
*** __name__: The data source name.
*** __testQuery__: Defines a query for testing the data source when instantiated.
** Properties for a _JDBC_ data source.
*** __jdbcUrl__: The JDBC URL for the connection.
*** __driverClass__: The fully qualified class name of the driver to use.
*** __user__: The connection username.
*** __password__: The connection password.

Some important notes about automatic data source import using the __deployment scanner__:
** Data sources are imported once and only at deploy time, not during application runtime
** The properties data source definition file must have extension __datasource__. Eg: my-datasource.datasource
** If the data source definition to import already exist (same name), it will be overwritten.
** You can overwrite existing data sources by adding a new definition file in the deployment folder with a different name that the initial one. For example, initially you deploy a _my-datasource.datasource_ file into the system, which contains a data source with _my-datasource_ as name. Then if you want to overwrite it, you can place a new file in the deployment folder named _my-datasource-v2.datasource_ using same _my-datasource_ identifier.
