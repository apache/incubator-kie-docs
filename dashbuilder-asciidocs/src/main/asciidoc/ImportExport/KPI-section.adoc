Dashboard import & export allows you to move your _KPI_ and its _data providers_ to other _JBoss Dashbuilder_ installations. 

The import & export of a given KPI implies moving: 

* **KPI definition**: The type of KPI, its columns and its display configuration.
* **Data provider**: The data provider definition that is used in the KPI.


In order to *export a KPI* there is a panel named __Export dashboards__. 

It lists all the existing KPIs in the application and allows you to export one or more KPI definitions in a single XML file.

You can *import a KPI* in two ways: 

* Using the __Web User Interface__.
+ 
It allows uploading a XML file that contains one or more KPI definitions.

* Using the __Deployment Scanner__. 
+ 
Just by dropping the exported KPI definition files into the folder __WEB-INF/deployments__.
Once the application starts, it will scan the deployment folder and will import all the KPIs files found.
+ 
Some important notes about automatic KPI import using the __Deployment Scanner__:

** KPI and data providers are imported once and only at deploy time, not during application runtime
** The XML KPI definition file must have the extension __kpis__. Eg: my-kpis.kpis
** If the KPI or data provider definitions to import already exist (same logic identifier), they will be overwritten.
** You can overwrite existing KPI or data provider by adding a new definition file in the deployment folder with a different name that the initial one. For example, initially you deploy a _my-kpi.kpis_ file into the system, which contains a KPI with _my-kpi_ as identifier. Then if you want to overwrite it, you can place a new file in the deployment folder named _my-kpi-v2.kpis_ using same _my-kpi_ identifier.
