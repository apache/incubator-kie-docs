= Configuring filter and drill-down


The '__Filter & Drill-down__' panel allows for the quick definition of dynamic forms that will allow us to navigate troughout the data displayed by the dashboard.
Once an instance of the '__Filter & Drill-down__' panel is dropped on the oage we just have to select the '__Edit content__' option from the panel menu.
After that, a popup window similar to the following will be displayed: 

.Filter panel configuration

This is a filter configuration panel where we can set the filter behaviour.
Let's focus first on the middle bottom part of the screen: the __Data provider's property table__, which lists the properties of ALL the data providers referred by the KPIs on the page.
For example, if we are building a sales dashboard and all its KPIs are built on top of the same data provider called '__Sales dasboard
      demo__' then the system lists all the ___data
      properties of the '__Sales dashboard demo
    _ ' provider.
Hence, only the properties we select as '__Visible__' will be part of the filter form.
Aditionally, we can enable the drill-down feature for each property.
If enabled then the system will redirect to the target page when the property is selected on the filter form.
Below is an screenshot of the filter panel of the '__Sales dashboard
      demo__'.

As you can see the form is composed by all the visible properties selected.
For each property the system reads its configuration by asking the underlying data provider.
For label type properties a drop-down list is displayed, containing as options all the disctinct values of the data provider's column.
When the user submits a change on the filter form then the following operations are carried out by the dashboard visualization engine: 

. It reads the data sets for the target data providers. A data provider is in the target set if it contains the selected filter property. 
. It applies a filtering algorithm in memory on the target data.
. If drill-down is enabled for the selected property then the target page is set as current and the steps #1 and #2 are repeated again. 
. Finally, after filtering, all the sensible KPIs are updated in order to display the filtered data. By sensible, we mean a KPI which is displaying data that is being filtered.
