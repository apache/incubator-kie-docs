= Composing a dashboard


A dashboard is basically a page with some KPIs placed on it (plus some other additional widgets as we will see later on). There are two different ways of creating a page: 

Starting as a blank page:

Duplicating an existing page:

You will find these icons at the top of the page, in the administration bar:

To create a new page, click on the '__Create new page__' icon:

A form will be shown to fill in some parameters:

.Page creation form

* *Page title.*
* *Parent page:* Pages are organized in a hierarchical way. This is the parent page. 
* *Skin:* This will select and specific look'n'feel and CSS stylesheet for this page. You can leave the default value. 
* *Envelope:* Defines which kind of HTML template will be placed around the page layout. 
* *Region layout:* This is the template, that is, how regions are organized to place the panels inside the page. We can choose any of the installed types, for example, "Demo - Default template with sliding".

Most of these properties will be discussed in the chapter about '__Customing look'n'feel__'. After creating the page, you might realize the page is still not accessible from the left menu but you can see it in the combo list in the administration toolbar: 

.Brand new empty page

If you want this page to be shown in the left menu, you can click on 'Edit content' and then add the newly created page to the list of options displayed in the menu.

Repeat until the page has all the content and panels required.
After dropping the panels into the right regions and configuring them, you might be able to create dashboards that look like the following one:

As you can see, a dashboard is usually composed by one or more instances of the following panel types: 

* Dashboard > Key Performance Indicator
* Dashboard > Filter & Drill-down
* Navigation > Tree menu
* Navigation > Language menu
* Navigation > Logout panel
