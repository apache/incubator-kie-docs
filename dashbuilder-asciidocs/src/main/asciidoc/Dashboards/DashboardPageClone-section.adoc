= Duplicating a page


As mentioned earlier, another way to create new pages is to copy an existing one.
We can do that via the '__Duplicate current
      page__' icon which is a much faster way to create pages.
After clicking on the clone icon located at the toolbar, a page similar to the image below will be shown.
From there we can select those instances we want to duplicate and those we want to keep as is (to reuse).

Once finished, press the '__Duplicate page__' button and a brand new page will be created with the same name as the original one but starting with the prefix '__Copy of__'. Notice that if a panel instance is reused then any changes made to it will be reflected on all the pages where such instance is being used.
this is a cool feature when we are defining for instance our navigation menus since we can define a single__'Tree menu'__panel and then configure all the pages to display the same menu instance.
