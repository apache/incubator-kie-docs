= How to install and run it


If you want to build the project and execute a quick demo, please, proceed as indicated: 

. Prerequisites:
+ 
This guide assumes you have Java JDK 1.6 (set as JAVA_HOME), a Git client and Maven 3.0.5+ (set as MAVEN_HOME) in your system.
The _java_ and _mvn_ commands must be added to the executable path as well. 
. Download the project from the GitHub server:
+

[source,shell]
----
git clone https://github.com/droolsjbpm/dashboard-builder.git
----
. Open a terminal window, go to the _scripts_ directory and type the following command: 
+

[source,shell]
----
./buildandrun.sh h2
----
+
This command compiles, builds and runs the application.
This procedure will take a few minutes (but only for the first time) because of the Maven build process needs to download a lot of third-party libraries. 
+

[NOTE]
====
The application uses an auto deployable H2 embedded database.
So no extra configuration is needed.
But when you start the application for the first time it may take some minutes due to the database initialization procedure.
The H2 database downgrades the application performance compared with other databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, normally used in production environments 
====
. Once the application is started, open a browser and type the following URL: 
+
[source]
----
http://localhost:8080/dashbuilder
----
+ 
The login screen will appear.
Login as user *root* and password **root**.
You'll gain access to the default workspace, called __Showcase__, which contains several sample dashboards as well as some administrative tools. 
+

+
The following users are available by default:
** **root/root**: to sign-in as the superuser. It's granted with administrative permissions. 
** **demo/demo**: to sign-in as an end user. It has only read only permissions. 

+
You'll need to sing-in as superuser in order to be able to create and modify dashboards.
