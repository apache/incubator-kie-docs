= Creating a KPI


Once the necessary data providers have been created, you can continue by adding a new Key Performance Indicator to an existing page.
All dashboards are created by adding indicators and other types of panels to pages.
A dashboard is a page with a mixture of different kind of panels placed into it.
The following screenshot shows an example of a __Sales Dashboard__:

Pages can be created from scratch, or duplicating an existing one.
Both options are explained in the following sections.
Meanwhile we will assume the page already exists and we only want to add an indicator.

Indicators are a special type of panels, which are the widgets that can be placed within the page.
To add a panel or indicator just click on the toolbar icon '__Add panel to the current page__':

This will make a popup be shown with all the available panels:

To add a new '__Key Performance Indicator__', click on__Dashboard > Key Perfomance Indicator__.
Drag the '__Create panel__' option and drop it into any of the page regions.
You will see that they are being highlighted while you move the mouse over them, then simply drop the panel.

Once dropped, the first step is to select the _Data
      Provider
    _ you need to use, as configured before, to feed the charts and reports with data.
Select any of the data providers and then you can start creating a new indicator.

Now, you must see the chart edition panel.
It's an intuitive environment which helps you configure different type of charts and reports...

* **Domain (X Axis)**: The data column that is taken as the X axis. In this example, we choose the property 'Country'. 
* **Range (Y Axis)**: Information to be grouped and aggregated for every domain interval. For example: 'Amount'. 
* **Renderer**: The rendering library to use. Each one provides different features and visualization style. By default 'NVD3'. 
* **Sort intervals by**: It's how the domain values can be sorted, for example, according to its range value. 
* **Sort order**: It can be ascending or descending. 


To finish the panel edition just close the panel edition window.
If you want to get back again, just click on the right upper corner of the panel area and select the '__Edit content__' menu option.

The system provides you with 3 types of chart displayers: **bar**, *pie* and **line**, and a special *table displayer
    * very useful to create tabular reports.
The system also comes with 2 rendering engines: *NVD3
    * (pure HTML5/SVG technology) and a Flash based one, **Open Flash Chart 2**.
Each renderer has its own available features, so depending on the type of chart and renderer choosen you can end up with some display features enabled or disabled depending the case.
For instance, the '__Paint area__' feature is not available for OFC2 line charts.
