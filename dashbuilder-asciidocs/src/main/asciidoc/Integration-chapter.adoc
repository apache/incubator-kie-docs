= Integration with external systems

Despite Dashbuilder is an standalone dashboard composition tooling, integration with external systems might be required.
For instance: 

* Imagine a third-party web app which relies on Dashbuilder to provide the monitoring capabilities. The web app requires to embed a chart into one of its pages. This would be an example of content syndication. 
* Imagine also another application which want to push/pull data from Dashbuilder. A SAP system, for instance, which want to push a new purchase order to an specific Dashbuilder data provider, or a external alert management system which requires to evaluate the current value for a given KPI. 


These and many others are examples of integration uses cases.
This chapter walks through the different mechanisms that Dashbuilder provides in that direction.
