= Retrieving data from a CSV file


Click on '__Create new data provider__'. The following fields will be shown in the form, with some sensible defaults: 

* Type: in this case - choose the CSV File
* Name: Write the name you want to give to our data provider (this field is multi-language). 
* CSV file URL: Here write the URL where oyur CSV file is located. 
+ 
As an example you can grab the CSV file used by the Sales Dashboard, just copy & paste the following URL: 
+ 
https://raw.github.com/droolsjbpm/dashboard-builder/master/modules/dashboard-samples/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/etc/appdata/initialData/expenseReports.csv

* Data separator: Left as is.
* Quoting symbol: Left as is.
* Date format: Where we can define different date formats or even hour. 
* Number format: Where we can define the number format.


Once you have filled all the fields, click on 'Try', to check that everything works properly.
The application will give you a message '__Correct data set ..__.' and we continue by pressing '__Save__'.

Next, a screen is shown with all the fields found after parsing the file, giving us the option to change the name of each field.
For numeric fields it gives us the option to specify if we want numeric values to be treated as labels by the dashboard engine.
This is something really useful when dealing with numbers which actually behave as labels, f.i: the numeric reference code of a product item.
