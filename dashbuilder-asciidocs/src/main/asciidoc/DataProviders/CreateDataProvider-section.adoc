= Creating a data provider


The first thing to do, after you have accessed the web application, is to create a **data provider**.
On the left menu, go to __'Administration > Data providers__' and once there, select the option '__Create new data
      provider__'. 

The purpose of data providers is to gather information from any system, either a database, a file or any other, and transform it to the internal in-memory representation for building dashboards.
As you may guess there exists different data sources and therefore different ways to retrieve as we're going to see next.
