// Purpose statement for the assembly

As a developer, you can use {CENTRAL} to configure {PRODUCT} assets for case management.

Case management differs from Business Process Management (BPM). It focuses more on the actual data being handled throughout the case rather than on the sequence of steps taken to complete a goal. Case data is the most important piece of information in automated case handling, while business context and decision-making are in the hands of the human case worker.

//<MH>Dev, in viewing the IT_Orders case project in 7.6, I see that the case definitions are actually referred to as business processes when viewing the sample assets. Should we consider a change in the naming of the assets moving forward to avoid confusion. We are using the term "Case definition" as if it will be listed somewhere.</MH>

//Per KrisV: Case definitions are like normal business processes, so that's why they are listed as such in the asset list. The difference is that if you create a case definition, it creates a business process where the dynamic property is already set to true.

{PRODUCT} includes the *IT_Orders* sample project in {CENTRAL}. This document refers to the sample project to explain case management concepts and provide examples.

The {URL_GETTING_STARTED}#assembly-getting-started-case-management[_{GETTING_STARTED_CASES}_] tutorial describes how to create and test a new IT_Orders project in {CENTRAL}. After reviewing the concepts in this guide, follow the procedures in the tutorial to ensure that you are able to successfully create, deploy, and test your own case project.

.Prerequisites
* {EAP_LONG} {EAP_VERSION} is installed. For information about installing {EAP_LONG} {EAP_VERSION}, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_enterprise_application_platform/{EAP_VERSION}/html-single/installation_guide/[_{EAP_LONG} {EAP_VERSION} Installation Guide_].
* {PRODUCT} is installed. For information about installing {PRODUCT}, see {URL_INSTALLING_AND_CONFIGURING}#assembly-planning[_{PLANNING_INSTALL}_].
* {PRODUCT} is running and you can log in to {CENTRAL} with the `user` role. For information about users and permissions, see {URL_INSTALLING_AND_CONFIGURING}#assembly-planning[_{PLANNING_INSTALL}_].
* The Showcase application is deployed. For information about how to install and log in to the Showcase application, see {URL_DEVELOPING_PROCESS_SERVICES}#assembly-showcase-application[_{SHOWCASE_APPLICATION_CASE_MANAGEMENT}_].
