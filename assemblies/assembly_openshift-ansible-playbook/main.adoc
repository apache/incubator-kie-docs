// Purpose statement for the assembly
As a system engineer, you can deploy a {PRODUCT} environment on {OPENSHIFT} to provide an infrastructure to develop or execute processes and other business assets. You can use the Automation Broker to deploy the environment in an interactive process, setting all
parameters as necessary. A {PRODUCT} Ansible Playbook for the Automation Broker is available.

.Prerequisites

* At least four gigabytes of memory are available in the OpenShift environment.
* The OpenShift Ansible Broker is installed and started in the OpenShift environment.
* The OpenShift project for the deployment has been created.
* You are logged in to the project using the OpenShift web console and using the `oc` command.
** Administrator access is required if {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} image streams are not already available in the OpenShift enfironment.
* Dynamic persistent volume (PV) provisioning is enabled. Alternatively, if dynamic PV provisioning is not enabled,  enough persistent volumes must be available. By default, the following sizes are required:
** Each deployed replicated set of {KIE_SERVER} pods, by default, requires one 1Gi PV for the database. You can change the database PV size in the playbook parameters. You can deploy multiple immutable servers; each requires a separate database PV. This requirement does not apply if you use an external database server.
** By default, {CENTRAL} requires one 1Gi PV. You can change the PV size for {CENTRAL} persistent storage in the playbook parameters.
** {CENTRAL} Monitoring requires one 64Mi PV.
** Smart Router requires one 64Mi PV.
* If you intend to scale any of the {CENTRAL} or {CENTRAL} Monitoring pods, your OpenShift environment supports persistent volumes with `ReadWriteMany` mode.

[IMPORTANT]
====
`ReadWriteMany` mode is not supported on OpenShift Online and OpenShift Dedicated.
