// Purpose statement for the assembly
As a business analyst, systems administrator, or business rules developer, the types of {PRODUCT} business assets that you create and the way in which you develop, store, execute, and deploy those assets varies based on the needs of your business automation environment. You can design a decision management architecture that uses {CENTRAL} or an external integrated development environment (IDE) for asset development, a built-in or external Git repository for storage and version control, a {KIE_SERVER} or embedded application for deployment, or other implementation combinations. You can also deploy {PRODUCT} into a {OPENSHIFT} environment for an enhanced containerized implementation.

This document describes basic concepts and options for a {PRODUCT} implementation to consider when designing your decision management architecture. To verify the most suitable implementation for your environment, contact your Red Hat Technical Account Manager or Solutions Architect.
