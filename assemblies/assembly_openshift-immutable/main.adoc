// Purpose statement for the assembly
As a system engineer, you can deploy a {PRODUCT} immutable server environment on {OPENSHIFT}
to provide an infrastructure to execute
ifdef::DM[]
services
endif::DM[]
ifdef::PAM[]
services, process applications,
endif::PAM[]
and other business assets. You can use
standard integration tools to manage the immutable {KIE_SERVER} image. You can create new server images
to add and update the business assets.

.Prerequisites

* {OPENSHIFT} version 3.11 is deployed.
ifdef::PAM[]
* At least four gigabytes of memory are available in the OpenShift cluster/namespace.
** If you do not deploy monitoring infrastructure but only deploy an immutable {KIE_SERVER}, three gigabytes can be sufficient.
endif::PAM[]
ifdef::DM[]
* At least two gigabytes of memory are available in the OpenShift cluster/namespace.
endif::DM[]
* The OpenShift project for the deployment has been created.
* You are logged in to the project using the `oc` command. For more information about the `oc` command-line tool, see the OpenShift https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/3.11/html-single/cli_reference/[CLI Reference]. If you want to use the OpenShift Web console to deploy templates, you must also be logged on using the Web console.
ifdef::PAM[]
* Dynamic persistent volume (PV) provisioning is enabled. Alternatively, if dynamic PV provisioning is not enabled, enough persistent volumes must be available. By default, the following sizes are required:
** Each immutable server deployment includes a replicated set of {KIE_SERVER} pods, which, by default, requires one 1Gi PV for the database. You can change the database PV size in the template parameters. You can deploy multiple immutable servers; each requires a separate database PV. This requirement does not apply if you use an external database server.
** If you deploy the immutable monitoring template, two 64Mi PVs are also required (one for {CENTRAL} Monitoring and one for Smart Router).
* If you intend to deploy the immutable monitoring template, your OpenShift environment supports persistent volumes with `ReadWriteMany` mode. If your environment does not support this mode, you can use NFS to provision the volumes. For information about access mode support in OpenShift Online volume plug-ins, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/3.11/html-single/architecture/#pv-access-modes[Access Modes].

[IMPORTANT]
====
`ReadWriteMany` mode is not supported on OpenShift Online and OpenShift Dedicated.

[NOTE]
====
Since {PRODUCT} version 7.5, support for {OPENSHIFT} 3.x is deprecated, including installation using all templates and using the Automation Broker (Ansible Playbook). New features might not be added, and this functionality will be removed in a future release.
