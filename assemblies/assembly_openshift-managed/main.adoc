// Purpose statement for the assembly
As a system engineer, you can deploy a {PRODUCT} managed server environment on {OPENSHIFT}
to provide an infrastructure to execute
ifdef::DM[]
services
endif::DM[]
ifdef::PAM[]
services, process applications,
endif::PAM[]
and other business assets. You can use
{CENTRAL} Monitoring to manage and update the processes running on {KIE_SERVERS} in this environment.

.Prerequisites

* At least four gigabytes of memory are available in the OpenShift cluster/namespace.
* The OpenShift project for the deployment has been created.
* You are logged in to the project using the `oc` command. For more information about the `oc` command-line tool, see the OpenShift https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/3.11/html-single/cli_reference/[CLI Reference]. If you want to use the OpenShift Web console to deploy templates, you must also be logged on using the Web console.
* Dynamic persistent volume (PV) provisioning is enabled. Alternatively, if dynamic PV provisioning is not enabled, enough persistent volumes must be available. By default, the following sizes are required:
** Each deployed replicated set of {KIE_SERVER} pods requires, by default, one 1Gi PV for the database. You can change the database PV size in the template parameters. This requirement does not apply if you use an external database server.
** {CENTRAL} Monitoring requires one 64Mi PV.
** Smart Router requires one 64Mi PV.
* Your OpenShift environment supports persistent volumes with `ReadWriteMany` mode. For information about access mode support in OpenShift Online volume plug-ins, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/3.11/html-single/architecture/#pv-access-modes[Access Modes].

[IMPORTANT]
====
`ReadWriteMany` mode is not supported on OpenShift Online and OpenShift Dedicated.
