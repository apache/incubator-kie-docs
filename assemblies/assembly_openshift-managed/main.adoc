// Purpose statement for the assembly
As a system engineer, you can deploy a {PRODUCT} managed server environment on {OPENSHIFT}
to provide an infrastructure to execute
ifdef::DM[]
services
endif::DM[]
ifdef::PAM[]
services, process applications,
endif::PAM[]
and other business assets. You can use
{CENTRAL} Monitoring to manage and update the processes running on {KIE_SERVERS} in this environment.

.Prerequisites

* At least four gigabytes of memory must be available in the OpenShift cluster/namespace.
* The OpenShift project for the deployment must be created.
* You must be logged in to the project using the `oc` command. For more information about the `oc` command-line tool, see the OpenShift https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/3.11/html-single/cli_reference/[CLI Reference]. If you want to use the OpenShift Web console to deploy templates, you must also be logged on using the Web console.
* Dynamic persistent volume (PV) provisioning mustbe enabled. Alternatively, if dynamic PV provisioning is not enabled, enough persistent volumes must be available. By default, the following sizes are required:
** Each deployed replicated set of {KIE_SERVER} pods requires, by default, one 1Gi PV for the database. You can change the database PV size in the template parameters. This requirement does not apply if you use an external database server.
** {CENTRAL} Monitoring requires one 64Mi PV.
** Smart Router requires one 64Mi PV.
* If you intend to scale any of the {CENTRAL} Monitoring pods, your OpenShift environment supports persistent volumes with ReadWriteMany mode. For information about access mode support in OpenShift Online volume plug-ins, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/3.11/html-single/architecture/#pv-access-modes[Access Modes].
