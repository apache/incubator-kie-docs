// Purpose statement for the assembly
As a business rules developer, you can test and interact with the {PLANNER} functionality using the preconfigured `employee-rostering` sample project included in the {PRODUCT} distribution.

The `employee-rostering` sample project can be built and deployed in {CENTRAL}. The project is designed to demonstrate how to create each of the {CENTRAL} assets required to solve the shift rostering planning problem and use {PLANNER} to find the best possible solution. Use this document to deploy the preconfigured `employee-rostering` project in {CENTRAL}, or to create the project yourself using {CENTRAL}.

[NOTE]
====
The `employee-rostering` sample project in {CENTRAL} does not include a data set.
