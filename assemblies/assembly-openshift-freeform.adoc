= Deploying a {PRODUCT} freeform managed server environment on {OPENSHIFT}
ifdef::context[:parent-context: {context}]
// Context attribute is assembly specific and enables module reuse between assemblies.

// Purpose statement for the assembly
As a system engineer, you can deploy a {PRODUCT} freeform managed server environment on {OPENSHIFT}
to provide an infrastructure to execute
services, process applications,
and other business assets. You can deploy any number of managed {KIE_SERVERS} and control them using the same {CENTRAL} Monitoring. You can add and remove the {KIE_SERVERS} as necessary; {CENTRAL} Monitoring establishes a connection to them automatically. You can also use the same {CENTRAL} Monitoring instance to monitor immutable {KIE_SERVERS}.

.Prerequisites

* {OPENSHIFT} version 3.11 is deployed.
* At least four gigabytes of memory are available in the OpenShift cluster/namespace.
* The OpenShift project for the deployment is created.
* You are logged in to the project using the `oc` command. For more information about the `oc` command-line tool, see the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/3.11/html-single/cli_reference/[OpenShift Container Platform CLI Reference]. If you want to use the OpenShift Web console to deploy templates, you must also be logged on using the Web console.
ifdef::PAM[]
* Dynamic persistent volume (PV) provisioning is enabled. Alternatively, if dynamic PV provisioning is not enabled, enough persistent volumes must be available. By default, the deployed components require the following PV sizes:
** {Central} Monitoring requires a 64Mi PV.
** Each {KIE_SERVER} deployment by default requires one 1Gi PV for the database. You can change the database PV size in the template parameters. If you deploy multiple separate {KIE_SERVERS}, each of the servers requires a separate database PV. This requirement does not apply if you use an external database server.
* Your OpenShift environment supports persistent volumes with `ReadWriteMany` mode. If your environment does not support this mode, you can use NFS to provision the volumes. For information about access mode support in OpenShift public and dedicated clouds, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/3.11/html-single/architecture/#pv-access-modes[Access Modes].

[NOTE]
====
Since {PRODUCT} version 7.5, images and templates for {OPENSHIFT} 3.x are deprecated. These images and templates do not get new features, but remain supported until the end of full support for {OPENSHIFT} version 3.x. For more information about the full support lifecycle phase for {OPENSHIFT} version 3.x, see https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift_noncurrent[Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Life Cycle Policy (non-current versions)].

[NOTE]
====
Do not use {PRODUCT} templates with {OPENSHIFT} 4.x. To deploy {PRODUCT} on {OPENSHIFT} 4.x, see the instructions in {URL_DEPLOYING_ON_OPENSHIFT}#assembly-openshift-operator[_{DEPLOYING_OPENSHIFT_OPERATOR}_].
