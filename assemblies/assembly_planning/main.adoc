{PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} is available for the following application platforms:

* {EAP}
* Red Hat JBoss Web Server
* Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
* Oracle WebLogic Server
* IBM WebSphere Application Server

=== {EAP} {EAP_VERSION}
{EAP_LONG} ({EAP}) {EAP_VERSION} is a certified implementation of the Java Enterprise Edition 7 (Java EE 7) full and web profile specifications. Red Hat JBoss EAP provides preconfigured options for features such as high availability, clustering, messaging, and distributed caching. It also enables users to write, deploy, and run applications using the various APIs and services that Red Hat JBoss EAP provides.

You can install both {CENTRAL} and {KIE_SERVER} in a single {EAP} instance. However, in production environments you should install them in separate instances.

=== Red Hat JBoss Web Server
Red Hat JBoss Web Server is an enterprise-ready web server designed for medium and large applications, based on Tomcat. Red Hat JBoss Web Server provides organizations with a single deployment platform for Java Server Pages (JSP) and Java Servlet technologies, PHP, and CGI.

You can install {KIE_SERVER} and the {HEADLESS_CONTROLLER} on Red Hat Web Server 5.1.0.

=== Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (OpenShift) combines Docker and Kubernetes, and provides an API to manage these services. OpenShift Container Platform enables you to create and manage containers.

In this solution, components of {PRODUCT} are deployed as separate OpenShift pods. You can scale each of the pods up and down individually, providing as few or as many containers as necessary for a particular component. You can use standard OpenShift methods to manage the pods and balance the load.

You can install both {CENTRAL} and {KIE_SERVER} on OpenShift.

//=== JBoss Web Server 5

=== Oracle WebLogic Server
Oracle WebLogic Server is a Java EE application server that provides a standard set of APIs for creating distributed Java applications that can access a wide variety of services, such as databases, messaging services, and connections to external enterprise systems. Users access these applications using web browser clients or Java clients.

You can install {KIE_SERVER} in an Oracle Weblogic Server instance and then use the {HEADLESS_CONTROLLER} and the REST API or the {KIE_SERVER} Java Client API to interact with {KIE_SERVER}. You can also use standalone {CENTRAL} to interact with {KIE_SERVER}.


=== IBM WebSphere Application Server
IBM WebSphere Application Server is a flexible and secure web application server that hosts Java-based web applications and provides Java EE-certified run time environments. IBM WebSphere 9.0 supports Java SE 8 and is fully compliant with Java EE 7 since version 8.5.5.6.

You can install {KIE_SERVER} in an IBM WebSphere Application Server instance and then use the {HEADLESS_CONTROLLER} to interact with {KIE_SERVER}. You can also use standalone {CENTRAL} to interact with {KIE_SERVER}.

=== Development options
Developers can develop assets in {PRODUCT}. However, you can optionally integrate Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio with Red Hat {PRODUCT_SHORT} to enable developers to write complex applications and leverage code auto-completion.

Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) based on Eclipse. It integrates tooling and runtime components by combining Eclipse, Eclipse Tooling, and Red Hat JBoss EAP. Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio provides plug-ins with tools and interfaces for {PRODUCT}. These plug-ins are based on the community version of these products.
ifdef::PAM[]
For this reason, the {PRODUCT} plug-ins are called the jBPM and Drools plug-ins.
endif::[]
ifdef::DM[]
For this reason, the {PRODUCT} plug-in is called the Drools plug-in.
endif::[]


== Supported repositories
=== Git repositories
Git repositories are used internally within {CENTRAL} to store all processes, rules, and other artifacts that are created in the authoring environment. Git is a distributed version control system. It implements revisions as commit objects. When you commit your changes into a repository, a new commit object in the Git repository is created. When you create a project in {CENTRAL} it is added to the Git repository connected to {CENTRAL}.

If you have projects in other Git repositories, you can import them into {CENTRAL} spaces. You can use Git hooks to synchronize the internal Git repositories with external repositories.

== Integrating with Red Hat Single Sign-On
Red Hat Single Sign-On (RH-SSO) is a single sign-on solution that you can use to secure your browser applications with your REST web services and Git access.

When you integrate {PRODUCT} with RH-SSO, you create an SSO and identity management (IDM) environment for {PRODUCT}. The session management feature of RH-SSO enables you to use a single authentication for different {PRODUCT} environments on the internet.

RH-SSO 7.3 is supported with {PRODUCT} on {EAP} {EAP_VERSION}.
