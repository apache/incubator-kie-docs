// Purpose statement for the assembly

As a developer you can use case management to create unpredictable and ad hoc case processes. A case worker or process administrator will focus on case management and execution.

This document will familiarize you with the concepts of case management by showing you how to create and deploy a new IT order project. Before you create the new project, you will review the existing *IT_Orders* sample project in {CENTRAL} for reference. Additionally, you will use the Case management Showcase application, which is included in the {PRODUCT} to demonstrate the capabilities of case management.
