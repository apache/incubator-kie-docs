// Purpose statement for the assembly
As a system engineer, you can deploy a {PRODUCT} freeform server environment on {OPENSHIFT}
to provide an infrastructure to execute
services, process applications,
and other business assets. You can deploy any number of managed and immutable {KIE_SERVERS} and control them using the same {CENTRAL} Monitoring. You can add and remove the {KIE_SERVERS} as necessary; {CENTRAL} Monitoring establishes a connection to them automatically.

.Prerequisites

* At least four gigabytes of memory are available in the OpenShift cluster/namespace.
* The OpenShift project for the deployment has been created.
* You are logged in to the project using the `oc` command. For more information about the `oc` command-line tool, see the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/3.11/html-single/cli_reference/[OpenShift Container Platform CLI Reference]. If you want to use the OpenShift Web console to deploy templates, you must also be logged on using the Web console.
ifdef::PAM[]
* Dynamic persistent volume (PV) provisioning is enabled. Alternatively, if dynamic PV provisioning is not enabled, enough persistent volumes must be available. By default, the following sizes are required:
** {Central} Monitoring requires a 64Mi PV.
** Each {KIE_SERVER} deployment by default requires one 1Gi PV for the database. You can change the database PV size in the template parameters. If you deploy multiple separate {KIE_SERVERS}, each of the servers requires a separate database PV. This requirement does not apply if you use an external database server.
* Your OpenShift environment supports persistent volumes with ReadWriteMany mode. For information about access mode support in OpenShift Online volume plug-ins, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/3.11/html-single/architecture/#pv-access-modes[Access Modes].
