// Purpose statement for the assembly
As a system engineer, you can deploy a {PRODUCT} freeform server environment on {OPENSHIFT}
to provide an infrastructure to execute
services, process applications,
and other business assets. You can deploy any number of managed and immutable {KIE_SERVERS} and control them using the same {CENTRAL} Monitoring. You can add and remove the {KIE_SERVERS} as necessary; {CENTRAL} Monitoring establishes a connection to them automatically.

.Prerequisites

* At least four gigabytes of memory must be available in the OpenShift cluster/namespace.
* The OpenShift project for the deployment must be created.
* You must be logged in to the project using the `oc` command. For more information about the `oc` command-line tool, see the OpenShift https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/3.11/html-single/cli_reference/[CLI Reference]. If you want to use the OpenShift Web console to deploy templates, you must also be logged on using the Web console.
ifdef::PAM[]
* Dynamic persistent volume (PV) provisioning must be enabled. Alternatively, if dynamic PV provisioning is not enabled, enough persistent volumes must be available. By default, the following sizes are required:
** Each {KIE_SERVER} deployment includes a replicated set of {KIE_SERVER} pods, which by default requires one 1Gi PV for the database. You can change the database PV size in the template parameters. You can deploy multiple immutable servers; each requires a separate database PV. This requirement does not apply if you use an external database server.
** If you deploy the monitoring template, two 64Mi PVs are also required (one for {CENTRAL} Monitoring and one for Smart Router).
