// Purpose statement for the assembly
As a business rules and processes developer, you can use {CENTRAL} in {PRODUCT} or the {PRODUCT} BPMN modeler in VSCode to design business processes to meet specific business requirements. {PRODUCT} provides sample projects in {CENTRAL} that contain business assets for reference purposes. This document describes how to create a new mortgage process project, data objects, and business process to familiarize yourself with {CENTRAL} and the process designer.

You will then refer to the *Mortgage_Process* sample project included in {CENTRAL} to review the sample project's business rules, decision tables, and forms. You will build and deploy the *Mortgage_Process* sample project and execute the project's defined functionality.
