// Purpose statement for the assembly
As a developer of business processes, you can use {PRODUCT} business automation to develop process services using Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) 2.0 process models. BPMN process models are graphical representations of the steps required to achieve a business goal. You can design your BPMN processes with the {PRODUCT} BPMN modeler in VSCode or import existing BPMN processes into your {PRODUCT} projects for deployment and execution.

For more information about BPMN, see the Object Management Group (OMG) https://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0/About-BPMN[Business Process Model and Notation 2.0 specification].

[IMPORTANT]
====
{PRODUCT} is currently available for Development Preview. Development Preview releases contain features and APIs that might not be fully tested and that might change in the final GA version. Users are discouraged from using Development Preview software in production or for business-critical workloads.  Because this is not production-ready software, users are not able to open support tickets. To learn more about {PRODUCT}, please contact your Red Hat representative or send an email to Kogito-earlyaccess@redhat.com. Red Hat will address reported issues at its own discretion.
