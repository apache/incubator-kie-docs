// Purpose statement for the assembly
As a developer of business processes and decisions, you can deploy {PRODUCT} services on {OPENSHIFT} for cloud implementation. The {PRODUCT} Operator automates many of the deployment steps for you or guides you through the deployment process. You can use the {PRODUCT} command-line interface (CLI) to interact with the {PRODUCT} Operator for deployment tasks.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{PRODUCT} is currently available for Development Preview. Development Preview releases contain features and APIs that might not be fully tested and that might change in the final GA version. Users are discouraged from using Development Preview software in production or for business-critical workloads.  Because this is not production-ready software, users are not able to open support tickets. To learn more about {PRODUCT}, please contact your Red Hat representative or send an email to Kogito-earlyaccess@redhat.com. Red Hat will address reported issues at its own discretion.
====

.Prerequisites
* {OPENSHIFT} 4.3 or later is installed.
* The OpenShift project for the deployment is created.
