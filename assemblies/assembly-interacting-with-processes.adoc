// Context attribute is assembly specific and enables module reuse between assemblies.
:context: interacting-with-processes

// Purpose statement for the assembly
As a knowledge worker, you use {CENTRAL} in {PRODUCT} to run processes and tasks of the business process application developed by citizen developers. A business process is a series of steps that are executed as defined in the process flow. To effectively interact with processes and tasks, you must have a clear understanding of the business process and be able to determine the current step of a process or task. You can start and stop tasks; search and filter tasks and process instances; delegate, claim, and release tasks; set a due date and priority of tasks; view and add comments to tasks; and view the task history log.

.Prerequisites
* {PRODUCT} is installed. For installation options, see {URL_INSTALLING_AND_CONFIGURING}#assembly-planning[_{PLANNING_INSTALL}_].
