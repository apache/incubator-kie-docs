// Purpose statement for the assembly
As a citizen developer who wants to build rule-based solutions quickly, you can use {CENTRAL} in {PRODUCT} to design a variety of business processes. A business process is a graph that describes the order in which a series of steps must be executed using a flow chart.
A process consists of a collection of predefined node types that are linked to each other using connections.
Each of the nodes represents one step in the overall process while the connections specify how to transition from one node to the other.
