// Purpose statement for the assembly
This solution examines the use of Ansible and {PRODUCT} technology in ONAP architecture. It elaborates on how automation and rules management systems together can provide a comprehensive network policy engine. The proposed policy engine is capable of providing the necessary automations for proactive response to network and service conditions without human intervention. The capability of responding to network and service conditions without human intervention is also known as closed loop automation.
