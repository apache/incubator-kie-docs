= Developing decision services with {PRODUCT}
// Context attribute is assembly specific and enables module reuse between assemblies.
:doctype: book
:imagesdir: _images
:context: kogito-developing-decision-services
include::_artifacts/author-group.adoc[]

// Purpose statement for the assembly
As a developer of business decisions, you can use {PRODUCT} business automation to develop decision services using Decision Model and Notation (DMN) models, Drools Rule Language (DRL) rules, XLS or XLSX spreadsheet decision tables, or a combination of all three methods.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{PRODUCT} is currently available for Development Preview. Development Preview releases contain features and APIs that might not be fully tested and that might change in the final GA version. Users are discouraged from using Development Preview software in production or for business-critical workloads.  Because this is not production-ready software, users are not able to open support tickets. To learn more about {PRODUCT}, please contact your Red Hat representative or send an email to Kogito-earlyaccess@redhat.com. Red Hat will address reported issues at its own discretion.

= Using DMN models in {PRODUCT} services
:context: dmn-models

As a developer of business decisions, you can use Decision Model and Notation (DMN) to model a decision service graphically in a decision requirements diagram (DRD). This diagram consists of one or more decision requirements graphs (DRGs) that trace business decisions from start to finish, with each decision node using logic defined in DMN boxed expressions such as decision tables.

{PRODUCT} provides design and runtime support for DMN 1.2 models at conformance level 3, and runtime-only support for DMN 1.1 and 1.3 models at conformance level 3. You can design your DMN models with the {PRODUCT} DMN modeler in VSCode or import existing DMN models into your {PRODUCT} projects for deployment and execution. DMN 1.1 and 1.3 models are currently not supported in the {PRODUCT} DMN modeler.

For more information about DMN, see the Object Management Group (OMG) https://www.omg.org/spec/DMN[Decision Model and Notation specification].

= Using DRL rules in {PRODUCT} services
:context: drl-rules

As a developer of business decisions, you can define business rules using Drools Rule Language (DRL) directly in free-form `.drl` text files. A DRL file can contain one or more rules that define at a minimum the rule conditions (`when`) and actions (`then`).

= Using spreadsheet decision tables in {PRODUCT} services
:context: decision-tables

As a developer of business decisions, you can define business rules in a tabular format in spreadsheet decision tables and then include the spreadsheet file in your {PRODUCT} project. These rules are compiled into Drools Rule Language (DRL) for the decision service in your project.

= Testing decision services using test scenarios in {PRODUCT}
:context: test-scenarios

As a developer of business decisions, you can use test scenarios in {PRODUCT} to test the decision logic in your {PRODUCT} decision services. Test scenarios enable you to ensure that your {PRODUCT} decision services are functioning properly and as expected as you develop your {PRODUCT} project.

IMPORTANT: Test scenarios in {PRODUCT} currently support DMN decision services only. Test scenarios will support Drools Rule Language (DRL) decision services in a future release.

= {DECISION_ENGINE_CAP} in {PRODUCT}
:context: decision-engine

As a developer of business decisions, your understanding of the {DECISION_ENGINE} in {PRODUCT} can help you design more effective business assets and a more scalable decision management architecture. The {DECISION_ENGINE} is the {PRODUCT} component that stores, processes, and evaluates data to execute business rules and to reach the decisions that you define. This document describes basic concepts and functions of the {DECISION_ENGINE} to consider as you create your business rule system and decision services in {PRODUCT}.
