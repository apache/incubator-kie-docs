// Purpose statement for the assembly
As a system engineer, you can deploy a {PRODUCT} authoring environment on {OPENSHIFT} to provide a platform for development of
ifdef::DM[]
services
endif::DM[]
ifdef::PAM[]
services, process applications,
endif::PAM[]
and other business assets.

.Prerequisites

* {OPENSHIFT} version 3.11 is deployed.
* At least four gigabytes of memory are available in the OpenShift cluster/namespace.
* For a high-availability deployment, the following resources are available on the OpenShift cluster:
** For the {CENTRAL} replicated pod, 8 gigabytes of memory and 2 CPU cores are required for each replica. Two replicas are created by default.
** For the {KIE_SERVER} replicated pod, 1 gigabyte of memory and 1 CPU core are required for each replica. Two replicas are created by default.
** For the Red Hat Data Grid replicated pod, 2 gigabytes of memory and 1 CPU core are required for each replica. Two replicas are created by default.
** The Red Hat AMQ replicated pod uses the default resource limits configured on your cluster.
** The MySQL replicated pod uses the default resource limits configured on your cluster.

[NOTE]
====
For instructions about checking the capacity of your cluster, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/3.11/html/cluster_administration/admin-guide-cluster-capacity[Analyzing cluster capacity] in the {OPENSHIFT} 3.11 product documentation.
====

* The OpenShift project for the deployment is created.
* You are logged in to the project using the `oc` command. For more information about the `oc` command-line tool, see the OpenShift https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/3.11/html-single/cli_reference/[CLI Reference]. If you want to use the OpenShift Web console to deploy templates, you must also be logged on using the Web console.
* Dynamic persistent volume (PV) provisioning is enabled. Alternatively, if dynamic PV provisioning is not enabled, enough persistent volumes must be available. By default, the deployed components require the following PV sizes:
** The replicated set of {KIE_SERVER} pods requires one 1Gi PV for the database by default. You can change the database PV size in the template parameters. This requirement does not apply if you use an external database server.
** {CENTRAL} requires one 1Gi PV by default. You can change the PV size for {CENTRAL} persistent storage in the template parameters.
* If you intend to deploy a high-availability authoring environment, which includes high-availability {CENTRAL}, your OpenShift environment supports persistent volumes with `ReadWriteMany` mode. If your environment does not support this mode, you can use NFS to provision the volumes. However, for best performance and reliability, use GlusterFS to provision persistent volumes for a high-availability authoring environment. For information about access mode support in OpenShift public and dedicated clouds, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/3.11/html-single/architecture/#pv-access-modes[Access Modes].

[NOTE]
====
Since {PRODUCT} version 7.5, support for {OPENSHIFT} 3.x is deprecated, including using templates to install {PRODUCT}. This functionality will be removed in a future release. 
====

[NOTE]
====
Do not use {PRODUCT} templates with {OPENSHIFT} 4.x. To deploy {PRODUCT} on {OPENSHIFT} 4.x, see the instructions in {URL_DEPLOYING_OPENSHIFT_OPERATOR}[_{DEPLOYING_OPENSHIFT_OPERATOR}_].
