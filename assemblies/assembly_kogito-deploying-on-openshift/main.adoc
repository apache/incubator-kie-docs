// Purpose statement for the assembly
As a developer of business processes and rules, you can deploy {PRODUCT} services on {OPENSHIFT} for cloud implementation. The {PRODUCT} Operator automates many of the deployment steps for you or guides you through the deployment process. You can use the {PRODUCT} command-line interface (CLI) to interact with the {PRODUCT} Operator for deployment tasks.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{PRODUCT} is currently for Developer Preview only. Developer Preview releases contain features that might not be fully tested and are not in production-ready state. Customers are advised to avoid running the software for production or business-critical workloads. Customers are not able to open support cases against the Developer Preview releases. Red Hat does not commit to fixing any reported issues and the provided features might not be available in future releases.

.Prerequisites
