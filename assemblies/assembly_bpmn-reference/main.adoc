// Purpose statement for the assembly

This Business Process Modeling and Notation (BPMN2) reference document provides an explanation of the BPMN elements in the {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} process designer.
As a process manager, you can refer to this document for a detailed description of BPMN symbols and their uses when designing business or case management processes in {CENTRAL}.

For details about BPMN, see the Business Process Model and Notation, Version 2.0. The BPMN 2.0 specification is an Object Management Group (OMG) specification that defines standards on how to graphically represent a business process, defines execution semantics for the elements along with an XML format of process definitions source. {PRODUCT} focuses exclusively on executable processes and supports a significant subset of the BPMN elements including the most common types that can be used inside executable processes.

A process element is a node of the process definition. The term covers nodes with execution semantics as well as those without. Elements with execution semantics define the execution workflow of the process. 

Elements without execution semantics, such as artifacts, allow users to provide notes and further information on the process or any of its elements to accommodate collaboration of multiple users with different roles, such as business analyst, business manager, or process designer.

All elements with execution semantics define their generic properties.

.Generic Process Element Properties
ID::
The ID defined as a String, unique in the parent KIE base.

Name::
The display name of the element.
