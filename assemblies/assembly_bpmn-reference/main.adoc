// Purpose statement for the assembly

This document provides an explanation of the BPMN2 elements in the {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} legacy and new process designers. As a process manager, you can refer to this document for a detailed description of BPMN2 symbols and their uses when designing business or case management processes in {CENTRAL}. For more details about BPMN2, see the https://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0/About-BPMN[Business Process Model and Notation Version 2.0] specification.

[NOTE]
====
The legacy process designer is deprecated. It will not be updated and will be removed from {PRODUCT} in the next release.

If you import processes created with the legacy process designer into the new process designer, send, receive, and manual tasks are converted to empty tasks and group elements and data object elements are dropped.
