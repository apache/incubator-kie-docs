// Purpose statement for the assembly
As a system engineer, you can deploy a {PRODUCT} authoring or managed environment on {OPENSHIFT} to provide a platform for developing or running
ifdef::DM[]
services
endif::DM[]
ifdef::PAM[]
services, process applications,
endif::PAM[]
and other business assets.

.Prerequisites

* {OPENSHIFT} version 3.11 is deployed.
* At least four gigabytes of memory are available in the OpenShift cluster/namespace.
* For a high-availability deployment, the following resources are available on the OpenShift cluster:
** For the {CENTRAL} replicated pod, 8 gigabytes of memory and 2 CPU cores are required for each replica. Two replicas are created by default.
** For the {KIE_SERVER} replicated pod, 1 gigabyte of memory and 1 CPU core are required for each replica. Two replicas are created by default.
** The Red Hat AMQ replicated pod uses the default resource limits configured on your cluster.
** For the Red Hat Data Grid replicated pod, 2 gigabytes of memory and 1 CPU core are required for each replica. Two replicas are created by default.

[NOTE]
====
For instructions about checking the capacity of your cluster, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/3.11/html/cluster_administration/admin-guide-cluster-capacity[Analyzing cluster capacity] in the {OPENSHIFT} 3.11 product documentation.
====

* The OpenShift project for the deployment is created.
* You are logged in to the project using the `oc` command. For more information about the `oc` command-line tool, see the OpenShift https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/3.11/html-single/cli_reference/[CLI Reference]. If you want to use the OpenShift Web console to deploy templates, you must also be logged on using the Web console.
* Dynamic persistent volume (PV) provisioning is enabled. Alternatively, if dynamic PV provisioning is not enabled, a sufficient persistent volume must be available. By default, {CENTRAL} requires one 1Gi PV. You can change the PV size for {CENTRAL} persistent storage in the template parameters.
* If you intend to deploy a high-availability authoring environment, which includes high-availability {CENTRAL}, your OpenShift environment supports persistent volumes with `ReadWriteMany` mode. If your environment does not support this mode, you can use NFS to provision the volumes. However, for best performance and reliability, use GlusterFS to provision persistent volumes for a high-availability authoring environment. For information about access mode support in OpenShift public and dedicated clouds, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/3.11/html-single/architecture/#pv-access-modes[Access Modes].

[NOTE]
====
Since {PRODUCT} version 7.5, images and templates for {OPENSHIFT} 3.x are deprecated. These images and templates do not get new features, but remain supported until the end of full support for {OPENSHIFT} version 3.x. For more information about the full support lifecycle phase for {OPENSHIFT} version 3.x, see https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift_noncurrent[Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Life Cycle Policy (non-current versions)].
====

[NOTE]
====
Do not use {PRODUCT} templates with {OPENSHIFT} 4.x. To deploy {PRODUCT} on {OPENSHIFT} 4.x, see the instructions in {URL_DEPLOYING_OPENSHIFT_OPERATOR}[_{DEPLOYING_OPENSHIFT_OPERATOR}_].
