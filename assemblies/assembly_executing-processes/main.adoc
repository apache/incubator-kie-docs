// Purpose statement for the assembly
As a business analyst or business rules developer, you can use {CENTRAL} to create forms for human tasks, providing a rich interface for collecting data. In this example, you will create a simple pizza order form that a customer (Bill) will complete and send to the pizza place. The pizza place employee (Katy) will process the order and send an order confirmation message containing the total cost for the order.
