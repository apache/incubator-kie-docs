= The {PLANNER} solver

:context: optaplanner-solver

Solving a planning problem with OptaPlanner consists of the following steps:

. *Model your planning problem* as a class annotated with the `@PlanningSolution` annotation (for example, the `NQueens` class).
. *Configure a Solver* (for example a First Fit and Tabu Search solver for any `NQueens` instance).
. *Load a problem data set* from your data layer (for example a Four Queens instance). That is the planning problem.
. *Solve it* with `Solver.solve(problem)`, which returns the best solution found.

== Configuring the {PLANNER} solver
You can use the following methods to configure your OptaPlanner solver:

* Use an XML file.
* Use the `SolverConfig` API.
* Add class annotations and JavaBean property annotations on the domain model.
* Control the method that OptaPlanner uses to access your domain.
* Define custom properties.

[[solverConfigurationByXML]]
[id='xml-configuration-proc_{context}']
=== Using an XML file to configure the {PLANNER_SHORT} solver
You can use an XML file to configure the solver. In a typical project that follows the Maven directory structure, after you build a `Solver` instance with the `SolverFactory`, the `solverConfig` XML file is located in the `$PROJECT_DIR/src/main/resources/org/optaplanner/examples/<PROJECT>/solver` directory, where `<PROJECT>` is the name of your OptaPlanner project. Alternatively, you can create a `SolverFactory` from a file with `SolverFactory.createFromXmlFile()`.
However, for portability reasons, a classpath resource is recommended.


Both a `Solver` and a `SolverFactory` have a generic type called `Solution_`, which is the class representing a planning problem and solution.

OptaPlanner makes it relatively easy to switch optimization algorithms by changing the configuration.
//There is a benchmarker which enables you to test different configurations against each other and report the most appropriate configuration for your use case.

.Procedure
. Build a `Solver` instance with the `SolverFactory`.

. Configure the solver configuration XML file:
.. Define the model.
.. Define the score function.
.. Optional: Configure the optimization algorithm.
+
The following example is a solver XML file for the NQueens problem:
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]

[NOTE]
====
On some environments, for example OSGi and JBoss modules, classpath resources such as the solver config, score DRLs, and domain classe) in your JAR files might not be available to the default `ClassLoader` of the `optaplanner-core` JAR file.
In those cases, provide the `ClassLoader` of your classes as a parameter:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
       SolverFactory<NQueens> solverFactory = SolverFactory.createFromXmlResource(
               ".../nqueensSolverConfig.xml", getClass().getClassLoader());
----
====

. Configure the `SolverFactory` with a solver configuration XML file, provided as a classpath resource as defined by `ClassLoader.getResource()`:
+
[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
       SolverFasctory<NQueens> solverFactory = SolverFactory.createFromXmlResource(
               "org/optaplanner/examples/nqueens/solver/nqueensSolverConfig.xml");
       Solver<NQueens> solver = solverFactory.buildSolver();
----

[[solverConfigurationByJavaAPI]]
[id='using-java-api-proc_{context}']
=== Using the Java API  to configure the {PLANNER_SHORT} solver

You can configure a solver by using the `SolverConfig` API. This is especially useful to change values dynamically at runtime. The following example changes the running time based on system properties before building the `Solver` in the NQueens project:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
        SolverConfig solverConfig = SolverConfig.createFromXmlResource(
                "org/optaplanner/examples/nqueens/solver/nqueensSolverConfig.xml");
        solverConfig.withTerminationConfig(new TerminationConfig()
                        .withMinutesSpentLimit(userInput));

        SolverFactory<NQueens> solverFactory = SolverFactory.create(solverConfig);
        Solver<NQueens> solver = solverFactory.buildSolver();
----

Every element in the solver configuration XML file is available as a `Config` class
or a property on a `Config` class in the package namespace `org.optaplanner.core.config`.
These `Config` classes are the Java representation of the XML format.
They build the runtime components of the package namespace `org.optaplanner.core.impl` and assemble them into an efficient `Solver`.

[NOTE]
====
To configure a `SolverFactory` dynamically for each user request, build a template `SolverConfig` during initialization and copy it with the copy constructor for each user request. The following example shows how to do this with the NQueens problem:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
    private SolverConfig template;

    public void init() {
        template = SolverConfig.createFromXmlResource(
                "org/optaplanner/examples/nqueens/solver/nqueensSolverConfig.xml");
        template.setTerminationConfig(new TerminationConfig());
    }

    // Called concurrently from different threads
    public void userRequest(..., long userInput) {
        SolverConfig solverConfig = new SolverConfig(template); // Copy it
        solverConfig.getTerminationConfig().setMinutesSpentLimit(userInput);
        SolverFactory<NQueens> solverFactory = SolverFactory.create(solverConfig);
        Solver<NQueens> solver = solverFactory.buildSolver();
        ...
    }
----
====

[[annotationAlternatives]]
[id='planner-annotations-con_{context}']
=== {PLANNER_SHORT} annotation

You must specify which classes in your domain model are planning entities, which properties are planning variables, and so on. Use one of the following methods to add annotations to your {PLANNER_SHORT} project:

* Add class annotations and JavaBean property annotations on the domain model.  The property annotations must be on the getter method, not on the setter method. Annotated  getter methods do not need to be public. This is the recommended method.
* Add class annotations and field annotations on the domain model. Annotated fields do not need to be public.


[[domainAccess]]
[id='specifying-domain-access-proc_{context}']
=== Specifying {PLANNER_SHORT} domain access

By default, OptaPlanner accesses your domain using reflection. Reflection is reliable but slow compared to direct access. Alternatively, you can configure OptaPlanner to access your domain using Gizmo, which will generate bytecode that directly accesses the
fields and methods of your domain without reflection. However, this method has the following restrictions:

* The planning annotations can only be on public fields and
  public getters.
* `io.quarkus.gizmo:gizmo` must be on the classpath.

NOTE: These restrictions do not apply when you use OptaPlanner with Quarkus because Gizmo is the default domain access type.

.Procedure
To use Gizmo outside of Quarkus, set the `domainAccessType` in the
solver configuration:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
  <solver>
    <domainAccessType>GIZMO</domainAccessType>
  </solver>
----

[[customPropertiesConfiguration]]
[id='configuring-custom-properties-proc_{context}']
=== Configuring custom properties

In your OptaPlanner projects, you can add custom properties to solver configuration elements that instantiate classes and have documents that explicitly mention custom properties.

.Prerequisites
* You have a solver.

.Procedure
. Add a custom property.
+
For example, if your `EasyScoreCalculator` has heavy calculations which are cached
and you want to increase the cache size in one benchmark add the `myCacheSize` property:
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
  <scoreDirectorFactory>
    <easyScoreCalculatorClass>...MyEasyScoreCalculator</easyScoreCalculatorClass>
    <easyScoreCalculatorCustomProperties>
      <property name="myCacheSize" value="1000"/><!-- Override value -->
    </easyScoreCalculatorCustomProperties>
  </scoreDirectorFactory>
----

. Add a public setter for each custom property, which is called when a `Solver` is built.
+
[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
public class MyEasyScoreCalculator extends EasyScoreCalculator<MySolution, SimpleScore> {

        private int myCacheSize = 500; // Default value

        @SuppressWarnings("unused")
        public void setMyCacheSize(int myCacheSize) {
            this.myCacheSize = myCacheSize;
        }

    ...
}
----
+
Most value types are supported, including `boolean`, `int`, `double`, `BigDecimal`, `String` and `enums`.


[[useTheSolver]]
[[theSolverInterface]]
[id='solver-con_{context}']
== The {PLANNER_SHORT} Solver
A solver finds the best and optimal solution to your planning problem. A solver can only solve one planning problem instance at a time. Solvers are built with the `SolverFactory` method:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
public interface Solver<Solution_> {

    Solution_ solve(Solution_ problem);

    ...
}
----

A solver should only be accessed from a single thread, except for the methods that are specifically documented in `javadoc` as being thread-safe. The `solve()` method hogs the current thread. Hogging the thread can cause HTTP timeouts for REST services and it requires extra code to solve multiple data sets in parallel. To avoid such issues, use a `SolverManager` instead.


[[solvingAProblem]]
[id='solving-a-problem-proc_{context}']
=== Solving a problem

Use the solver to solve a planning problem.

.Prerequisites
* A `Solver` built from a solver configuration
* An `@PlanningSolution` annotation that represents the planning problem instance

.Procedure
Provide the planning problem as an argument to the `solve()` method. The solver will return the best solution found.

The following example solves the NQueens problem:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
    NQueens problem = ...;
    NQueens bestSolution = solver.solve(problem);
----

In this example, the `solve()` method will return an `NQueens` instance with every `Queen` assigned to a `Row`.

[NOTE]
====
The solution instance given to the `solve(Solution)` method can be partially or fully initialized, which is often the case in repeated planning.
====

.Best Solution for the Four Queens Puzzle in 8ms (Also an Optimal Solution)
ifdef::OPTAPLANNER-COMM[]
image::PlannerConfiguration/solvedNQueens04.png[align="left"]
endif::OPTAPLANNER-COMM[]
ifdef::OPTAPLANNER-ENT[]
image::optimizer/solvedNQueens04.png[align="left"]
endif::OPTAPLANNER-ENT[]


The `solve(Solution)` method can take a long time depending on the problem size and the solver configuration. The `Solver` intelligently works through the search space of possible solutions and remembers the best solution it encounters during solving.
Depending on a number of factors, including problem size, how much time the `Solver` has, the solver configuration, and so forth, the `best` solution might or might not be an `optimal` solution.

[NOTE]
====
The solution instance given to the method `solve(Solution)` is changed by the `Solver`, but do not mistake it for the best solution.

The solution instance returned by the methods `solve(Solution)` or `getBestSolution()` is most likely a planning clone of the instance given to the method `solve(Solution)`, which implies it is a different instance.
====

[[environmentMode]]
[id='solver-environment-con_{context}']
=== Solver environment mode

The solver environment mode enables you to detect common bugs in your implementation.
It does not affect the logging level.

A solver has a single random instance. Some solver configurations use the random instance a lot more than others.
For example, the Simulated Annealing algorithm depends highly on random numbers, while `Tabu Search` only depends on it to resolve score ties.
The environment mode influences the seed of that random instance.


You can set the environment mode in the solver configuration XML file. The following example sets the `FAST_ASSERT` mode:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<solver xmlns="https://www.optaplanner.org/xsd/solver" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="https://www.optaplanner.org/xsd/solver https://www.optaplanner.org/xsd/solver/solver.xsd">
  <environmentMode>FAST_ASSERT</environmentMode>
  ...
</solver>
----


.The following list describes the environment modes that you can use in the solver configuration file:

[[environmentModeFullAssert]]
* `FULL_ASSERT` mode turns on all assertions, for example the assertion that the incremental score calculation is uncorrupted for each move, to fail-fast on a bug in a Move implementation, a constraint, the engine itself, and so on.  This mode is reproducible. It is also intrusive because it calls the method `calculateScore()` more frequently than a non-assert mode. The `FULL_ASSERT` mode is very slow because it does not rely on incremental score calculation.

[[environmentModeNonIntrusiveFullAssert]]
* `NON_INTRUSIVE_FULL_ASSERT` mode turns on several assertions to fail-fast on a bug in a Move implementation, a constraint, the engine itself, and so on. This mode is reproducible. It is non-intrusive because it does not call the method `calculateScore()` more frequently than a non assert mode. The `NON_INTRUSIVE_FULL_ASSERT` mode is very slow because it does not rely on incremental score calculation.

[[environmentModeFastAssert]]
* `FAST_ASSERT` mode turns on most assertions, such as the assertions that an undoMove's score is the same as before the Move, to fail-fast on a bug in a Move implementation, a constraint, the engine itself, and so on. This mode is reproducible. It is also intrusive because it calls the method `calculateScore()` more frequently than a non-assert mode. The `FAST_ASSERT` mode is slow. Write a test case that does a short run of your planning problem with the `FAST_ASSERT` mode on.

[[environmentModeReproducible]]
* `REPRODUCIBLE` mode is the default mode because it is recommended during development. In this mode, two runs in the same OptaPlanner version execute the same code in the same order. Those two runs have the same result at every step, except if the following note applies. This enables you to reproduce bugs consistently.
It also enables you to benchmark certain refactorings, such as a score constraint performance optimization, fairly across runs.
+
[NOTE]
====
Despite using `REPRODCIBLE` mode, your application might still not be fully reproducible for the following reasons:

* Use of `HashSet` or another `Collection` which has an inconsistent order between JVM runs for collections of planning entities or planning values but not normal problem facts, especially in the solution implementation. Replace it with `LinkedHashSet`.
* Combining a time gradient dependent algorithm, most notably the Simulated Annealing algorithm, together with time spent termination. A sufficiently large difference in allocated CPU time will influence the time gradient values. Replace the Simulated Annealing algorithms with the Late Acceptance algorithm, or replace time spent termination with step count termination.
====

* `REPRODUCIBLE` mode can be slightly slower than `NON_REPRODUCIBLE` mode.
If your production environment can benefit from reproducibility, use this mode in production. In practice, `REPRODUCIBLE` mode uses the default fixed random seed if no seed is specified and it also disables certain concurrency optimizations such as work stealing.

[[environmentModeProduction]]
* `NON_REPRODUCIBLE` mode can be slightly faster than `REPRODUCIBLE` mode.
Avoid using it during development because it makes debugging and bug fixing difficult.
If reproducibility isn't important in your production environment, use `NON_REPRODUCIBLE` mode in production. In practice, this mode uses no fixed random seed if no seed is specified.

[[logging]]
[id='logging-level-proc_{context}']
=== Changing the OptaPlanner solver logging level
You can change the logging level in an OptaPlanner solver to review solver activity. The following list describes the different logging levels:

* **error**: Logs errors, except those that are thrown to the calling code as a `RuntimeException`.
+
If an error occurs, OptaPlanner normally fails fast. It throws a subclass of `RuntimeException` with a detailed message to the calling code. To avoid duplicate log messages, it does not log it as an error. Unless the calling code explicitly catches and eliminates that `RuntimeException`, a `Thread`'s default `ExceptionHandler` will log it as an error anyway. Meanwhile, the code is disrupted from doing further harm or obfuscating the error.

* **warn**: Logs suspicious circumstances
* **info**: Logs every phase and the solver itself
* **debug**: Logs every step of every phase
* **trace**: Logs every move of every step of every phase

[NOTE]
====
Specifying `trace` logging will slow down performance considerably. However, `trace` logging is invaluable during development to discover a bottleneck.

Even `debug` logging can slow down performance considerably for fast stepping algorithms such as Late Acceptance and Simulated Annealing,
but not for slow stepping algorithms such as Tabu Search.

Both trace` and `debug` logging cause congestion in multithreaded solving with most appenders.

In Eclipse, `debug` logging to the console tends to cause congestion with score calculation speeds above 10000 per second. Neither IntelliJ or the Maven command line suffer from this problem.
====

.Procedure

Set the logging level to `debug` logging to see when the phases end and how fast steps are taken.

The following example shows output from debug logging:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
INFO  Solving started: time spent (3), best score (-4init/0), random (JDK with seed 0).
DEBUG     CH step (0), time spent (5), score (-3init/0), selected move count (1), picked move (Queen-2 {null -> Row-0}).
DEBUG     CH step (1), time spent (7), score (-2init/0), selected move count (3), picked move (Queen-1 {null -> Row-2}).
DEBUG     CH step (2), time spent (10), score (-1init/0), selected move count (4), picked move (Queen-3 {null -> Row-3}).
DEBUG     CH step (3), time spent (12), score (-1), selected move count (4), picked move (Queen-0 {null -> Row-1}).
INFO  Construction Heuristic phase (0) ended: time spent (12), best score (-1), score calculation speed (9000/sec), step total (4).
DEBUG     LS step (0), time spent (19), score (-1),     best score (-1), accepted/selected move count (12/12), picked move (Queen-1 {Row-2 -> Row-3}).
DEBUG     LS step (1), time spent (24), score (0), new best score (0), accepted/selected move count (9/12), picked move (Queen-3 {Row-3 -> Row-2}).
INFO  Local Search phase (1) ended: time spent (24), best score (0), score calculation speed (4000/sec), step total (2).
INFO  Solving ended: time spent (24), best score (0), score calculation speed (7000/sec), phase total (2), environment mode (REPRODUCIBLE).
----

All time spent values are in milliseconds.

Everything is logged to http://www.slf4j.org/[SLF4J], which is a simple logging facade
that delegates every log message to Logback, Apache Commons Logging, Log4j, or java.util.logging. Add a dependency to the logging adaptor for your logging framework of choice.

[id='logback-proc_{context}']
=== Using Logback to log OptaPlanner solver activity
Logback is the recommended logging frameworkd to use with {PLANNER_SHORT}. Use Logback to log OptaPlanner solver activity.

.Prerequisites
* You have an OptaPlanner project.

.Procedure

. Add the following Maven dependency to your {PLANNER_SHORT} project's `pom.xml` file:
+
NOTE: You do not need to add an extra bridge dependency.
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
    <dependency>
      <groupId>ch.qos.logback</groupId>
      <artifactId>logback-classic</artifactId>
      <version>1.x</version>
    </dependency>
----

. Configure the logging level on the `org.optaplanner` package in your `logback.xml` file as shown in the following example where `<LEVEL>` is a logging level listed in xref:logback-proc_{context}[].
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<configuration>

  <logger name="org.optaplanner" level="<LEVEL>"/>

  ...

</configuration>
----
. Optional: If you have a multitenant application where multiple `Solver` instances might be running at the same time, separate the logging of each instance into separate files:
.. Surround the `solve()` call with  http://logback.qos.ch/manual/mdc.html[Mapped Diagnostic Context] (MDC):
+
[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
        MDC.put("tenant.name",tenantName);
        MySolution bestSolution = solver.solve(problem);
        MDC.remove("tenant.name");
----

.. Configure your logger to use different files for each `${tenant.name}`.
For example, use a `SiftingAppender` in the `logback.xml` file:
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
  <appender name="fileAppender" class="ch.qos.logback.classic.sift.SiftingAppender">

        ...
      </appender>
    </sift>
  </appender>
----
+
[NOTE]
====
When running multiple solvers or one multithreaded solve,
most appenders, including the console, cause congestion with `debug` and `trace` logging.
Switch to an async appender to avoid this problem or turn off `debug` logging.
====

. If OptaPlanner doesn't recognize the new level, temporarily add the system property `-Dlogback._LEVEL_=true` to troubleshoot.

. Open your monitoring system to view the metrics for your OptaPlanner project. The following metrics are exposed:
+
[NOTE]
====
The names and format of the metrics vary depending on the registry.
====
+
* `optaplanner.solver.errors.total`: the total number of errors that occurred while solving since the start
of the measuring.
* `optaplanner.solver.solve-length.active-count`: the number of solvers currently solving.
* `optaplanner.solver.solve-length.seconds-max`: run time of the
longest-running currently active solver.
* `optaplanner.solver.solve-length.seconds-duration-sum`: the sum of each active solver's solve duration. For example, if there are two active solvers, one running for three minutes and the other for one minute, the total solve time is four minutes.

[[randomNumberGenerator]]
[id='cofiguring-random-number-proc_{context}']
=== Configuring the random number generator

Many heuristics and metaheuristics depend on a pseudorandom number generator for move selection, to resolve score ties, probability based move acceptance, and so on. During solving, the same random instance is reused to improve reproducibility, performance, and uniform distribution of random values.

A random seed is a number used to initialize a pseudorandom number generator.

.Procedure
. Optional: To change the random seed of a random instance, specify a `randomSeed`:
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<solver xmlns="https://www.optaplanner.org/xsd/solver" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="https://www.optaplanner.org/xsd/solver https://www.optaplanner.org/xsd/solver/solver.xsd">
  <randomSeed>0</randomSeed>
  ...
</solver>
----

. Optional: To change the pseudorandom number generator implementation, specify a value for the `randomType` property listed in the solver configuration file below, where `<RANDOM_NUMBER_GENERATOR>` is a pseudorandom number generator:
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
<solver xmlns="https://www.optaplanner.org/xsd/solver" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="https://www.optaplanner.org/xsd/solver https://www.optaplanner.org/xsd/solver/solver.xsd">
  <randomType><RANDOM_NUMBER_GENERATOR></randomType>
  ...
</solver>
----
+
The following pseudorandom number generators are supported:

* `JDK` (default): Standard random number generator implementation (`java.util.Random`)
* `MERSENNE_TWISTER`: Random number generator implementation by http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/userguide/random.html[Commons Math]
* `WELL512A`, `WELL1024A`, `WELL19937A`, `WELL19937C`, `WELL44497A` and `WELL44497B`: Random number generator implementation by http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/userguide/random.html[Commons Math]

For most use cases, the value of the `randomType` property has no significant impact on the average quality of the best solution on multiple data sets.
//If you want to confirm this on your use case, use the benchmarker.


[[solverManager]]
[id='sovlermanager-con_{context}']
== The {PLANNER_SHORT} SolverManager

A `SolverManager` is a facade for one or more `Solver` instances
to simplify solving planning problems in REST and other enterprise services.

Unlike the `Solver.solve(...)` method, a `SolverManager` has the following characteristics:

* `SolverManager.solve(...)` returns immediately: it schedules a problem for asynchronous solving without blocking the calling thread.
This avoids timeout issues of HTTP and other technologies.
* `SolverManager.solve(...)` solves multiple planning problems of the same domain, in parallel.

Internally, a `SolverManager` manages a thread pool of solver threads, which call `Solver.solve(...)`,
and a thread pool of consumer threads, which handle best solution changed events.

In Quarkus and Spring Boot, the `SolverManager` instance is automatically injected in your code.
If you are using a platform other than Quarkus or Spring Boot, build a `SolverManager` instance with the `create(...)` method:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
SolverConfig solverConfig = SolverConfig.createFromXmlResource(".../cloudBalancingSolverConfig.xml");
SolverManager<CloudBalance, UUID> solverManager = SolverManager.create(solverConfig, new SolverManagerConfig());
----

Each problem submitted to the `SolverManager.solve(...)` methods must have a unique problem ID.
Later calls to `getSolverStatus(problemId)` or `terminateEarly(problemId)` use that problem ID
to distinguish between planning problems.
The problem ID must be an immutable class, such as `Long`, `String`, or `java.util.UUID`.

The `SolverManagerConfig` class has a `parallelSolverCount` property
that controls how many solvers are run in parallel.
For example, if the `parallelSolverCount` property` is set to `4` and you submit five problems, four problems start solving immediately and the fifth problem starts when one of the first problems ends. If those problems solve for five minutes each, the fifth problem takes 10 minutes to finish. By default, `parallelSolverCount` is set to `AUTO`, which resolves to half the CPU cores, regardless of the `moveThreadCount` of the solvers.

To retrieve the best solution, after solving terminates normally use `SolverJob.getFinalBestSolution()`:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
CloudBalance problem1 = ...;
UUID problemId = UUID.randomUUID();
// Returns immediately
SolverJob<CloudBalance, UUID> solverJob = solverManager.solve(problemId, problem1);
...
CloudBalance solution1;
try {
    // Returns only after solving terminates
    solution1 = solverJob.getFinalBestSolution();
} catch (InterruptedException | ExecutionException e) {
    throw ...;
}
----

However, there are better approaches, both for solving batch problems before a user needs the solution as well as for live solving while a user is actively waiting for the solution.

The current `SolverManager` implementation runs on a single computer node,
but future work aims to distribute solver loads across a cloud.


[[solverManagerSolveBatch]]
[id='batch-solving-con_{context}']
=== Batch solving problems

Batch solving is solving multiple data sets in parallel. Batch solving is particularly useful overnight:

* There are typically few or no problem changes in the middle of the night.
Some organizations enforce a deadline, for example, _submit all day off requests before midnight_.
* The solvers can run for much longer, often hours, because nobody is waiting for the results and CPU resources are often cheaper.
* Solutions are available when employees arrive at work the next working day.


.Procedure
To batch solve problems in parallel, limited by `parallelSolverCount`,
call `solve(...)` for each data set created the following class:
+
[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
public class TimeTableService {

    private SolverManager<TimeTable, Long> solverManager;

    // Returns immediately, call it for every data set
    public void solveBatch(Long timeTableId) {
        solverManager.solve(timeTableId,
                // Called once, when solving starts
                this::findById,
                // Called once, when solving ends
                this::save);
    }

    public TimeTable findById(Long timeTableId) {...}

    public void save(TimeTable timeTable) {...}

}
----




[[solverManagerSolveAndListen]]
[id='show-progress-proc_{context}']
=== Solve and listen to show progress

When a solver is running while a user is waiting for a solution,
the user might need to wait for several minutes or hours before receiving a result.
To assure the user that everything is going well,
show progress by displaying the best solution and best score attained so far.

.Procedure
. To handle intermediate best solutions, use `solveAndListen(...)`:
+
[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
public class TimeTableService {

    private SolverManager<TimeTable, Long> solverManager;

    // Returns immediately
    public void solveLive(Long timeTableId) {
        solverManager.solveAndListen(timeTableId,
                // Called once, when solving starts
                this::findById,
                // Called multiple times, for every best solution change
                this::save);
    }

    public TimeTable findById(Long timeTableId) {...}

    public void save(TimeTable timeTable) {...}

    public void stopSolving(Long timeTableId) {
        solverManager.terminateEarly(timeTableId);
    }

}
----
+
This implementation is using the database to communicate with the UI, which polls the database.
More advanced implementations push the best solutions directly to the UI or a messaging queue.

. When the user is satisfied with the intermediate best solution
and does not want to wait any longer for a better one, call `SolverManager.terminateEarly(problemId)`.
