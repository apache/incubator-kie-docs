// Purpose statement for the assembly
As a business rules developer, you can use high available event-driven decisioning, including Complex Event Processing (CEP), in your code that uses the {DECISION_ENGINE}. You can implement high available event-driven decisioning on {OPENSHIFT}.

You cannot use a standard deployment of {PRODUCT} on {OPENSHIFT}, as described in {URL_DEPLOYING_OPENSHIFT_OPERATOR}[_{DEPLOYING_OPENSHIFT_OPERATOR}_], to implement high available event-driven decisioning, because the standard deployment supports only stateless processing. You must therefore create a custom implementation using the provided reference implementation.

.Prerequisites

* A {OPENSHIFT} version 4 environment is available. For the exact versions of {OPENSHIFT} that the current release supports, see https://access.redhat.com/articles/3405381[Red Hat Process Automation Manager 7 Supported Configurations].
* A Kafka Cluster is deployed in the OpenShift environment with Red Hat AMQ Streams.
* The OpenJDK Java development environment is installed.
* Maven, Docker, and kubectl are installed.
* The `oc` OpenShift command line tool is installed.
