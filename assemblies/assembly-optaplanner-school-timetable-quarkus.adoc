= {PLANNER} on {QUARKUS}: a school time table quick start guide

This guide walks you through the process of creating a {QUARKUS}
application with {PLANNER}'s constraint solving artificial intelligence (AI). You will build a REST application that optimizes a school timetable for students and teachers

Your service will assign `Lesson` instances to `Timeslot` and `Room` instances automatically
by using AI to adhere to the following hard and soft _scheduling constraints_:

* A room can have at most one lesson at the same time.
* A teacher can teach at most one lesson at the same time.
* A student can attend at most one lesson at the same time.
* A teacher prefers to teach in a single room.
* A teacher prefers to teach sequential lessons and dislikes gaps between lessons.

Mathematically speaking, school timetabling is an _NP-hard_ problem. That means it is difficult to scale. Simply iterating through all possible combinations with brute force would take millions of years for a non-trivial dataset, even on a supercomputer. Fortunately, AI constraint solvers such as {PLANNER} have advanced algorithms
that deliver a near-optimal solution in a reasonable amount of time. What is considered to be a reasonable amount of time is subjective and depends on the goals of your problem.

.Prerequisites

* OpenJDK {OPTAPLANNER_JDK_VERSION} or later is installed. Red Hat build of Open JDK is available from the https://access.redhat.com/jbossnetwork/restricted/listSoftware.html[Software Downloads] page in the Red Hat Customer Portal (login required).

* Apache Maven {OPTAPLANNER_MAVEN_VERSION} or higher is installed. Maven is available from the https://maven.apache.org/[Apache Maven Project] website.

* An IDE, such as IntelliJ IDEA, VSCode, Eclipse, or NetBeans is available.

* You have created a Quakus OptaPlanner project as described in xref:optaplanner-quarkus-con_getting-started-optaplanner[].
