This guide walks you through the process of creating a {QUARKUS}
application with {PLANNER}'s constraint solving artificial intelligence (AI). You will build a REST application that optimizes a school timetable for students and teachers

Your service will assign `Lesson` instances to `Timeslot` and `Room` instances automatically
by using AI to adhere to the following hard and soft _scheduling constraints_:

* A room can have at most one lesson at the same time.
* A teacher can teach at most one lesson at the same time.
* A student can attend at most one lesson at the same time.
* A teacher prefers to teach in a single room.
* A teacher prefers to teach sequential lessons and dislikes gaps between lessons.

Mathematically speaking, school timetabling is an _NP-hard_ problem. That means it is difficult to scale. Simply iterating through all possible combinations with brute force would take millions of years for a non-trivial dataset, even on a supercomputer. Fortunately, AI constraint solvers such as {PLANNER} have advanced algorithms
that deliver a near-optimal solution in a reasonable amount of time. What is considered to be a reasonable amount of time is subjective and depends on the goals of your problem.
