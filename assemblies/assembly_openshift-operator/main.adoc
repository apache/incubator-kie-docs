// Purpose statement for the assembly
As a system engineer, you can deploy a {PRODUCT} environment on {OPENSHIFT} to provide an infrastructure to develop or execute processes and other business assets. You can use OpenShift Operators to deploy the environment defined in a structured YAML file and to maintain and modify this environment as necessary.

.Prerequisites

* A {OPENSHIFT} environment is available. The Operator is supported on {OPENSHIFT} version 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3.
* At least four gigabytes of memory are available in the OpenShift environment.
* The OpenShift project for the deployment is created.
* You are logged in to the project using the OpenShift web console.
* Dynamic persistent volume (PV) provisioning is enabled. Alternatively, if dynamic PV provisioning is not enabled,  enough persistent volumes must be available. By default, the deployed components require the following PV sizes:
ifdef::PAM[]
** Each {KIE_SERVER} deployment by default requires one 1Gi PV for the database. You can change the database PV size. You can deploy multiple {KIE_SERVERS}; each requires a separate database PV. This requirement does not apply if you use an external database server.
endif::PAM[]
** By default, {CENTRAL} requires one 1Gi PV. You can change the PV size for {CENTRAL} persistent storage.
ifdef::PAM[]
** {CENTRAL} Monitoring requires one 64Mi PV.
** Smart Router requires one 64Mi PV.
endif::PAM[]
* If you intend to scale any of the {CENTRAL}
ifdef::PAM[]
or {CENTRAL} Monitoring
endif::PAM[]
pods, your OpenShift environment supports persistent volumes with `ReadWriteMany` mode. If your environment does not support this mode, you can use NFS to provision the volumes.
