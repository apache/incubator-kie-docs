// Purpose statement for the assembly
As a system engineer, you can deploy a {PRODUCT} environment on {OPENSHIFT} to provide an infrastructure to develop or execute processes and other business assets. You can use OpenShift Operators to deploy the environment defined in a structured YAML file and to maintain and modify this environment as necessary.

.Prerequisites

* An {OPENSHIFT} environment is available. The Operator is supported on {OPENSHIFT} version 4.1 and higher.
* At least four gigabytes of memory are available in the OpenShift environment.
* The OpenShift project for the deployment is created.
* You are logged in to the project using the OpenShift web console.
* Dynamic persistent volume (PV) provisioning is enabled. Alternatively, if dynamic PV provisioning is not enabled,  enough persistent volumes must be available. By default, the following sizes are required:
ifdef::PAM[]
** Each deployed replicated set of {KIE_SERVER} pods, by default, requires one 1Gi PV for the database. You can change the database PV size. You can deploy multiple immutable servers; each requires a separate database PV. This requirement does not apply if you use an external database server.
endif::PAM[]
** By default, {CENTRAL} requires one 1Gi PV. You can change the PV size for {CENTRAL} persistent storage.
ifdef::PAM[]
** {CENTRAL} Monitoring requires one 64Mi PV.
** Smart Router requires one 64Mi PV.
endif::PAM[]
* If you intend to scale any of the {CENTRAL}
ifdef::PAM[]
or {CENTRAL} Monitoring
endif::PAM[]
pods, your OpenShift environment supports persistent volumes with `ReadWriteMany` mode.

[IMPORTANT]
====
`ReadWriteMany` mode is not supported on OpenShift Online and OpenShift Dedicated.
