// Purpose statement for the assembly
As a system engineer, you can deploy a {PRODUCT} trial environment on {OPENSHIFT} to evaluate or demonstrate development and use of rules and other business assets.

.Prerequisites

* {OPENSHIFT} version 3.11 is deployed.
* At least three gigabytes of memory are available in the OpenShift cluster/namespace.
* The OpenShift project for the deployment is created.
* You are logged in to the project using the `oc` command. For more information about the `oc` command-line tool, see the OpenShift https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/3.11/html-single/cli_reference/[CLI Reference]. If you want to use the OpenShift Web console to deploy templates, you must also be logged on using the Web console.

[NOTE]
====
Since {PRODUCT} version 7.5, images and templates for {OPENSHIFT} 3.x are deprecated. These images and templates do not get new features, but remain supported until the end of full support for {OPENSHIFT} version 3.x. For more information about the full support lifecycle phase for {OPENSHIFT} version 3.x, see https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift_noncurrent[Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Life Cycle Policy (non-current versions)].

[NOTE]
====
Do not use {PRODUCT} templates with {OPENSHIFT} 4.x. To deploy {PRODUCT} on {OPENSHIFT} 4.x, see the instructions in {URL_DEPLOYING_ON_OPENSHIFT}#assembly-openshift-operator[_{DEPLOYING_OPENSHIFT_OPERATOR}_].
