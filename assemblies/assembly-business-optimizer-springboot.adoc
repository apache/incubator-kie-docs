This guide walks you through the process of creating a Spring Boot application with {PLANNER_SHORT}'s constraint solving artificial intelligence (AI). You will build a REST application that optimizes a school timetable for students and teachers.

Your service will assign `Lesson` instances to `Timeslot` and `Room` instances automatically by using AI to adhere to the following hard and soft _scheduling constraints_:

* A room can have at most one lesson at the same time.
* A teacher can teach at most one lesson at the same time.
* A student can attend at most one lesson at the same time.
* A teacher prefers to teach in a single room.
* A teacher prefers to teach sequential lessons and dislikes gaps between lessons.

Mathematically speaking, school timetabling is an _NP-hard_ problem. That means it is difficult to scale. Simply iterating through all possible combinations with brute force would take millions of years for a non-trivial data set, even on a supercomputer. Fortunately, AI constraint solvers such as {PLANNER_SHORT} have advanced algorithms that deliver a near-optimal solution in a reasonable amount of time. What is considered to be a reasonable amount of time is subjective and depends on the goals of your problem.

== Using Micrometer and Prometheus to monitor your school timetable OptaPlanner Spring Boot application

OptaPlanner exposes metrics through https://micrometer.io/[Micrometer], a metrics instrumentation library for Java applications. You can use Micrometer with Prometheus to monitor the OptaPlanner solver in the school timetable application.


.Prerequisites
* You have created the Spring Boot OptaPlanner school timetable application.
* Prometheus is installed. For information about installing Prometheus, see the https://prometheus.io/[Prometheus] website.

.Procedure
. Navigate to the `technology/java-spring-boot` directory.
. Add the Micrometer Prometheus dependencies to the school timetable `pom.xml` file:
+
[source]
----
<dependency>
 <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
 <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
 <groupId>io.micrometer</groupId>
 <artifactId>micrometer-registry-prometheus</artifactId>
</dependency>
----
. Add the following property to the application.properties file:
+
[source]
----
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=metrics,prometheus
----
. Start the school timetable application:
+
[source]
----
mvn spring-boot:run
----
. Open `http://localhost:8080/actuator/prometheus` in a web browser.
