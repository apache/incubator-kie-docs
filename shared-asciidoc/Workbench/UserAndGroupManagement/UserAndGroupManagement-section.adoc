[[_wb.userandgroupmgmt]]
== User and group management

=== Introduction


This section describes a feature that allows the administration of the application's users and groups using an intuitive and friendly user interface that comes integrated in both jBPM and Drools Workbenches.

Before the installation, setup and usage of this feature, this section talks about some previous concepts that need to be completely understood for the further usage:

* Security management providers and capabilities
* Installation and setup
* Usage


=== Security management providers


A security environment is usually provided by the use of a __realm__.
Realms are used to restrict the access for the different application's resources.
So realms contains information about the users, groups, roles, permissions and and any other related information.

In most of the typical scenarios the application's security is delegated to the container's security mechanism, which consumes a given realm at same time.
It's important to consider that there exist several realm implementations, for example Wildfly provides a realm based on the __application-users.properties__/__application-roles.properties__ files, Tomcat provides a realm based on the _tomcat-users.xml_ file, etc.
So keep in mind that there is no single security realm to rely on, it can be different in each installation.

The jBPM and Drools workbenches are not an exception, they're build on top Uberfire framework (aka UF), which delegates the authorization and authentication to the underlying container's security environment as well, so the consumed realm is given by the concrete deployment configuration.

==== Security management providers


Due to the potential different security environments that have to be supported, the users and groups management provides a well defined management services API with some default built-in security management providers.
A *security management
          provider* is the formal name given to a concrete user and group management service implementation for a given realm.

At this moment, by default there are two security management providers available:

* *Wildfly / EAP security management provider* - For Wildfly or EAP realms based on properties files.
* *Tomcat security management provider* - For Tomcat realms based on XML files.

If the built-in providers do not fit with the application's security realm, it is easy to build and register your own security management provider.

==== Secutiry management provider capabilities


Each security realm can provide support different operations.
For example consider the use of a Wildfly's realm based on properties files, The contents for the applications-users.properties is like:
[source]
----
admin=207b6e0cc556d7084b5e2db7d822555c
salaboy=d4af256e7007fea2e581d539e05edd1b
maciej=3c8609f5e0c908a8c361ca633ed23844
kris=0bfd0f47d4817f2557c91cbab38bb92d

john=afda4373c6021f3f5841cd6c0a027244

kieserver=16c6511893651c9b4b57e0c027a96075
----

Note that it's based on key-value pairs where the key is the __username__, and the value is the hashed value for the user's __password__.
So a user is just defined by the key, by its username, it does not have a name nor address or any other meta information.

On the other hand, consider the use of a realm provided by a Keycloak server.
The information for a user is composed by more user meta-data, such as surname, address, etc, as in the following image:


image::Workbench/UserAndGroupManagement/admin_user_view.png[align="center"]


So the different services and client side components from the users and group management API are based on __capabilities__.**Capabilities** are used to expose or restrict the available functionality provided by the different services and client side components.
Examples of capabilities are:

* Create a user
* Update a user
* Delete a user
* Update user's attributes
* Create a group
* Update a group
* Assign groups to a user
* Assign roles to a user

Each security management provider must specify a set of capabilities supported.
From the previous examples you can note that the Wildfly security management provider does not support the capability for the management of the attributes for a user - the user is only composed by the user name.
On the other hand the Keycloak provider does support this capability.

The different views and user interface components rely on the capabilities supported by each provider, so if a capability is not supported by the provider in use, the UI does not provide the views for the management of that capability.
As an example, consider that a concrete provider does not support deleting users - the delete user button on the user interface will be not available.

Please take a look at the concrete service provider documentation to check all the supported capabilities for each one, the default ones can be found https://github.com/uberfire/uberfire-extensions/tree/master/uberfire-security/uberfire-security-management[here].

=== Installation and setup


Before considering the installation and setup steps please note the following Drools and jBPM distributions come with built-in, pre-installed security management providers by default:

* *Wildfly / EAP distribution* - Both distributions use the https://github.com/uberfire/uberfire-extensions/tree/master/uberfire-security/uberfire-security-management/uberfire-security-management-wildfly[Wildfly security management provider] configured for the use of the default realm files _application-users.properties_ and _application-roles.properties_
* *Tomcat distribution* - It uses the https://github.com/uberfire/uberfire-extensions/tree/master/uberfire-security/uberfire-security-management/uberfire-security-management-tomcat[Tomcat security management provider] configured for the use of the default realm file _tomcat-users.xml_

Please read each https://github.com/uberfire/uberfire-extensions/tree/master/uberfire-security/uberfire-security-management[provider's documentation] in order to apply the concrete settings for the target deployment environment.

On the other hand, if using a custom security management provider or need to include it on an existing application, consider the following installation options:

* Enable the security management feature on an existing WAR distribution
* Setup and installation in an existing or new project

__NOTE__: If no security management provider is installed in the application, there will be no available user interface for managing the security realm.
Once a security management provider is installed and setup, the user and group management user interfaces are automatically enabled and accessible from the main menu.

==== Enable the security management feature on an existing WAR distribution


Given an existing WAR distribution of either Drools and jBPM workbenches, follow these steps in order to install and enable the user management feature:

* Ensure the following libraries are present on __WEB-INF/lib__:
+
** WEB-INF/lib/uberfire-security-management-api-6.4.0.Final..jar
** WEB-INF/lib/uberfire-security-management-backend-6.4.0.Final..jar
* Add the concrete library for the security management provider to use in __WEB-INF/lib__:
+
** Eg: WEB-INF/lib/uberfire-security-management-wildfly-6.4.0.Final..jar
** If the concrete provider you're using requires more libraries, add those as well. Please read each https://github.com/uberfire/uberfire-extensions/tree/master/uberfire-security/uberfire-security-management[provider's documentation] for more information
* Replace the whole content for file __WEB-INF/classes/security-management.properties__, or if not present, create it. The settings present on this file depend on the concrete implementation you're using. Please read each https://github.com/uberfire/uberfire-extensions/tree/master/uberfire-security/uberfire-security-management[provider's documentation] for more information.
* If you're deploying on Wildfly or EAP, please check if the __WEB-INF/jboss-deployment-structure.xml __requires any update. Please read each https://github.com/uberfire/uberfire-extensions/tree/master/uberfire-security/uberfire-security-management[provider's documentation] for more information.


==== Setup and installation in an existing or new project


If you're building an http://uberfireframework.org/[Uberfire] based web application and you want to include the user and group management feature, please read https://github.com/uberfire/uberfire-extensions/blob/master/uberfire-security/uberfire-security-management/uberfire-security-management-client-wb/README.md[this instructions].

==== Disabling the security management feature


The security management feature can be disabled, and thus no services or user interface will be available, by any of:

* Uninstalling the security management provider from the application
+ 
When no concrete security management provider installed on the application, the user and group management feature will be disabled and no services or user interface will be presented to the user.
* Removing or commenting the security management configuration file
+ 
Removing or commenting all the lines in the configuration file located at__ WEB-INF/classes/security-management.properties__ will disable the user and group management feature and no services or user interface will be presented to the user.


=== Usage


The user and group management feature is presented using two different perspectives that are available from the main __Home __menu (considering that the feature is enabled) as:


image::Workbench/UserAndGroupManagement/main_menu.png[align="center"]


Read the following sections for using both user and group management perspectives.

==== User management


The user management interface is available from the _User
          management_ menu entry in the _Home_ menu.

The interface is presented using two main panels: the users explorer on the west panel and the user editor on the center one:


image::Workbench/UserAndGroupManagement/users_perspective.png[align="center"]


The **users explorer**, on west panel, lists by default all the users present on the application's security realm:


image::Workbench/UserAndGroupManagement/users_explorer.png[align="center"]


In addition to listing all users, the users explorer allows:

* *Searching for users*
+ 
When specifying the search pattern in the search box the users list will be reduced and will display only the users that matches the search pattern.
+


image::Workbench/UserAndGroupManagement/users_explorer_search.png[align="center"]

+
Search patterns depend on the concrete security management provider being used by the application's.
Please read each https://github.com/uberfire/uberfire-extensions/tree/master/uberfire-security/uberfire-security-management[provider's documentation] for more information.
* *Creating new users*
+ 
By clicking on the __Create new user __button, a new screen will be presented on the center panel to perform a new user creation.
+


image::Workbench/UserAndGroupManagement/create_new_user.png[align="center"]

The **user editor**, on the center panel, is used to create, view, update or delete users.
Once creating a new user o clicking an existing user on the users explorer, the user editor screen is opened.

To **view an existing user**,  click on an existing user in the Users Explorer to open the User Editor screen.
For example, viewing the _admin_ user when using the Wildfly security management provider results in this screen:


image::Workbench/UserAndGroupManagement/admin_user_view_wf.png[align="center"]


Same admin user view operation but when using the Keycloak security management provider, instead of the Wildfly's one, results in this screen:


image::Workbench/UserAndGroupManagement/admin_user_view.png[align="center"]


Note that the user editor, when using the Keycloak sec.
management provider, includes the user attributes management section, but it's not present when using the Wildfly's one.
So remember that the information and actions available on the user interface depends on each provider's capabilities (as explained in previous sections).

Viewing a user in the user editor provides the following information (if provider supports it):

* The user name
* The user's attributes
* The assigned groups
* The assigned roles

In order to **update or delete an existing user**, click on the _Edit_ button present near to the username in the user editor screen:


image::Workbench/UserAndGroupManagement/admin_user_edit.png[align="center"]


Once the user editor presented in edit mode, different operations can be done (if the security management provider in use supports it):

* *Update the user's attributes*
+ 
A group selection popup is presented when clicking on _Add
to groups_ button:
+


image::Workbench/UserAndGroupManagement/kc_user_attributes.png[align="center"]

+
This popup screen allows the user to search and select or deselect the groups assigned for the user currently being edited.
* *Update assigned groups*
+ 
A group selection popup is presented when clicking on _Add
to groups_ button:
+


image::Workbench/UserAndGroupManagement/groups_selection.png[align="center"]

+
This popup screen allows the user to search and select or deselect the groups assigned for the user currently being edited.
* *Update assigned roles*
+ 
A role selection popup is presented when clicking on _Add
to roles_ button:
+


image::Workbench/UserAndGroupManagement/roles_selection.png[align="center"]

+
This popup screen allows the user to search and select or deselect the roles assigned for the user currently being edited.
* *Change user's password*
+ 
A change password popup screen is presented when clicking on the _Change password_ button:
+


image::Workbench/UserAndGroupManagement/change_password.png[align="center"]
* *Delete user*
+ 
The user currently being edited can be deleted from the realm by clicking on the _Delete_ button.


==== Group management


The group management interface is available from the _Group
          management_ menu entry in the _Home_ menu.

The interface is presented using two main panels: the groups explorer on the west panel and the group editor on the center one:


image::Workbench/UserAndGroupManagement/group_management_perspective.png[align="center"]


The **groups explorer**, on west panel, lists by default all the groups present on the application's security realm:


image::Workbench/UserAndGroupManagement/groups_explorer.png[align="center"]


In addition to listing all groups, the groups explorer allows:

* *Searching for groups*
+ 
When specifying the search pattern in the search box the users list will be reduced and will display only the users that matches the search pattern.
+


image::Workbench/UserAndGroupManagement/groups_explorer_search.png[align="center"]

+
Search patterns depend on the concrete security management provider being used by the application's.
Please read each https://github.com/uberfire/uberfire-extensions/tree/master/uberfire-security/uberfire-security-management[provider's documentation] for more information.
* *Create new groups*
+ 
By clicking on the __Create new group __button, a new screen will be presented on the center panel to perform a new group creation.
Once the new group has been created, it allows to assign users to it:
+


image::Workbench/UserAndGroupManagement/new_group_assign_users.png[align="center"]

The **group editor**, on the center panel, is used to create, view or delete groups.
Once creating a new group o clicking an existing group on the groups explorer, the group editor screen is opened. 

To **view an existing group**, click on an existing user in the Groups Explorer to open the Group Editor screen.
For example, viewing the _sales_ group results in this screen:


image::Workbench/UserAndGroupManagement/group_view.png[align="center"]


To *delete an existing group* just click on the _Delete_ button.
