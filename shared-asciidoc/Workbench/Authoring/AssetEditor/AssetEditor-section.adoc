= Asset Editor

The Asset Editor is the principle component of the workbench User-Interface.
It consists of two main views Editor and Overview.

** A : The editing area - exactly what form the editor takes depends on the Asset type. An asset can only be edited by one user at a time to avoid conflicts. When a user begins to edit an asset, a lock will automatically be acquired. This is indicated by a lock symbol appearing on the asset title bar as well as in the project explorer view (see <<_wb.projectexplorer>> for details). If a user starts editing an already locked asset a pop-up notification will appear to inform the user that the asset can't currently be edited, as it is being worked on by another user. Changes will be prevented until the editing user saves or closes the asset, or logs out of the workbench. Session timeouts will also cause locks to be released. Every user further has the option to force a lock release, if required (see the Metadata section below).
** B : This menu bar contains various actions for the Asset; such as Save, Rename, Copy etc. Note that saving, renaming and deleting are deactivated if the asset is locked by a different user.
** C : Different views for asset content or asset information.
*** Editor shows the main editor for the asset
*** Overview contains the metadata and conversation views for this editor. Explained in more detail below.
*** Source shows the asset in plain DRL. Note: This tab is only visible if the asset content can be generated into DRL.
*** Data Objects contains the model available for authoring. By default only Data Objects that reside within the same package as the asset are available for authoring. Data Objects outside of this package can be imported to become available for authoring the asset.

* Locking
+ 
The Workbench supports pessimistic locking of assets.
When one User starts editing an asset it is locked to change by other Users.
The lock is held until a period of inactivity lapses, the Editor is closed or the application stopped and restarted.
Locks can also be forcibly removed on the MetaData section of the Overview tab. 
+ 
A "padlock" icon is shown in the Editor's title bar and beside the asset in the Project Explorer when an asset is locked.
