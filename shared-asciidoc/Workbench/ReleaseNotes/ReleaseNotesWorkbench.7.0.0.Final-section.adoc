[[_wb.releasenotesworkbench.7.0.0.final]]
== New and Noteworthy in KIE Workbench 7.0.0

=== Authoring - Imports of Examples


Prior to 7.x the Workbench used to install pre-defined examples at startup. 

Version 7.x brings the ability to import examples from git repositories.
The Authoring Perspective contains a menu item for 'Examples' clicking this launches a Wizard to guide you through the import.

=== Guided Rule Editor : Support formulae in composite field constraints

Composite field constraints now support use of formulae.

When adding constraints to a Pattern the "Multiple Field Constraint" selection ("All of (and)" and "Any of (or)") supports use of formulae in addition to expressions.

=== Guided Decision Table Editor : New editor

The Guided Decision Table Editor has been extensively rewritten to support editing of multiple tables in the same editor. Tables that share an association are visibly linked making it easier to visualise relationships. Associations are infered from Actions that create or update a Fact consumed by the Conditions of another table.

Highlights include:-

- A new look and feel
- Resizable columns
- Reordering of columns by dragging and dropping "in table"
- Reordering of rows by dragging and dropping "in table"
- Repositioning of tables with drag and drop
- Panning of view to scroll content
- Zoomable view, so you can zoom "out" to see more content at once
- File locks and Version History per Decision Table
