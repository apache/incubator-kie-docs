== New and Noteworthy in KIE Workbench 7.0.0

=== Authoring - Imports of Examples


Prior to 7.x the Workbench used to install pre-defined examples at startup. 

Version 7.x brings the ability to import examples from git repositories.
The Authoring Perspective contains a menu item for 'Examples' clicking this launches a Wizard to guide you through the import.

=== Guided Rule Editor : Support formulae in composite field constraints

Composite field constraints now support use of formulae.

When adding constraints to a Pattern the "Multiple Field Constraint" selection ("All of (and)" and "Any of (or)") supports use of formulae in addition to expressions.
