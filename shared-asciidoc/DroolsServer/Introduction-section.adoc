The drools camel server (drools-camel-server) module is a war which you can deploy to execute KnowledgeBases remotely for any sort of client application.
This is not limited to JVM application clients, but any technology that can use HTTP, through a REST interface.
This version of the execution server supports stateless and stateful sessions in a native way.
