Drools Camel Server is a war file, which can be deployed in a application server (such as JBoss AS). As the service is stateless, it is possible to have have as many of these services deployed as you need to serve the client load.
Deploy on JBoss AS 4.x / Tomcat 6.x works out-of-the-box, instead some external dependencies must be added and the configuration must be changed to be deployed in JBoss AS 5
