With the (((Eclipse)))
Eclipse project files generated they can now be imported into Eclipse.
When starting Eclipse open the workspace in the root of your subversion checkout.

When calling `mvn install` all the project dependencies were downloaded and added to the local Maven repository.
Eclipse cannot find those dependencies unless you tell it where that repository is.
To do this setup an `M2_REPO` classpath variable.
