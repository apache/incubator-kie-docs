== Introduction

It's been a busy year since the last 5.x series release and so much has change.

One of the biggest complaints during the 5.x series was the lack of defined methodology for deployment.
The mechanism used by Drools and jBPM was very flexible, but it was too flexible.
A big focus for 6.0 was streamlining the build, deploy and loading(utilization) aspects of the system.
Building and deploying now align with Maven and the utilization is now convention and configuration oriented, instead of programmatic, with sane default to minimise the configuration.

The workbench has been rebuilt from the ground up, inspired by Eclipse, to provide a flexible and better integrated solution; with panels and perspectives via plugins.
The base workbench has been spun off into a standalone project called UberFire, so that anyone now can build high quality web based workbenches.
In the longer term it will facilitate user customised Drools and jBPM installations.

Git replaces JCR as the content repository, offering a fast and scalable back-end storage for content that has strong tooling support.
There has been a refocus on simplicity away from databases with an aim of storing everything as text file, even meta data is just a file.
The database is just there to provide fast indexing and search via Lucene.
This willndex.html allow repositories now to be synced and published with established infrastructure, like GitHub.

jBPM has been dramatically beefed up, thanks to the Polymita acquisition, with human tasks, form builders, class modellers, execution servers and runtime management.
All fully integrated into the new workbench.

OptaPlanner is now a top level project and getting full time attention.

A new umbrella name, KIE (Knowledge Is Everything), has been introduced to bring our related technologies together under one roof.
It also acts as the core shared around for our projects.
So expect to see it a lot.
