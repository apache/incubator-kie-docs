  <title>Overview</title>

  <para>Imagine you are developing a BPM solution which mixes process with business data. Imagine also
    you need some forms to be used within processes in order to let the users enter data. Moreover,
    you'll likely want to have some kind of dashboards to display metrics and key performance
    indicators in order to quickly assess how your processes are doing. So far so good.
  </para>

  <para>jBPM brings you all the ingredients you need to develop end-to-end business process solutions.
    The jBPM's BAM module (also known as Dashbuilder) allows for composing custom business dashboards
    by mixing data coming from heterogeneous sources of information. The module is now fully integrated
    into KIE workbench. A new specific section for dealing with dashboards has been added and it can be
    accessed either from the home page or from the menu bar, as shown in the next figure.

  <para>In the figure, within the highlighted sections, there exists two options:</para>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="bold">Business Dashboards:</emphasis>
        This option is intended to give users access to the generic dashboard tooling either to compose new dashboards
        or just to consume existing ones.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="bold">Process &amp; Task Dashboard:</emphasis>
        It opens up the Process Dashboard perspective which contains several performance indicators related to the jBPM
        execution engine.
