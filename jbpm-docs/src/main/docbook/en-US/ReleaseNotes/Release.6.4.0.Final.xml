    <title>New jBPM Process &amp; Task Dashboard</title>
    <para>The jBPM Process Dashboard has been entirely rewritten in this version and now is based on
      a native workbench perspective instead of a separated web application. The main goal is to deliver
      a better user experience, thanks to a much more appealing as well as polished user interface.</para>

    <para>This dashboard version also provides the ability to navigate from the graphical indicators to any of the
      related process or task instances. Now, end users can easily find out the instances that are related to a given
      indicator and deep into their details as well.</para>

    <para>The resulting dashboard is more fluent, more interactive and with a better integration with the jBPM runtime.</para>
