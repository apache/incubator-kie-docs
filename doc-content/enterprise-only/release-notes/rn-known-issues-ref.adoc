.An error message about missing {KIE_SERVER} configuration on dashbuilder runtime must be improved [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHPAM-3058[RHPAM-3058]]

Issue: The dashbuilder runtime user interface currently displaying a wrong error message about missing {KIE_SERVER} configuration.

Steps to reproduce:

. Start {CENTRAL}.
. Try to import the {KIE_SERVER} dataset on dashbuilder runtime.

Expected result: The dashbuilder runtime displays an error message with missing or wrong {KIE_SERVER} system property.

Actual result: The dashbuilder runtime is not displaying an error message with missing or wrong {KIE_SERVER} system property.

Workaround: None.

.The `dodeploy` file is not available in the dashbuilder runtime distribution [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHPAM-3031[RHPAM-3031]]

Issue: The dashbuilder runtime application comes as a zip folder, containing all the files that are required for the deployment. The zip folder contains a `dashbuilder-runtime.war` file, but the `dashbuilder-runtime.war.dodeploy` file is not available in the folder.

Workaround: Update zip folder by adding `dashbuilder-runtime.war.dodeploy` file as a copy of the folder `dashbuilder-runtime.war`. Alternatively, the distribution must be a war file and you can directly copy to the deployments folder.
