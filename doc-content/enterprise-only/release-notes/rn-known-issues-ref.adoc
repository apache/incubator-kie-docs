== {CENTRAL}

.When you add a deployment unit and manually enter GAV values, the runtime strategy is not set to the configured default value [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHPAM-2623[RHPAM-2623]]

Issue: In {CENTRAL}, you can configure a default runtime strategy. However, when you add a new deployment unit and enter the group, artifact, and version (GAV) values manually, the runtime strategy is not set to this configured default.

Steps to reproduce:

. Import the *Evaluation_Process* sample project into {CENTRAL}.
. In the project window, click *Settings* and then select *Deployments* -> *General Settings*.
. Change *Runtime Strategy* to `Per Process Instance`.
. Click the drop-down list next to the *Build* button and select *Build & Install*.
. In the main menu, select *Deploy* -> *Execution Servers* and then click *Add Deployment Unit*.
. Enter the values in the following list into the corresponding fields:
** *Name*: `evaluation:evaluation:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT`
** *Group Name*: `evaluation`
** *Artifact Id*: `evaluation`
** *Version*: `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT`
. Click *Next*. If you click *Finish* at this stage, the result will not be changed.
. In the window that appears, note that the runtime strategy is `Singleton`.
. Click *Finish*.
. Start the deployment.
. When the deployment has completed, click the deployment link, for example `\http://localhost:8080/kie-server/services/rest/server/containers/evaluation:evaluation:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT`.
. View the runtime strategy in the XML information displayed at the link, for example:
+
----
        <config-items>
            <itemName>RuntimeStrategy</itemName>
            <itemValue>SINGLETON</itemValue>
            <itemType>BPM</itemType>
        </config-items>
----

Expected result: The runtime strategy is `Per Process Instance`.

Actual result: The runtime strategy is `Singleton`.

Workaround: When you create a new deployment unit, select the artifact from the list without entering GAV values manually. Alternatively, manually select the runtime strategy when creating a new deployment unit.

Workaround:

. Change directory to the `optaweb-vehicle-routing-frontend` module.
. Enter the following command to download the required dependencies:
+
[source]
----
$ npm install
----
. Enter the following command to run the tests:

== Offline Maven repository

.The `offliner` tool reports errors when it downloads artifacts for an offline Maven repository [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHPAM-2234[RHPAM-2234]]

Issue: When you run the `offliner` tool to download artifacts for an offline Maven repository, the tool reports that some artifacts failed to download. The error message is `The artifact was not found in any of the provided repositories`.

Workaround: If the failed artifacts relate to `installer`, ignore the error messages. These artifacts are not required for the offline Maven repository.

In other cases, for example, for `maven-compiler-plugin` or `docbook` artifacts, specify an additional repository and run the `offliner` command again:

[subs="attributes,verbatim,macros"]
----
java -jar offliner-<version>.jar -r \https://maven.repository.redhat.com/ga/ -r \https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/ -r \https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/groups/public/ -d /home/user/temp {PRODUCT_FILE}-offliner.txt
