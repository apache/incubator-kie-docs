== Installation

//approved
.{PRODUCT} in a {JWS} datasource configuration is missing elements [https://issues.jboss.org/browse/RHPAM-2428[RHPAM-2428]]

Issue: When you use the installer to install {PRODUCT} in {JWS} and you configure a datasource, there are some missing elements that are needed for the setup to work properly.

Steps to reproduce:

. Use the installer to install {PRODUCT} on {JWS}.
. When prompted, click *Configure Advanced Properties* -> *Configure Database Settings*.
. Configure your settings and add a user name and password.
. Try running the server.

Expected result: {PRODUCT} starts.

Actual result: {PRODUCT} does not start.

Workaround: Modify the resource in the `context.xml` file as described in the "Configuring JDBC Web Server data sources" section of {URL_INSTALLING_ON_JWS}[_{INSTALLING_ON_JWS}_].

//approved
.On {EAP}, the {PRODUCT} installer creates an incorrect password vault for the created datasource [https://issues.jboss.org/browse/RHPAM-2407[RHPAM-2407]]

Issue: If you use the installer to install {PRODUCT} on {EAP} and you configure database settings, the `datasource` element in the `standalone` files is wrong and connection to the database fails.

NOTE: This issue is resolved with {PRODUCT} patch release 7.5.1.

Steps to reproduce:

. Use the installer to install {KIE_SERVER} only onto {EAP}.
. When prompted, click *Configure Advanced Properties* -> *Configure Database Settings*.
. Open the `standalone.xml` or `standalone-full.xml` file to verify user credentials.

Expected result: The datasource element in the `standalone` files should look similar to the following, where `<NEWDATASOURCE>` is the name of your database:
[source]
----
<password>${VAULT::datasource.<NEWDATASOURCE>::password::1}</password>
----

Actual Result: The datasource element in the `standalone` files looks similar to the following:

[source]
----
<password>:datasource.<NEWDATASOURCE>::password::1</password>
----

Workaround: Replace the `<password>` entry with the correct password vault entry for the database. In this example, `<NEWDATASOURCE>` is the name of your database:

[source]
----
${VAULT::datasource.<NEWDATASOURCE>::password::1}
----

Workaround: Use the legacy adapter instead of the Elytron adapter. Enter the following command to install the legacy adapter:

[source]
----
./bin/jboss-cli.sh -c --file=bin/adapter-install.cli
----


//approved
.An error might occur if you import a sample project twice [https://issues.jboss.org/browse/RHPAM-2434[RHPAM-2434]]

Issue: An `Unable to complete your request` error might appear if you import a sample project that has already been imported.

Steps to reproduce:

* Import a sample project twice. Note that this error does not always occur.

Workaround: If the sample project that failed to import is present in your space, remove it then import it again.

//approved
.In the guided rule editor, you cannot use the `is contained in comma separated list` constraint in combination with complex values [https://issues.jboss.org/browse/RHPAM-2457[RHPAM-2457]]

Issue: In the guided rule editor, you cannot use the `is contained in comma separated list` constraint in combination with complex values. Complex values are values that contain a comma or are wrapped by brackets.

Workaround: None.

//approved
.The *Bulk Reassign* check boxes on the *Task List* page reset before finishing the selected operation [https://issues.jboss.org/browse/RHPAM-2387[RHPAM-2387]]

Issue: If you select multiple tasks on the *Task List* page and then select a bulk reassignment operation, when the dialog box appears over the *Task List* page, the previously selected tasks are no longer selected.

NOTE: This issue is resolved with {PRODUCT} patch release 7.5.1.

Steps to reproduce:

* On the *Task List* page, select multiple tasks and choose a bulk reassignment operation.

Expected result: A dialog box appears on top of the *Task List* page. The list of tasks is visible on the *Task List* page and the previously selected tasks are still selected.

Actual result:  A dialog box appears on top of the *Task List* page. The list of tasks is visible on the *Task List* page and the previously selected tasks are not selected.

Workaround: None.

//approved
.The *Bulk Reassign* operation fails if you include tasks that are in a state that does not allow reassignment [https://issues.jboss.org/browse/RHPAM-2386[RHPAM-2386]]

Issue: If you select multiple tasks with various states, for example *Ready* and *Reserved*, including tasks that are in a state that does not allow reassignment, for example *Suspended* and *Completed*, then the bulk reassign operation fails.

NOTE: This issue is resolved with {PRODUCT} patch release 7.5.1.

Steps to reproduce:

. Select tasks with various states and include one task that is in the *Suspended* state.
. Run the bulk reassignment. An error message appears telling you that some of the tasks could not be reassigned because they were not in the correct state.
. Click *OK*.

Expected result: The dialog box closes and the operation is attempted on all of the tasks. Results for particular tasks are presented separately as notifications.

Actual result: The dialog box does not close. When you close it manually by clicking the *x* in the top right corner, and you check the states of the previously selected tasks, only the tasks processed before first failure are reassigned.

Workaround: Before running the bulk action, filter the tasks and omit any task that will interrupt the reassignment.

.In the DMN designer, the DMN file validation operation does not report invalid operators [https://issues.jboss.org/browse/RHDM-1119[RHDM-1119]]

Issue: In the DMN designer, if the DMN model contains an invalid operator (an operator that does not exist), for example `>>>>`, the validation operation does not report the invalid operator.

Workaround: None.

ifdef::DM[]

//approved
.Users cannot test DMN context expression in test scenarios [https://issues.jboss.org/browse/RHDM-1116[RHDM-1116]]

Issue: If you test DMN context expressions using the test scenario designer and the test fails, the corrected output has the wrong format.

Steps to reproduce:

* Create two tests where the second test is created according to the hint message in the first test, while retaining the same input as the first test.

Expected result: The corrected output has the correct format, as shown in the following example:

`{"key_a" : "value_a", "key_b" : "value_b", ...}`

Actual result: The corrected output has an incorrect format (missing double quotes), as shown in the following example:

`{key_a : value_a, key_b : value_b, ...}`



== Decision engine

.The executable model does not fully parse multi-line patterns [https://issues.jboss.org/browse/RHDM-1098[RHDM-1098]]

Issue: When a pattern has multiple lines, the executable model does not fully parse its conditions. Only the first line is parsed.

NOTE: This issue is resolved with {PRODUCT} patch release 7.5.1.

Workaround: None.

endif::[]

== High availability

//approved
.In a high-availability authoring environment, when one user imports a project, another user is unable to see it [https://issues.jboss.org/browse/RHPAM-2470[RHPAM-2470]]

Issue: When multiple users connect to a high-availability {CENTRAL} and one user creates a project, another user cannot see the project.

Steps to reproduce:

//approved
. Log in to {CENTRAL} as two different users (A and B) from two different hosts or browsers.
. As user A and as user B, open the same space.
. As user A, import a project using an external Git repository URL.

Expected result: As user B, you can see the imported project in the space.

Actual result: As user B, you cannot see the imported project in the space.

Workaround: As user B, reload the space.

//approved
.In a high-availability authoring environment, role changes in {CENTRAL} are not saved [https://issues.jboss.org/browse/RHPAM-2342[RHPAM-2342]]

Issue: If you configure a role change in high-availability {CENTRAL}, the change can be lost after a time and the roles reset to defaults.

Workaround: Configure the role change again.

//approved
.In a high-availability authoring environment, an imported project in {CENTRAL} appears multiple times [https://issues.jboss.org/browse/RHPAM-2372[RHPAM-2372]]

Issue: If you import a sample project in high-availability {CENTRAL}, the project can appear in the list several times. Some copies might not have all of the assets. The environment can slow down when this issue occurs.

Workaround: Ensure one copy has all of the assets, then remove all other copies. If {CENTRAL} performance is slow, restart all of the nodes connected to it.

//approved
.In a high-availability authoring environment, project creation fails when a {CENTRAL} node is down [https://issues.jboss.org/browse/RHPAM-2475[RHPAM-2475]]

Issue: When you create a project, the project creation does not complete. The cause is one {CENTRAL} node in a high-availability authoring environment going down.

Workaround: Create the project again.

//approved
.In a high-availability authoring environment, asset creation is not completed when a {CENTRAL} node is down [https://issues.jboss.org/browse/RHPAM-2476[RHPAM-2476]]

Issue: When you create an asset, the asset is not indexed. It is displayed in {CENTRAL} but you cannot use it. The cause is one {CENTRAL} node in a high-availability authoring environment going down.

Workaround: In the *Project Explorer* view, open the asset and click *Save*.

//approved
.In a high-availability authoring environment, multi-project import slows down {CENTRAL} [https://issues.jboss.org/browse/RHPAM-2477[RHPAM-2477]]

Issue: When a user imports multiple projects in a high-availability {CENTRAL} with multi-project import enabled, {CENTRAL} slows down and consumes significant resources.

Steps to reproduce:

. In the *Settings* menu of {CENTRAL}, enable multi-project import.
. Enter a space and import all samples at one time.

Expected result: {CENTRAL} operates normally and imports the samples.

Actual result: {CENTRAL} slows down and consumes a lot of resources. In a {OPENSHIFT} environment, the pod eventually fails.

Workaround: Restart all {CENTRAL} nodes. To avoid this issue, do not enable multi-project import.

.If you migrate a process from the legacy process designer to the new process designer, you receive an incorrect warning that a node will be ignored [https://issues.jboss.org/browse/RHPAM-2452[RHPAM-2452]]

Issue:  If you migrate a process from the legacy process designer to the new process designer, you receive a warning that a node will be ignored. However, the node is not ignored and is migrated successfully.

Steps to reproduce:

. Create a Start to End process in the legacy process designer.
. Migrate the process to the new process designer.

Expected result: No warning about ignoring elements are shown if no elements will be ignored after migration.

Actual result: Warnings are shown that some unknown element will be ignored.

Workaround: Ignore the warnings and confirm that all nodes migrate successfully.

//approved
.In the new process designer, the warning message for migrating a `Group` element is missing [https://issues.jboss.org/browse/RHPAM-2454[RHPAM-2454]]

Issue: If you migrate a process that contains a `Group` element from the legacy process designer to the new process designer, the warning message about ignoring the node is missing.

Steps to reproduce:

. Create a process in the legacy process designer.
. Add a `Group` element to the process and then save the process.
. Migrate the process from the legacy process designer to the new process designer.

Expected result: You see a warning message about ignoring the node.

Actual result: You do not see the warning message.

Workaround: None.

//approved
.In the new process designer, some end events have incorrect icons [https://issues.jboss.org/browse/RHPAM-2413[RHPAM-2413]]

Issue:

Steps to reproduce:

. Open the Business Automation Operator UI.
. Assign values to mandatory parameters.
. Retain the authentication mode `Internal`.
. Complete the role properties file configuration.
. Deploy the result.

Expected result: When internal authentication is used, it is not possible to specify the role properties file.

Actual result: When internal authentication is used, it is possible to specify the role properties file.


Workaround: If you plan to use internal authentication, leave the role properties file property in Business Automation Operator UI empty.


.Resource requests have an incorrect name in the customer resource (CR) YAML file [https://issues.jboss.org/browse/RHPAM-2248[RHPAM-2248]]

Issue: Resource requests are specified as `request` in the Business Automation Operator UI, however in the customer resource definition (CRD) they are specified as `requests`. Therefore, CPU and memory requests from the UI are not applied.

NOTE: This issue is resolved with {PRODUCT} patch release 7.5.1.

Steps to reproduce:

. Open the Business Automation Operator UI.
. Assign values to mandatory parameters.
. Complete CPU and memory requests for Console.
. Check the resulting YAML file.

Expected result: In the generated YAML file, resource requests are specified as `requests`.

Actual result: In the generated YAML file, resource requests are specified as `request`.

Workaround: In the generated YAML file, change the resource request specification from `request` to `requests`.

.Product environment fails to deploy on Amazon Web Services (AWS) with AWS Elastic Block Storage (EBS) because of AWS EBS volume plugin lack of support for `ReadWriteMany` (`RWX`) persistent volume access mode [https://issues.jboss.org/browse/RHPAM-2480[RHPAM-2480]]

Issue: Several templates used for installing {PRODUCT} on {OPENSHIFT}, as well as deployment of several environment types using the Business Automation Operator, fail to deploy on AWS with EBS. The templates and environment types include persistent volume claims that require support for the `ReadWriteMany` access mode and the AWS EBS volume plugin does not provision persistent volumes with this access mode.
