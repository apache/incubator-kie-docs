[IMPORTANT]
====
These features are for Technology Preview only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs), might not be functionally complete, and Red Hat does not recommend to use them for production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

* New Decision Model and Notation (DMN) designer in {CENTRAL}. You can use the new DMN designer in {CENTRAL} to design DMN decision requirements diagrams (DRDs) and define decision logic for a complete and functional DMN decision model. {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} provides both design and runtime support for DMN 1.2 models at conformance level 3, and includes enhancements and fixes to FEEL and DMN model components to optimize the experience of implementing DMN decision services with {PRODUCT}.

* High-availability authoring on {EAP} (on premise and OpenShift). Configuration of {CENTRAL} for high availability is currently tech preview. Search and messaging technology used to enable search feature is considered an implementation detail. {PRODUCT} may choose to replace that technology in the future while preserving the capability offered.
* Rule units: Represent a declarative approach to partitioning a rule set into smaller units, binding different data sources to those units, and the execution of the individual unit. A rule unit consists of data sources, global variables, and rules.
ifdef::DM[]
* Multithreaded execution: Solves a single data set by partitioning across multiple threads. It is turned off by default and can be enabled either with a KieBaseConfiguration option or with a system property as explained in the http://docs.jboss.org/drools/release/7.5.0.Final/drools-docs/html_single[_Drools Documentation_].
