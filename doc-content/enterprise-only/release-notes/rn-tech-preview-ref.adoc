= Technology preview

This section lists features that are in Technology Preview in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}. {CENTRAL} includes an experimental features administration page that is disabled by default. To enable this page, set the value of the `appformer.experimental.features` property to `true`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
These features are for Technology Preview only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs), might not be functionally complete, and Red Hat does not recommend to use them for production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

For more information on Red Hat Technology Preview features, see https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/[Technology Preview Features Scope].

== Dashbuilder runtime
Dashbuilder runtime is a new add-on standalone web application and it is distributed as a `WAR` to run the dashboards on {EAP}. If you have access to dashbuilder runtime, you can explore the dashboards created in {CENTRAL}. The following list provides a summary of dashbuilder runtime:

* After creating dashboards using datasets and pages, you can export these dashboards from {CENTRAL} using custom export.
* You can import, access, and run the dashboards which are exported from {CENTRAL} in a dashbuilder runtime.
* Dashbuilder runtime accesses the {KIE_SERVER} REST API to run the queries from imported {KIE_SERVER} datasets.

== Case modeler
Case modeler in {CENTRAL} now includes the new process designer. It provides the option to model a case as a sequence of stages so it is simple to define a case model at high-level. Case modeling supports three types of tasks: human tasks, sub-processes, and sub-cases.

[NOTE]
====
The case modeler in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} is a Technology Preview feature and is disabled by default in {CENTRAL}. To enable the case modeler preview in {CENTRAL}, in the upper-right corner of the window click *Settings* -> *Roles*, select a role from the left panel, click *Editors* -> *(New) Case Modeler* -> *Read*, and then click *Save* to save the changes.

== Prediction Service API

You can use the Prediction Service API to provide a prediction service that assists with human tasks. The prediction service can use AI. For example, you can use Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) models or Statistical Machine Intelligence and Learning Engine (SMILE) to implement the service.

== Enhanced search capabilities
{PRODUCT} {ENTERPRISE_VERSION} provides enhanced search capabilities, including flexible search criteria for tasks, process instances, and cases. For more information, see {URL_DESIGNING_CASES}[_{DESIGNING_CASES}_].

== OpenShift operator installer wizard
An installer wizard is provided in the OpenShift operator for {PRODUCT}. You can use the wizard to deploy a {PRODUCT} environment on {OPENSHIFT} with the operator.
