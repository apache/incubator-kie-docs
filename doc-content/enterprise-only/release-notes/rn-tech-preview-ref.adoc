= Technology preview

This section lists features that are in Technology Preview in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}. {CENTRAL} includes an experimental features administration page that is disabled by default. To enable this page, set the value of the `appformer.experimental.features` property to `true`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
These features are for Technology Preview only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs), might not be functionally complete, and Red Hat does not recommend to use them for production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

For more information on Red Hat Technology Preview features, see https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/[Technology Preview Features Scope].

== High-availability authoring on {EAP} (on premise and with {OPENSHIFT})
Configuration of {CENTRAL} for high availability is currently Technology Preview. Search and messaging technology used to enable search feature is considered an implementation detail. That technology may be replaced in {PRODUCT} in the future while the capability offered may be preserved.

== Case modeler
Case modeler in {CENTRAL} now includes the new process designer. It provides the option to model a case as a sequence of stages so it is simple to define a case model at high-level. Case modeling supports three types of tasks: human tasks, sub-processes, and sub-cases.

[NOTE]
====
The case modeler in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} is a Technology Preview feature and is disabled by default in {CENTRAL}. To enable the case modeler preview in {CENTRAL}, in the upper-right corner of the window click *Settings* -> *Roles*, select a role from the left panel, click *Editors* -> *(New) Case Modeler* -> *Read*, and then click *Save* to save the changes.

== Process instance migration as a standalone service
Process instance migration is now available as a standalone service containing a user interface and a back end, and packaged as a Thorntail uber JAR. The process instance migration service enables a user to define the migration between two different process definitions, known as a migration plan. The user can apply the migration plan to the running process instances in a specific {KIE_SERVER}.

For more information about the process instance migration standalone service, see https://github.com/kiegroup/droolsjbpm-integration/tree/master/process-migration-service[Process Instance Migration Service] page in GitHub.

== Prediction Service API

You can use the Prediction Service API to provide a prediction service that assists with human tasks. The prediction service can use AI. For example, you can use Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) models or Statistical Machine Intelligence and Learning Engine (SMILE) to implement the service.

== Constraint Streams API

You can use the Constraint Streams API as an alternative to the Drools Rules Language (DRL) to program incremental score calculations in plain Java 8+. The Constraint Streams API is fast, scalable, and debuggable. You can use any IDE to develop and debug solvers using the Constraint Streams API. It uses deltas that enables the engine to redo only necessary calculations. It also supports justifications, so you can review the reason a solution was reached in order to debug the solver.

== OpenShift operator installer wizard
An installer wizard is provided in the OpenShift Operator for {PRODUCT}. You can use the wizard to deploy a {PRODUCT} environment on {OPENSHIFT} with the Operator.

== Red Hat JBoss Data Grid replaces Elasticsearch

Red Hat JBoss Data Grid replaces Elasticsearch as the distributed highly scaleable full-text search and analytics engine for {PRODUCT}.

Red Hat Data Grid is built from the Infinispan open-source software project and contains indexing capabilities that enable you to store, search, and analyze high volumes of data quickly and in near-real time. In a {PRODUCT} clustered environment, it enables you to perform complex and efficient searches across cluster nodes.


The `ConstraintStreams` API is currently technology preview. It does not cover the full range of {PLANNER} engine capabilities.
