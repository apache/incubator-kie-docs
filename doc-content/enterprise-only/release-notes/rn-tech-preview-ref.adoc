[IMPORTANT]
====
These features are for Technology Preview only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs), might not be functionally complete, and Red Hat does not recommend to use them for production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

For more information on Red Hat Technology Preview features, see https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/[Technology Preview Features Scope].

== Case modeler
Case modeler now provides the option to model a case as a sequence of stages so it is simple to define a case model at high-level. Case modeling supports three types of tasks: human tasks, sub-processes, and sub-cases. 

[NOTE]
