These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

Process instance migration is now available as a standalone service containing a user interface and a back end, and packaged as a Thorntail uber JAR.

The user can apply the migration plan to the running process instances in a specific {KIE_SERVER}.
