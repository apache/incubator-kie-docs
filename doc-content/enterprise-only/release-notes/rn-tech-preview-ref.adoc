====
These features are for Technology Preview only. Technology Preview features
are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs), might
not be functionally complete, and Red Hat does not recommend to use them for
production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features,
enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the
development process.

* High-availability authoring on {EAP} (on premise and OpenShift). Configuration of {CENTRAL} for high availability is currently tech preview. Search and messaging technology used to enable search feature is considered an implementation detail. {PRODUCT} may choose to replace that technology in the future while preserving the capability offered.
* Rule units: Rule units represent a declarative approach to partitioning a rule set into smaller units, binding different data sources to those units, and the execution of the individual unit. A rule unit consists of data sources, global variables, and rules.
ifdef::DM[]
* Multithreaded Execution - Solves a single data set by partitioning across multiple threads. It is turned off by default and can be enabled either with a KieBaseConfiguration option or with a system property as explained in the http://docs.jboss.org/drools/release/7.5.0.Final/drools-docs/html_single/#_multi-threaded_rule_engine[Drools Documentation].
