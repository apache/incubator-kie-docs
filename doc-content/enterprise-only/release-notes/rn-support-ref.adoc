This section highlights supported version updates in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}.

== Platforms transitioning to maintenance support

Support for {PRODUCT} on {WEBSPHERE}, {WEBLOGIC}, {JWS}, and {TOMCAT} is now in the maintenance phase. Red Hat will continue to support {PRODUCT} on these platforms with the following limitations:

* Red Hat will not release new certifications or software functionality.
* Red Hat will release only qualified security patches that have a critical impact and mission-critical bug fix patches.

In the future, Red Hat might direct customers to migrate to new platforms and product components that are compatible with Red Hatâ€™s hybrid cloud strategy.
