This section lists known issues with {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}.

== {CENTRAL}

.In the test scenarios table, `today()` and `now()` functions are not evaluated correctly [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHDM-1816[RHDM-1816]]

Issue: In the test scenarios table, `today()` and `now()` functions are not evaluated correctly. For example, the `string(today())` function should produce output similar to `2021-05-11` but instead it displays a null value.

Steps to reproduce:

Import the `check-today-1.dmn` and `check-today-test-1.scesim` files attached in the [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHDM-1816[RHDM-1816]] issue and check the results.

Workaround: None.

== Form modeler

.When you create and open a form in the form modeler, you receive a recursion handling issue [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHPAM-4107[RHPAM-4107]]

Issue: In the form modeler, when you try to create and open a form, you receive an error message about a recursion handling issue

Steps to reproduce:

. Create a data object called *A1* and enter the field values as *id:String* and *aField:A1*.
. Create a custom form as *Form1* for the *A1* data object.
. Select *aField* and drag it to the canvas and set *Form1* as its nested form.
. Click *Save*.
. Reopen the editor.
+
You receive an error message.

Workaround: None.

== {KOGITO}

.Unable to run the tests for {KOGITO} examples with scenario simulations [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHPAM-4068[RHPAM-4068]]

Issue: It is not possible to run the tests for {KOGITO} examples which contain scenario simulation dependency. The Surefire plugin fails with an exception.

The following two modules in the {KOGITO} examples fail because there is a mismatch of JUnit version dependency:

* `dmn-pmml-quarkus-example`
* `dmn-quarkus-example`

These examples are included in the `sources.zip` and `kogito-quickstarts.zip` files.

Steps to reproduce:

. Download the {KOGITO} examples.
. Execute the `mvn clean install` command for `dmn-quarkus-example` or `dmn-pmml-quarkus-example`.

Workaround: Override the transitive JUnit dependency of `kogito-scenario-simulation` file and use the version `4.13.1.redhat-00001`.



== {KIE_SERVER}

.When you initialize Swagger on WebSphere, you receive an `IllegalArgumentException` error [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHPAM-3949[RHPAM-3949]]

Issue: When you use the {KIE_SERVER} Swagger extension on WebSphere, {KIE_SERVER} is unavailable and it returns the HTTP 500 error with an `IllegalArgumentException` exception.

Steps to reproduce:

. Start {KIE_SERVER} with basic configuration on WebSphere.
. Try to access the `\http://localhost:9080/kie-server/services/rest/server` URL.
+
You receive the HTTP 500 error.

Workaround: Disable Swagger UI by setting the value of the `org.kie.swagger.server.ext.disabled` system property to `true`.

== DMN designer

.Elbow lines for object connections do not work [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHDM-1856[RHDM-1856]]

Issue: You can adjust the DMN connections shape by adding control point to it. However this feature does not work for connections with the text annotation nodes.

Steps to reproduce for {KOGITO}:

. Enter `\http://sandbox.kie.org/#/` in a browser.
. Import the `association.dmn` file attached in the [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHDM-1856[RHDM-1856]] issue.
. In the *Import* field, upload the `association.dmn` file.
. Run the project.

Steps to reproduce for {CENTRAL}:

. Open an existing project or create a new one.
. Import the `association.dmn` file attached in the [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHDM-1856[RHDM-1856]] issue.
. Build the project and observe the results.

Workaround: None.

== {OPENSHIFT}

.When you set the default role variable as `AUTH_LDAP_DEFAULT_ROLE`, {OPENSHIFT} images ignore the LDAP roles [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHPAM-4132[RHPAM-4132]]

Issue: For {OPENSHIFT} images, when you set the LDAP default roles as `AUTH_LDAP_DEFAULT_ROLE`, all the roles from LDAP are ignored and you can not log in to the {CENTRAL} application. But when you do not set the default roles, all the roles from the LDAP are used correctly and you can log in to the {CENTRAL} application.

Steps to reproduce for operator on {OPENSHIFT} 4.x:

. Create a KieApp application and set the default role as follows:
+
[source]
----
spec:
  auth:
    ldap:
      ...
      defaultRole: guest
  ...
----
. Log in to the {CENTRAL}.

Steps to reproduce for templates on {OPENSHIFT} 3.11:

. Create a template.
. Set the `AUTH_LDAP_DEFAULT_ROLE` environment variable as `AUTH_LDAP_DEFAULT_ROLE = "guest"`.
. Log in to the {CENTRAL}.

Workaround for operator on {OPENSHIFT} 4.x: Remove the set `defaultRole: guest` from your KieApp application.

Workaround for templates on {OPENSHIFT} 3.11: Do not set the environment variable as `AUTH_LDAP_DEFAULT_ROLE = "guest"`.

.When the KieApp instance containing one server configuration to pull the image from a given registry, the operator fails to deploy the server and you receive errors [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHPAM-3787[RHPAM-3787]]

Issue: When deploying {PRODUCT} on {OPENSHIFT} using the operator, you can not use a docker image for the {KIE_SERVER} by enabling the *Set KIE Server Image* option and setting the *Kind* value to `DockerImage`. To use a docker image for the {KIE_SERVER}, you must set the image Context, name, and image tag fields from the from the custom registry.

Steps to reproduce:

. Install the operator on {OPENSHIFT} platform.
. Configure one KieApp instance using `DockerImage` image as *Kind* value and provide the image name including the registry name.
. Click *Set KIE Server image*.
. Change the *Kind* value to `DockerImage`, and then provide the image name including the registry name, but without the version tag

Workaround: None.

.Authorization fails while using the role mapping [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHPAM-4146[RHPAM-4146]]

Issue: When you set the `roleMapper`, authorization fails and it is not specified in the `KIELdapSecurityDomain` security-domain.

Workaround:

. Create the `workaround.cli` script as follows:
+
[source]
----
embed-server --std-out=echo --server-config=standalone-openshift.xml
batch

/subsystem=elytron/security-domain=KIELdapSecurityDomain:write-attribute(name=realms[0].role-mapper, value=kie-custom-role-mapper)

run-batch
quit
----

. Create a empty file as `delayedpostconfigure.sh`.
. Create the `postconfigure.sh` file and add the following content:
+
[source]
----
echo "trying to execute /opt/eap/bin/jboss-cli.sh --file=/opt/eap/extensions/workaround.cli "
/opt/eap/bin/jboss-cli.sh --file=/opt/eap/extensions/workaround.cli
echo "END - cli script executed"
----

. Create the `config-map` and add the following content:
+
[source]
----
oc create configmap postconfigure \
  --from-file=workaround.cli=workaround.cli \
  --from-file=delayedpostconfigure.sh=delayedpostconfigure.sh \
  --from-file=postconfigure.sh=postconfigure.sh
----

. To mount the `config-map`, follow the steps mentioned in https://github.com/jboss-container-images/rhpam-7-openshift-image/tree/main/quickstarts/post-configure-example#operator-method[Operator method].

You will receive the following message in the logs during {EAP} startup:

[source]
----
trying to execute /opt/eap/bin/jboss-cli.sh --file=/opt/eap/extensions/workaround.cli

END - cli script executed
----

The security domain is also updated as follows:

[source]
----
<security-domain name="KIELdapSecurityDomain" default-realm="KIELdapRealm" permission-mapper="default-permission-mapper">
          <realm name="KIELdapRealm" role-decoder="from-roles-attribute" role-mapper="kie-custom-role-mapper"/>
        </security-domain>
