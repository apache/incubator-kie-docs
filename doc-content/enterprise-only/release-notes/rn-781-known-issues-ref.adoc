.On {EAP}, the {PRODUCT} installer adds an additional `$` sign in the vaulted password of database user [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHPAM-3148[RHPAM-3148]]

Issue: When you use graphical user interface, installer adds an additional `$` sign in the vaulted password for {KIE_SERVER} data source and connection to the database fails.

Steps to reproduce:

. Install {KIE_SERVER} on {EAP} using graphical user interface.
. Configure data source properties for {KIE_SERVER}.
. Complete the installation and run the container.
+
You receive an error regarding incorrect login credentials on start up in logs.

Expected result: No additional `$` sign in the vaulted password and {KIE_SERVER} is connecting to the database.

Actual result: There is an additional `$` sign in the vaulted password and {KIE_SERVER} is not connecting properly to the database.

Workaround:

. Open the `standalone-full.xml` file in your {EAP} directory.
. Search the following element in your data source definition:
+
[source]
----
<subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:datasources:5.0">
----
. Search for `<security>` element.
+
[source]
----
<password> $${VAULT::datasource.NAME::password::1}</password>
----

. Remove an additional `$` sign in the vaulted password and the datasource element in the `standalone-full.xml` file should look similar to the following:
+
[source]
----
<password> ${VAULT::datasource.NAME::password::1}</password>

Issue: {PRODUCT} installer tries to configure properties for {JWS} when you are auto installing on {EAP}. Automated installer is not checking the conditions and executing {JWS} related steps even though the users are using installation script with {EAP}.

Steps to reproduce:

. Run {PRODUCT} installer with the default options.
. Use {EAP} as an installation container.
. Complete the installation, generate an installation script, and name it as `auto.xml`.
. Clean the used {EAP} container and run the installation again using the generated installation script:

ifdef::PAM[]
+
[source]
----
java -jar rhpam-installer-7.8.x.jar auto.xml -variables rhpam.username=rhbaUser,rhpam.password=bpmsAdmin123$

[source]
----
java -jar rhdm-installer-7.8.x.jar auto.xml -variables rhdm.username=rhbaUser,rhdm.password=bpmsAdmin123$
----

endif::[]

. Run the installed {PRODUCT}.

Expected result: {PRODUCT} installer is not trying setup any {JWS} related properties and installation on {EAP} using automated script succeeds.

Actual result: {PRODUCT} installer tries to setup {JWS} related properties and installation on {EAP} using automated script fails.
