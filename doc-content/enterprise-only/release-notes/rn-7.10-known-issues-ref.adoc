.`structureRef` is missing for message event when creating a process [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHPAM-3437[RHPAM-3437]]

. Add message start event and message end event.
. Configure the message for the nodes.
. Add a new process variable to the process.
. Add a newly created process variable as an input or output of both the nodes.

The generated BPMN file does not contain the `structureRef` for `endMessageType`, as per the following example:
+
[source]
----
<bpmn2:itemDefinition id="endMessageType"/>
<bpmn2:message id="_Icr1JGVqEeuMVv5wG-FCkw" itemRef="endMessageType" name="endMessage"/>
----

Workaround: Perform the same steps in the VSCode editor in desktop, the correct BPMN file is generated as per the following example:
