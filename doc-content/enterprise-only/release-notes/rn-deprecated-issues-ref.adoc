== Unified product deliverable and deprecation of {PRODUCT} distribution files

In Red Hat Process Automation Manager 7.13 release, the distribution files for {PRODUCT} will be replaced with Red Hat Process Automation Manager files. Note that there will not be any change to the {PRODUCT} subscription and the support entitlements and fees will remain the same. {PRODUCT} is a subset of Red Hat Process Automation Manager, and {PRODUCT} subscribers will continue to receive full support for the decision management and optimization capabilities. The business process management (BPM) capabilities are exclusive to Red Hat Process Automation Manager and will be available for use by {PRODUCT} subscribers but with development support services only. {PRODUCT} subscribers can upgrade to a full Red Hat Process Automation Manager subscription at any time to receive full support for BPM features.
