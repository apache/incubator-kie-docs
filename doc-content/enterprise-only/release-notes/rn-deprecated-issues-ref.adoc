The deprecated images and templates are not supported with new features but remain available until the end of {OPENSHIFT} version 3.x support. For more information about the full support lifecycle phase for {OPENSHIFT} version 3.x, see https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift_noncurrent[Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Life Cycle Policy (non-current versions)].

== Legacy process designer
The legacy process designer in {CENTRAL} was deprecated in {PRODUCT} since 7.6.0. The legacy process designer does not receive any new enhancements or features.
