= Deprecated components

The components listed in this section have been deprecated.

==  Legacy Test Scenarios tool
The legacy Test Scenarios tool was deprecated with {PRODUCT} 7.3.0. It will be removed in a future {PRODUCT} release. Use the new Test Scenarios designer instead.

== Support for {OPENSHIFT} 3.x
Since {PRODUCT} version 7.5, images and templates for {OPENSHIFT} 3.x are deprecated. These images and templates do not get new features, but remain supported until the end of full support for {OPENSHIFT} version 3.x. For more information about the full support lifecycle phase for {OPENSHIFT} version 3.x, see https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift_noncurrent[Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Life Cycle Policy (non-current versions)].

Consider deploying {PRODUCT} using the operator on {OPENSHIFT} 4.x.

== Legacy process designer
The legacy process designer in {CENTRAL} is deprecated in {PRODUCT} 7.6.0. The legacy process designer will not receive any new enhancements or features. If you intend to use the new process designer, start migrating your processes to the new designer. Create all new processes in the new process designer. For information about migrating projects to the new designer, see {URL_MANAGING_PROJECTS}#migrating-from-legacy-designer-proc[{MANAGING_PROJECTS}].
