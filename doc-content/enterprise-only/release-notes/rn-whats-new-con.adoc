This section highlights new features in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}.

== Installation

== {CENTRAL}

=== Decision Model and Notation (DMN) designer improvements

The Decision Model and Notation (DMN) designer in {CENTRAL} includes the following notable enhancements:

* New *Documentation* tab that you can use to generate a report of your DMN model. You can print or download the report as an HTML file for offline use.
* PMML support in DMN included models. You can now use the *Included Models* tab in the DMN designer to include Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) models from your project in a specified DMN file. When you include a PMML model within a DMN file, you can invoke that PMML model as a boxed function expression for a DMN decision node or business knowledge model node.
* Support for JPMML execution of PMML models included in DMN models. For PMML models that you include in DMN models, you can use either the `kie-pmml` compiler or the full PMML specification implementation with the Java Evaluator API for PMML (JPMML) for PMML execution.
+
IMPORTANT: Red Hat supports integration with the Java Evaluator API for PMML (JPMML) for PMML execution in {PRODUCT}. However, Red Hat does not support the JPMML libraries directly. If you include JPMML libraries in your {PRODUCT} distribution, see the https://openscoring.io/[Openscoring.io] licensing terms for JPMML.

For more information about DMN support in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}, see the following resources:

=== Ability to convert a guided decision table to a spreadsheet decision table

You can convert a guided decision table in {CENTRAL} to an XLS spreadsheet decision table file for offline reference and file sharing. The guided decision table must be an extended entry guided decision table in order to be converted. The conversion tool does not support limited entry guided decision tables. To convert a guided decision table, navigate to the guided decision table asset that you want to convert and in the upper-right toolbar of the guided decision tables designer, click *Convert to XLS*.

WARNING: Guided decision tables and spreadsheet decision tables are different decision table formats that support different features. Any supported features that differ between the two decision table formats are modified or lost when you convert one decision table format to the other.

=== Bulk reassignment supported for tasks in {CENTRAL}

In the *Task Inbox* and *Tasks* pages in {CENTRAL}, you can now perform bulk reassignment over multiple tasks in a single operation.

To reassign tasks in bulk:
. Select two or more tasks, click the *Bulk Actions* drop-down menu in the upper-right corner of the window, and select *Bulk Reassign*.
. When prompted, enter the user ID of the user to whom you want to reassign the tasks and click *Delegate*. For each task selected, a notification is displayed showing the reassignment result.

=== Bulk actions supported for tasks in {CENTRAL}

In the  *Task Inbox* and *Tasks* pages in {CENTRAL}, you can now perform bulk actions over multiple tasks in a single operation. To update tasks in bulk, select two or more tasks, click the *Bulk Actions* drop-down menu in the upper-right corner of the window, and select one of the following bulk actions:

* *Bulk Claim*
* *Bulk Release*
* *Bulk Resume*
* *Bulk Suspend*

If a specified bulk action is not permitted based on the task status, a notification is displayed and the operation is not executed on that task.

=== Import and export Dashbuilder data in {CENTRAL}

You can now import and export Dashbuilder data as ZIP files. To export or import Dashbuilder data, select the *Admin* icon in the upper-right corner of the {CENTRAL} window and select *Dashbuilder Data Transfer*.

=== Process designer
The following list provides a summary of process designer updates:

* Support for feature parity when you migrate legacy business processes to the new process designer
* Support for designer parser round-trip for unsupported elements, such as importing models exported by ARIS BPM diagrams, even if they contain elements that are not supported by {PRODUCT}.
* A new text annotation BPMN2 element that enables you to retain existing text annotations when you port external processes to the new process designer
* Support for ISO8601 expressions for user task notifications.

=== Test scenarios

The test scenarios designer in {CENTRAL} is now available with the new features supported in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}.

*  View coverage reports for rule-based models. The test scenarios designer displays the test coverage statistics in the *Coverage Report* panel on the right side of the test scenarios designer.

* Download coverage reports for rule-based and DMN-based models. You can now download the test scenario coverage reports in CSV format.

* You can run test scenarios with stateless KIE sessions. To configure a stateless KIE session, expand the *Settings* panel of the test scenario and select or clear the *Stateless Session* check box to indicate whether or not the KIE session is stateless or not.

NOTE: The test scenario 'scesim' file format is not public. You can only edit the 'scesim' file using the test scenario editor.
