= New features

This section highlights new features in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}.

== Ability to send cookies in the REST work item handler

You can now send cookies to the REST work item handler using the `Cookie` header and cookie parameters in a REST API as shown in the following example:

`cookieParam1=cookieParam1_Value;cookieParam2=cookieParam2_Value`

You can also define the path for which the cookie is valid using the `CookiePath` header. By default, the value of `CookiePath` is set to `/`.

== Support for the general NPM registry for standalone editors

You can now use the general NPM registry to install the standalone editors including BPMN and DMN editors. For more information about standalone editors, see {URL_DEVELOPING_PROCESS_SERVICES}#assembly-designing-business-processes[_{DESIGNING_BUSINESS_PROCESSES}_] and for more information about the NPM registry, see https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kogito-tooling/kie-editors-standalone.

== Ability to see instance badges in the SVG file

You can now also see instance badges in the SVG file, which is returned from the `GET/server/containers/{containerId}/images/processes/{processId}` endpoint.

== Support for claiming tasks in bulk using a REST endpoint

You can now claim tasks in bulk using a REST endpoint. To claim tasks in bulk, you must pass the task ID of all tasks as a query parameter. For more information, see {URL_DEPLOYING_AND_MANAGING_SERVICES}#assembly-kie-apis[_{KIE_APIS}_].

== Migration of a standalone process instance migration service to {QUARKUS}

It is now possible to migrate a standalone process instance migration service to {QUARKUS}  2.2.0.

== Distance-based clustering model in PMML

{PRODUCT} now includes consumer conformance support for the distance-based clustering model in PMML. You can now integrate clustering models with your decision services in {PRODUCT}.  For more information about clustering models, see
{URL_DEVELOPING_DECISION_SERVICES}#assembly-pmml-models[_{PMML_MODELS}_].

== File-based user data storage

{PRODUCT} can now store the user data in sets of files instead sets of properties. File-based storage provides several extra features, such as SSH login and a user maintenance UI.

== {KIE_SERVER}

=== Support for adding a request identifier to the JMS header

A new {KIE_SERVER} system property, `org.kie.executor.jms.jobHeader`, was added to {PRODUCT}. If the value of this property is set to `true`, the `jobId` JMS header property will contain the request identifier.

For a list of {KIE_SERVER} system properties, see {URL_MANAGING_SETTINGS}#kie-server-system-properties-ref_execution-server[_{MANAGING_KIE_SERVER}_].

== Process Designer

=== Process designer updates
The following list provides a summary of process designer updates:

* The ability to edit the names of the new nodes automatically
* The ability to add orthogonal polylines to connect two nodes
* The ability to reuse data types across other elements of a business process, such as process variables and task input or output data
* The ability to add metadata attributes to all nodes and events

For more information, see {URL_DEVELOPING_PROCESS_SERVICES}#assembly-designing-business-processes[_{DESIGNING_BUSINESS_PROCESSES}_].

=== Support for automated mapping with DMN

When a DMN model is invoked from a business rule task in a BPMN workflow, the output is automatically mapped with the DMN model and returns an object of the type that is defined in the DMN model.

=== Support for line splicing in the BPMN editor

In the BPMN editor, if two nodes are connected with a sequence flow and another node is dragged and dropped over the same sequence flow, then a new sequence flow is created to perform the correct connection assignments.

== {PROCESS_ENGINE_CAP}

=== New custom query for human tasks with administration data

The KIE API includes the new `jbpmHumanTasksWithAdminExtended` custom query. This query provides a list of all human task instances on the {KIE_SERVER} instance. This list includes the administrator user responsible for the task, as well as extended information about the task, such as the user that modified the task most recently.

For more information about custom queries in the KIE API, see {URL_DEPLOYING_AND_MANAGING_SERVICES}#kie-server-rest-api-custom-queries-endpoints-con_kie-apis[_{KIE_APIS}_].

=== Configuration file for Smart Router

You can now use a configuration file to configure Smart Router instead of providing parameters in the command line.

For more information about configuring Smart Router using a configuration file, see {URL_INSTALLING_AND_CONFIGURING}#smart-router-config-file-proc_clustering-runtime-standalone[_{INSTALLING_ON_EAP_CLUSTER}_].

=== Sending headers in Web Service custom tasks

You can now use the Web Service custom task to send a request including custom information in Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) headers.

For more information about custom tasks, see {URL_DEVELOPING_PROCESS_SERVICES}#assembly-custom-tasks-and-work-item-handlers[_{CUSTOM_TASKS_AND_HANDLERS}_].

=== Send Task event handler included by default

Processes developed in {CENTRAL} now include the Send Task event handler by default. When creating processes that interact with {KAFKA_PRODUCT}, you no longer need to add this event handler manually.

For more information about creating processes that interact with {KAFKA_PRODUCT}, see {URL_INTEGRATING}#assembly-integrating-amq-streams[_{INTEGRATING_AMQ_STREAMS}_].

== {PLANNER}

=== OptaPlanner quickstarts

The following quickstarts are included in the  {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION_LONG} Kogito and OptaPlanner 8 Decision Services Quickstarts  download (`{PRODUCT_INIT}-{PRODUCT_VERSION_LONG}-kogito-and-optaplanner-quickstarts.zip`):

* `optaplanner-quickstarts-{OPTAPLANNER_BOM_VERSION}/hello-world`

* `optaplanner-quickstarts-{OPTAPLANNER_BOM_VERSION}/technology`
** `java-activemq-quarkus`

=== Micrometer with OptaPlanner

{PLANNER} exposes metrics through Micrometer, a metrics instrumentation library for Java applications. You can use Micrometer with popular monitoring systems to monitor the OptaPlanner solver. For information about using Micrometer with OptaPlanner, see {URL_DEVELOPING_SOLVERS}[_Developing Solvers with {PRODUCT}_].

== {OPENSHIFT}

ifdef::PAM[]

=== Process Instance Migration Service now uses Quarkus
Process Instance Migration Service now uses Quarkus instead of Thorntail.

endif::PAM[]

=== Configurable startup strategy when using the Operator installer

When you deploy {PRODUCT} on {OPENSHIFT} using the operator installer, by default the deployment uses the `OpenShiftStartupStrategy` setting. You can now switch to the Controller startup strategy in the configuration user interface if necessary.

=== Custom hostname routes
You can now set custom hostnames for external routes by using the `routeHostname` property. 

=== Improved SSL configurability
You can now enable or disable SSL in the operator and expose the SSL route.

=== Default configuration for Cross Domain Resource Sharing (CORS)
You can now specify whether to use a default or user customized CORS configuration.

=== LDAP configuration changes for {OPENSHIFT}

When deploying {PRODUCT} on {OPENSHIFT}, LDAP security configuration now uses the Elytron subsystem. To support the Elytron subsystem, the following configuration settings were removed:

* `AUTH_ROLE_MAPPER_REPLACE_ROLE`
* `AUTH_LDAP_DISTINGUISHED_NAME_ATTRIBUTE`
* `AUTH_LDAP_JAAS_SECURITY_DOMAIN`
* `AUTH_LDAP_USERNAME_BEGIN_STRING`
* `AUTH_LDAP_USERNAME_END_STRING`
* `AUTH_LDAP_PARSE_ROLE_NAME_FROM_DN`
* `AUTH_LDAP_PARSE_USERNAME`
* `AUTH_LDAP_REFERRAL_USER_ATTRIBUTE_ID_TO_CHECK`
* `AUTH_LDAP_ROLE_ATTRIBUTE_IS_DN`
* `AUTH_LDAP_ROLE_NAME_ATTRIBUTE_ID`

The following configuration settings were added:

* `LDAP_AUTH_RECURSIVE_SEARCH`
* `AUTH_LDAP_MAPPER_KEEP_MAPPED`
* `AUTH_LDAP_MAPPER_KEEP_NON_MAPPED`
* `AUTH_LDAP_REFERRAL_MODE`
* `LDAP_AUTH_NEW_IDENTITY_ATTRIBUTES`
* `AUTH_LDAP_LOGIN_FAILOVER`

=== {DATAGRID} user name and password configuration on {OPENSHIFT}

When deploying a high-availability {PRODUCT} environment on {OPENSHIFT}, you can now configure the user name and password for the {DATAGRID} component.

=== Post-configuration scripts for {OPENSHIFT}

When deploying {PRODUCT} on {OPENSHIFT}, running post-configuration scripts on {EAP} on the {CENTRAL} and {KIE_SERVER} pods is now supported. You can use these scripts to configure Elytron users.

=== Role mapping configuration for {OPENSHIFT} without a file

When deploying {PRODUCT} on {OPENSHIFT}, you can now configure role mapping for {RH-SSO} or LDAP configuration by entering the configuration directly in the settings, without using a role mapping configuration file. The use of a role mapping configuration file is now optional but still supported.
