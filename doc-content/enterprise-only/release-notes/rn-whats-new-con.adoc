= New features

This section highlights new features in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}.

== Installation
=== Manifest of dependencies for an unconnected deployment

{PRODUCT} now includes a manifest file with all of the Maven artifact dependencies required for operation, including development of services in {CENTRAL}. You can download the artifacts and provide them in a mirror repository in order to use {PRODUCT} without an outgoing connection to the public Internet.


== {CENTRAL}

=== Git branch cloning
{CENTRAL} now supports cloning specific branches from remote repositories.

=== Role-based access control
{CENTRAL} now supports role-based access control for branches. Users can restrict access for a target branch to a specified collaborator. For example, if a user has security permission to update a project and has write permission for that branch based on the specified contributor type, the user can create new assets.

=== Test Scenarios

You can complete the following tasks in the test scenarios designer:

* Run a single test scenario.
You can now run a single test scenario in the test scenarios table.

* Run all test scenarios at the project level.
In the project view, you can now concurrently run all of the available test scenarios defined inside a single project.

* View coverage reports for DMN models.
The test scenarios designer displays the test coverage statistics in the *Coverage Report* panel on the right side of the test scenarios designer.

* Export and import test scenario spreadsheet data.
You can now export and import test scenario spreadsheet data in CSV format.

* View failed test results.
If a test fails, the test scenarios designer now displays a pop-up window with a detailed error message and actual values of the test results.

* Test a ruleflow group.
You can set a specific ruleflow group or agenda group in the *Settings* panel on the right side of the designer.

=== Process designer
The following list provides a summary of process designer updates:

* {CENTRAL} provides more detailed error messages, highlights errors in diagrams, and lists all validation errors that a user needs to know about in order to fix issues in the process model.
* The new process designer in {CENTRAL} supports text wrapping inside of nodes. If you resize a node, the text automatically resizes and wraps inside the node.
* You can now choose an execution mode in multi-instance human tasks and subprocesses and sequential and parallel execution of the instances.

* There is added support for the following new advanced user task properties:
** Notifications:
*** Type = Not Started, Not Completed
*** Expires At
*** From
*** To Users
*** To Groups
*** Reply To
*** Subject
*** Body

** Reassignments:
*** Users
*** Groups
*** Expires At
*** Type = Not Started, Not Completed

* You can now track a Service Level Agreement (SLA) based on the due date that is set either for the entire process instance or selected activities.

* You can now import processes with `childLaneSets`, which are transformed to regular swim lanes during the import process.

* You can now import processes with a collapsed subprocess. This ability enables users to import large process diagrams that contain collapsed subprocesses.

* Zoom and panning capabilities in the new process designer are improved, including zooming (Ctrl) and panning (Alt) keyboard shortcuts.

[NOTE]
====
The legacy process designer in {CENTRAL} is deprecated with {PRODUCT} 7.4.0. It will be removed in a future {PRODUCT} release. The legacy process designer will not receive any new enhancements or features. If you intend to use the new process designer, start migrating your processes to the new designer. Create all new processes in the new process designer. For information about migrating to the new designer, see see {URL_MANAGING_PROJECTS}#migrating-from-legacy-designer-proc[_{MANAGING_PROJECTS}_].

=== Default filter selection
You can use the *Saved Filter* option on the following pages to set a task filter as the default filter:

* *Process Instances*
* *Execution Errors*
* *Jobs*
* *Tasks*
* *Task Inbox*

The default filter is then applied each time you open the page.

=== Prometheus metrics monitoring in {PRODUCT}

{KIE_SERVER} now supports Prometheus metrics monitoring for your business assets in {PRODUCT}. Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring toolkit that you can use with {PRODUCT} to collect and store metrics related to the execution of business rules, processes, solvers, Decision Model and Notation (DMN) models, and other assets in {PRODUCT}. You can access the stored metrics through a REST API call to the {KIE_SERVER}, through the Prometheus expression browser, or using a data-graphing tool such as Grafana.

You can configure Prometheus metrics monitoring for an on-premise {KIE_SERVER} instance, for {KIE_SERVER} on Spring Boot, or for a {KIE_SERVER} deployment on {OPENSHIFT}.

For information about enabling and using Prometheus metrics monitoring with {PRODUCT}, see {URL_MANAGING_KIE_SERVER}#prometheus-monitoring-con_execution-server[_{MANAGING_KIE_SERVER}_].

=== DMN included models

The Decision Model and Notation (DMN) designer contains a new *Included Models* tab that you can use to include other DMN models from your project in a specified DMN file. When you include a DMN model within another DMN file, you can reuse the DRD nodes and logic of the included model in that DMN file. This enhancement helps you more efficiently integrate DMN logic between different DMN models in your project.

For more information about DMN support in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}, see the following resources:

* {URL_DMN_MODELS}[_{DMN_MODELS}_]
* {URL_GETTING_STARTED_DECISION_SERVICE}[_{GETTING_STARTED_DECISION_SERVICE}_]


== {OPENSHIFT}

=== JMS capabilities for {KIE_SERVER}
JMS capabilities for {KIE_SERVER} are now available. With JMS capabilities you can interact with the server through the JMS API using an external AMQ message broker.

=== {CENTRAL} extensions for OpenShift and OpenShift Startup Strategy for {KIE_SERVER}

All deployments of {PRODUCT} on
ifdef::DM[]
{OPENSHIFT}
endif::DM[]
ifdef::PAM[]
{OPENSHIFT}, except the fixed managed template (`{PRODUCT_INIT}{ENTERPRISE_VERSION_SHORT}-prod.yaml`),
endif::PAM[]
now use OpenShift Startup Strategy for all {KIE_SERVERS} by default (the `KIE_SERVER_STARTUP_STRATEGY` environment variable) and also have the {CENTRAL} extension for OpenShift enabled (the `KIE_WORKBENCH_CONTROLLER_OPENSHIFT_ENABLED` environment variable). These features enable {CENTRAL}
ifdef::PAM[]
and {CENTRAL}
Monitoring
endif::PAM[]
to discover all {KIE_SERVERS} in the same name space automatically. They eliminate the need to configure a controller.

=== Full support for {OPENSHIFT} 4.x in OpenShift Operator

The OpenShift Operator supplied with {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} fully supports OpenShift 4.x.

=== {OPENSHIFT} images use Red Hat Entreprise Linux 8 and OpenJDK 11
{PRODUCT} container images for {OPENSHIFT} now use a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 base layer and OpenJDK 11.

== {PLANNER}

=== Enhancement to Java API

The {PLANNER} Java API supports a more fluent form because of new `with*` methods:

[source,java]

solverFactory.getSolverConfig().withTerminationConfig(
new TerminationConfig().withMinutesSpentLimit(userInput));

=== Contracts supported in Employee Rostering application

In the Employee Rostering starter application for {PLANNER}, you can set the work time limitations stipulated by employee contracts to a day, a week, a month, and a year.
