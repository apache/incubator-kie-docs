=== New development mode and project deployment enhancements for {KIE_SERVER}
You can now set {KIE_SERVER} to run in `production` mode, formerly the default setting, or in `development` mode, the new default setting. Development mode provides a flexible deployment policy that enables you to update existing deployment units (KIE containers) while maintaining active process instances for small changes, or to reset the deployment unit state before updating active process instances for bigger changes. Production mode is optimal for production environments, where each deployment creates a new deployment unit, as in previous releases.
 
Along with this improvement, {CENTRAL} also includes new *Build & Install* and *Redeploy* options for building and deploying projects. In a production or development environment, you can select the *Build & Install* option to build the project and publish the KJAR file to the configured Maven repository without deploying to a {KIE_SERVER}. This option is equivalent to running `mvn clean install` for your project in the command terminal. In a development environment, you can click *Deploy* to deploy the built KJAR file to a {KIE_SERVER} without aborting any running instances (if applicable), or click *Redeploy* to deploy the built KJAR file and abort any running instances. In a production environment, the *Redeploy* option is disabled and you can click *Deploy* only to deploy the built KJAR file to a new deployment unit (KIE container) on a {KIE_SERVER}.
 
To disable or enable development mode in {CENTRAL}, go to project *Settings* -> *General Settings* -> *Version* and toggle the *Development Mode* option. Do not use *Development Mode* or manually add the `SNAPSHOT` version suffix for a production environment. You can select the KIE Server mode by setting the system property `org.kie.server.mode` to `production` or `development` (default).

== Integration
=== Fuse Integration
Fuse 7 integration with {PRODUCT} is now fully supported on Apache Karaf. Use remote APIs and the `kie-camel` component for {KIE_SERVER} integration. See the COMMENT: FUSE story link.

=== Spring Boot 2.1.x
{PRODUCT} support for Spring Boot has been updated from Spring Boot 1.5.x to Spring Boot 2.1.x.

== Decision engine
=== Java 11
Java 11 is certified on core engines and tooling, including OpenJDK, JDK 11, and Jigsaw.

== Minor enhancements
* Ability to set the `drools.trimCellsInDTable` system property to `false` in a {PRODUCT} distribution to retain intentional white space before or after values in decision table cells. [https://issues.jboss.org/browse/BAPL-1096[BAPL-1096]]
* New domain specific language (DSL) and fact type search filter when adding conditions or actions to guided rules and guided rule templates. [https://issues.jboss.org/browse/BAPL-1181[BAPL-1181]]
