= New features

This section highlights new features in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}.


== {CENTRAL}

ifdef::DM[]
=== Decision Central renamed to Business Central
 
Decision Central has been renamed to Business Central to improve consistency between {PRODUCT_DM} and {PRODUCT_PAM}. However, all {PRODUCT_DM} file names and URL components remain unchanged to prevent impact on existing {PRODUCT_DM} distributions. For example, the {CENTRAL} URL in {PRODUCT_DM} continues to be `\http://HOST:PORT/decision-central`.
endif::[]

=== New development mode and project deployment enhancements for {KIE_SERVER}
You can now set {KIE_SERVER} to run in `production` mode, formerly the default setting, or in `development` mode, the new default setting. Development mode provides a flexible deployment policy that enables you to update existing deployment units (KIE containers) while maintaining active process instances for small changes, or to reset the deployment unit state before updating active process instances for bigger changes. Production mode is optimal for production environments, where each deployment creates a new deployment unit, as in previous releases.
 
Along with this improvement, {CENTRAL} also includes new *Build & Install* and *Redeploy* options for building and deploying projects. In a production or development environment, you can select the *Build & Install* option to build the project and publish the KJAR file to the configured Maven repository without deploying to a {KIE_SERVER}. This option is equivalent to running `mvn clean install` for your project in the command terminal. In a development environment, you can click *Deploy* to deploy the built KJAR file to a {KIE_SERVER} without aborting any running instances (if applicable), or click *Redeploy* to deploy the built KJAR file and abort any running instances. In a production environment, the *Redeploy* option is disabled and you can click *Deploy* only to deploy the built KJAR file to a new deployment unit (KIE container) on a {KIE_SERVER}.
 
To disable or enable development mode in {CENTRAL}, go to project *Settings* -> *General Settings* -> *Version* and toggle the *Development Mode* option. Do not use *Development Mode* or manually add the `SNAPSHOT` version suffix for a production environment. You can also select the {KIE_SERVER} mode by setting the system property `org.kie.server.mode` to `production` or `development` (default).


ifdef::PAM[]
=== C3 Charts Library
 
The https://c3js.org/[C3] Chart library replaces the Google Charts library as the default chart library in {CENTRAL}. With this improvement, supported chart types can be rendered in the *Process & Task* dashboard in an offline environment.
 
Along with this improvement, the following two new system properties are available:
 
* `org.dashbuilder.renderer.default`: You can set which renderer you want to use as the default. The two possible values are `c3` and `gwtcharts`. The current default  is `c3`. If you select `c3`, the C3 Chart library is used for supported chart types. The missing map type will still use the Google Charts library. If you select `gwtcharts`, the Google Charts library is used for supported chart types.
 
* `org.dashbuilder.renderer.offline`: This is a boolean property. When true, the property excludes all APIs that do not work offline and their supported chart types are not available for use. You can use this to hide the maps displayer when creating pages. Pages that already use the map displayer will show an error.
endif::PAM[]
=== GIT hook execution handling
 
GIT hook execution handling now includes UI notifications to indicate if a script is executed successfully or with a warning or error.
 

ifdef::PAM[]
=== Service task repository integrated with {CENTRAL}
 
The {PRODUCT} service task repository (work item repository) is now integrated in {CENTRAL} so that you can add and manage service tasks across multiple business processes or across all projects in {CENTRAL}. {PRODUCT} provides a set of service tasks within the service task repository in {CENTRAL}. You can enable or disable the default service tasks and upload custom service tasks into {CENTRAL} to implement the tasks in the relevant processes.
 
To configure service tasks and service task settings globally across {CENTRAL}, select the *Admin* icon in the top-right corner of the screen and select *Service Tasks Administration*.
 
//.Enable service tasks and service task settings
//image::admin-and-config/manage-service-tasks.png[Service Tasks Administration page]
 
To apply the enabled service tasks to processes in a project, navigate to a project in {CENTRAL} and go to project *Settings* -> *Service Tasks*.
 
//.Install service tasks for use in processes
//image::admin-and-config/manage-service-tasks-project.png[Project-level service task settings]
 
For more information about about managing service tasks in {CENTRAL}, see {URL_MANAGING_PROCESSES}#manage-service-tasks-proc[_{MANAGING_PROCESSES}_].
 
=== Process documentation accessible in process designer
 
The process designer in {CENTRAL} now provides a *Documentation* tab that summarizes the components, data, and visual flow of the process in a format (PDF) that you can print and share more easily.
 
//.Process documentation
//image::processes/generate-process-docs.png[Project-level service task settings]

=== Process instance administration

Process instance administration supports operations relating to the {PROCESS_ENGINE} and individual process instances. Supported operations:

* Retrieve process nodes using the process instance ID. Returns all nodes, including embedded subprocesses, that exist in a specific process instance. 
* Cancel a node instance using the process instance ID and node instance ID. Cancels a specific node instance within a process instance.
* Re-trigger a node instance using the process instance ID and node instance ID. First cancel the active node instance and then create a new instance of the same type, which recreates the node instance.
* Update the timer using the process instance ID and timer ID. Updates the timer expiration of an active timer. For example, a case timer was initially created with a delay of one hour. After 30 minutes, you want to update the delay to two hours. The case time will then expire in 1.5 hours from the time that it was updated. You can update the following times:
** Delay - The duration after the timer expires.
** Period - The interval between timer expiration. This applies only to cycle timers.
** Repeat limit - Limits the expiration to a specific number. This applies only to cycle timers.
** Update timer relative to current time using the process instance ID and timer ID. This option is similar to the update timer option, but the update is relative to the current time. For example, if a case timer was initially created with a delay of one hour and after 30 minutes you decide to update the delay to two hours, the delay will then expire two hours from the time that it was updated.
* List timer instances using the process instance ID. Returns all active timers found for a specific process instance.
* Trigger a node using the process instance ID and node ID. Enables you to trigger any node in a process instance at any time.

=== Enhanced task instance log view
The task instance log view now contains filtering capabilities that enable you to narrow down the timeline results according to your needs. There are now two new filter categories that enable you to filter process instances based on event types. These include either node entered, node completed, or process nodes such as human tasks, and start and end nodes. 

=== Authoring collaboration
Authoring collaboration enables users to configure the contributors or a project or space and their role (`owner`, `admin`, or `contributor`) with associated privileges. 

== {PLANNER}
=== Deployment of the Employee Rostering starter application on OpenShift

You can now use a template to deploy the {PLANNER}
Employee Rostering starter application on {OPENSHIFT} with persistent data storage.


== Java 11
=== Java 11 certification
Java 11 is certified on core engines and tooling, including OpenJDK, JDK 11, and Jigsaw. With this release we are including support for OpenJDK on Windows.

ifdef::PAM[]
== {PRODUCT} on {OPENSHIFT}
=== OpenShift startup strategy for freeform deployment

You can now use the new OpenShift startup strategy feature of the {KIE_SERVER} (KIE server) when you deploy {PRODUCT} on {OPENSHIFT}. With this feature, an OpenShift-enabled {CENTRAL} or {CENTRAL} Monitoring discovers {KIE_SERVERS} in the same namespace automatically. You do not need to configure controller settings. This feature provides a freeform deployment architecture, which enables you to easily deploy any number of {KIE_SERVERS}.


== Process designer

* Infinite canvas: Infinite canvas provides the ability to extend the canvas as large as needed for process modeling. 

* Graphical constraint editor: A graphical constraint editor has been added to define constraints without coding and without knowledge of technical terminology. 

* Process designer DMN support: The business rules task has been extended to support invoking Decision Model and Notation (DMN) from a process. 

* Reusable sub-process: A few additional properties were added to the reusable sub-process node that are related to on-entry and on-exit scripts. 

* New process designer properties: The new process designer now supports the executable and globals properties.

* Process Designer support for multi-instance sub-process and task: A multiple instance sub-process or task is a sub-process or task that enables you to execute a contained process segment or task multiple times, once for each element in a collection. 

* Process designer RuleFlow profile: A new profile was introduced in the new process designer so that the palette only contains elements that apply to rule flow use cases targeted in {PRODUCT_DM}. When you switch the configuration in {CENTRAL} administration to the rules and planning profile for {PRODUCT_DM} (rather than the full profile for {PRODUCT_PAM}), the new process designer automatically use the RuleFlow profile. 

* New process designer support for the BPMN resolution attribute: BPMN files that are imported into the new process designer can use this attribute to scale the imported project.

== Spring Boot
=== Spring Boot 2.1.x
{PRODUCT} support for Spring Boot has been updated from Spring Boot 1.5.x to Spring Boot 2.1.x.

== Components moved from technology preview to fully supported
 
=== Decision Model and Notation (DMN) designerSpring Boot


++++++++++++++++++++++++++-
+
The Decision Model and Notation (DMN) designer in {CENTRAL} is now fully supported in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}. You can use the new DMN designer in {CENTRAL} to design DMN decision requirements diagrams (DRDs) and define decision logic for a complete DMN decision model. {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} provides both design and runtime support for DMN 1.2 models at conformance level 3, and includes enhancements and fixes to FEEL and DMN model components to optimize the experience of implementing DMN decision services with {PRODUCT}. 
 
The improved DMN designer also includes the following notable enhancements:
 
* New support for decision service nodes in DRDs
* Automatic layout for imported DRDs
* Improved DMN data types and constraints
* Improved DRD validation when assets are saved or built
 
For more information about DMN support in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}, see the following resources:

* {URL_DMN_MODELS}[_{DMN_MODELS}_]
* {URL_GETTING_STARTED_DECISION_SERVICE}[_{GETTING_STARTED_DECISION_SERVICE}_]

=== Test Scenarios designer
The Test Scenarios designer in {CENTRAL} is now fully supported in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}.
 
* Data object list support: The Test Scenarios designer in {CENTRAL} now supports data object lists in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}. You can now define and test scenarios that include Java collections as inputs (given values) or outputs (expected values). A concrete collection can now be defined as a value of a particular cell. The collections can be created, modified, and removed at any time during the development of a test scenario.
 
* DMN support: The Test Scenarios designer in {CENTRAL} now supports DMN-based test scenario assets in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}. You can now create test scenario assets that are rule-based, to test all rules inside all DRL files within the project, or DMN-based, to test all decisions defined inside one particular DMN file.
 
* Visual test results: The Test Scenarios designer in {CENTRAL} now provides visual test results in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}.
 
== Other enhancements
* Ability to set the `drools.trimCellsInDTable` system property to `false` in a {PRODUCT} distribution to retain intentional white space before or after values in decision table cells. 
* New domain specific language (DSL) and fact type search filter when adding conditions or actions to guided rules and guided rule templates. 
* Ability to include slashes in Git branch names.
ifdef::PAM[]
* jBPM Audit mode (none, JPA, JMS) improved to simplify setup and configuration. In addition, jBPM Audit mode now includes all of the audit logs that span across processes, user tasks, and cases.
