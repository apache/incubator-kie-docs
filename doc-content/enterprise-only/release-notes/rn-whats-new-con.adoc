= New features

This section highlights new features in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}.


== {CENTRAL}

ifdef::DM[]
=== Decision Central renamed to Business Central
 
Decision Central has been renamed to Business Central to improve consistency between {PRODUCT_DM} and {PRODUCT_PAM}. However, all {PRODUCT_DM} file names and URL components remain unchanged to prevent impact on existing {PRODUCT_DM} distributions. For example, the {CENTRAL} URL in {PRODUCT_DM} continues to be `\http://HOST:PORT/decision-central`.
endif::[]

=== New development mode and project deployment enhancements for {KIE_SERVER}
You can now set {KIE_SERVER} to run in `production` mode, formerly the default setting, or in `development` mode, the new default setting. Development mode provides a flexible deployment policy that enables you to update existing deployment units (KIE containers) while maintaining active process instances for small changes, or to reset the deployment unit state before updating active process instances for bigger changes. Production mode is optimal for production environments, where each deployment creates a new deployment unit, as in previous releases.
 
Along with this improvement, {CENTRAL} also includes new *Build & Install* and *Redeploy* options for building and deploying projects. In a production or development environment, you can select the *Build & Install* option to build the project and publish the KJAR file to the configured Maven repository without deploying to a {KIE_SERVER}. This option is equivalent to running `mvn clean install` for your project in the command terminal. In a development environment, you can click *Deploy* to deploy the built KJAR file to a {KIE_SERVER} without aborting any running instances (if applicable), or click *Redeploy* to deploy the built KJAR file and abort any running instances. In a production environment, the *Redeploy* option is disabled and you can click *Deploy* only to deploy the built KJAR file to a new deployment unit (KIE container) on a {KIE_SERVER}.
 
To disable or enable development mode in {CENTRAL}, go to project *Settings* -> *General Settings* -> *Version* and toggle the *Development Mode* option. Do not use *Development Mode* or manually add the `SNAPSHOT` version suffix for a production environment. You can select the KIE Server mode by setting the system property `org.kie.server.mode` to `production` or `development` (default).

=== Service task repository integrated with {CENTRAL}
 
The {PRODUCT} service task repository (work item repository) is now integrated in {CENTRAL} so that you can add and manage service tasks across multiple business processes or across all projects in {CENTRAL}. {PRODUCT} provides a set of service tasks within the service task repository in {CENTRAL}. You can enable or disable the default service tasks and upload custom service tasks into {CENTRAL} to implement the tasks in the relevant processes.
 
To configure service tasks and service task settings globally across {CENTRAL}, select the *Admin* icon in the top-right corner of the screen and select *Service Tasks Administration*.
 
//.Enable service tasks and service task settings
//image::admin-and-config/manage-service-tasks.png[Service Tasks Administration page]
 
To apply the enabled service tasks to processes in a project, navigate to a project in {CENTRAL} and go to project *Settings* -> *Service Tasks*.
 
//.Install service tasks for use in processes
//image::admin-and-config/manage-service-tasks-project.png[Project-level service task settings]
 
For more information about about managing service tasks in {CENTRAL}, see {URL_MANAGING_PROCESSES}#manage-service-tasks-proc[_{MANAGING_PROCESSES}_].
 
=== Process documentation accessible in process designer
 
The process designer in {CENTRAL} now provides a *Documentation* tab that summarizes the components, data, and visual flow of the process in a format (PDF) that you can print and share more easily.

//== Integration
//=== Fuse Integration
//Fuse 7 integration with {PRODUCT} is now fully supported on Apache Karaf. Use remote APIs and the `kie-camel` component for {KIE_SERVER} integration. See the COMMENT: FUSE story link.

//[NOTE]
====
Support for running embedded engines on Karaf is deprecated.
====

=== Spring Boot 2.1.x
{PRODUCT} support for Spring Boot has been updated from Spring Boot 1.5.x to Spring Boot 2.1.x.

== {PLANNER}
=== Deployment of the Employee Rostering starter application on OpenShift

You can now use a template to deploy the {PLANNER}
Employee Rostering starter application on {OPENSHIFT} with persistent data storage.

== Decision engine
=== Java 11
Java 11 is certified on core engines and tooling, including OpenJDK, JDK 11, and Jigsaw.

ifdef::PAM[]
== {PRODUCT} on {OPENSHIFT}
=== OpenShift startup strategy for freeform deployment

You can now use the new OpenShift startup strategy feature of the {KIE_SERVER} (KIE server) when you deploy {PRODUCT} on {OPENSHIFT}. With this feature, an OpenShift-enabled {CENTRAL} or {CENTRAL} Monitoring discovers {KIE_SERVERS} in the same namespace automatically. You do not need to configure controller settings. This feature provides a freeform deployment architecture, which enables you to easily deploy any number of {KIE_SERVERS}.
endif::PAM[]

== Components moved from technology preview to fully supported
 
=== Decision Model and Notation (DMN) designer
The Decision Model and Notation (DMN) designer in {CENTRAL} is now fully supported in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}. You can use the new DMN designer in {CENTRAL} to design DMN decision requirements diagrams (DRDs) and define decision logic for a complete DMN decision model. {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} provides both design and runtime support for DMN 1.2 models at conformance level 3, and includes enhancements and fixes to FEEL and DMN model components to optimize the experience of implementing DMN decision services with {PRODUCT}. 
 
The improved DMN designer also includes the following notable enhancements:
 
* New support for decision service nodes in DRDs
* Automatic layout for imported DRDs
* Improved DMN data types and constraints
* Improved DRD validation when assets are saved or built
 
For more information about DMN support in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}, see the following resources:

* {URL_DMN_MODELS}[_{DMN_MODELS}_]
* {URL_GETTING_STARTED_DECISION_SERVICE}[_{GETTING_STARTED_DECISION_SERVICE}_]

 
== Other enhancements
* Ability to set the `drools.trimCellsInDTable` system property to `false` in a {PRODUCT} distribution to retain intentional white space before or after values in decision table cells. 
* New domain specific language (DSL) and fact type search filter when adding conditions or actions to guided rules and guided rule templates. 
* Ability to include slashes in Git branch names.
