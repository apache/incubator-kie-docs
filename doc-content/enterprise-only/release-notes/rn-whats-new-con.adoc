This section highlights new features in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}.


== {CENTRAL}

=== DMN included models

The Decision Model and Notation (DMN) designer contains a new *Included Models* tab that you can use to include other DMN models from your project in a specified DMN file. When you include a DMN model within another DMN file, you can reuse the DRD nodes and logic of the included model in that DMN file. This enhancement helps you more efficiently integrate DMN logic between different DMN models in your project.

For more information about DMN support in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}, see the following resources:
* {URL_DMN_MODELS}[_{DMN_MODELS}_]
* {URL_GETTING_STARTED_DECISION_SERVICE}[_{GETTING_STARTED_DECISION_SERVICE}_]

=== Test Scenarios

The test scenarios designer in {CENTRAL} is now available with the new features supported in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}.

* Run a single test scenario.
A test scenarios designer now enables you to run only a single test scenario in the test scenarios table.

* Run all test scenarios at project level.
It is now possible to run all the available test scenarios defined inside a single project at once in the project view.

* Coverage reports for DMN models.
The test scenario designer provides a clear and coherent way of displaying the test coverage statistics using the Coverage Report panel on the right side of the test scenarios designer.

* Spreadsheet export and import of test scenarios.
A test scenarios designer provides the ability to export and import test scenario spreadsheets in CSV format.

* Visual test results
In the case of test failure, the test scenarios designer in {CENTRAL} now displays a pop-up window with a detailed error message and actual values of the test results.

* Test scenarios designer support for the RuleFlow group testing.
A new feature is introduced in test scenarios designer that allows you to set a specific ruleflow group or agenda group in the Settings panel on the right side of the designer

== {KIE_SERVER}

=== Prometheus metrics monitoring in {PRODUCT}

{KIE_SERVER} now supports Prometheus metrics monitoring for your business assets in {PRODUCT}. Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring toolkit that you can use with {PRODUCT} to collect and store metrics related to the execution of business rules, processes, solvers, Decision Model and Notation (DMN) models, and other assets in {PRODUCT}. You can access the stored metrics through a REST API call to the {KIE_SERVER}, through the Prometheus expression browser, or using a data-graphing tool such as Grafana.

You can configure Prometheus metrics monitoring for an on-premise {KIE_SERVER} instance, for {KIE_SERVER} on Spring Boot, or for a {KIE_SERVER} deployment on {OPENSHIFT}.

For information about enabling and using Prometheus metrics monitoring with {PRODUCT}, see {URL_MANAGING_KIE_SERVER}#prometheus-monitoring-con_execution-server[_{MANAGING_KIE_SERVER}_].
