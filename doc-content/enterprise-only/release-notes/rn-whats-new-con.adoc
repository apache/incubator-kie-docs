= New features

This section highlights new features in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}.

== Container support
You can install {PRODUCT} on {JWS} {JWS_VERSION_LONG} or later.

You can install {PRODUCT} on {EAP} {EAP_VERSION}.
[NOTE]
====
{EAP} 7.1 is not supported with {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}.
====

== Business application generator
You can use the `http://start.jbpm.org` website to generate a {PRODUCT} business application based on Spring Boot starters. After you create and configure your business application, you can deploy it to an existing service or to the cloud, through OpenShift.

== {CENTRAL}
=== Experimental properties administration page
{CENTRAL} now includes an experimental features administration page which is disabled and hidden by default. When enabled, this page displays a list of some experimental features that are in technology preview. You can enable or disable individual features from this page. To enable the experimental features administration page, set the value of the `appformer.experimental.features` property to `true`.
[NOTE]
====
Some experimental features are enabled by default and might not be listed on the experimental properties administration page.

=== Enhanced process instance logs view
The {CENTRAL} process instance logs view has been enhanced. This view enables you to view all of the log events of a process instance based on a timeline of events. On the timeline, node entered events are highlighted in blue whereas node-entered events are greyed out. By default, log events are displayed in groups of ten. You can now view additional human task node details such as ID, state, and owner.

Furthermore, you can now filter process instance logs by the following categories:

* Event type (such as, Node Entered and Node Completed)
* Event node type (such as, All, Human Tasks, Start Nodes, End Nodes, Action Nodes, Milestones, Sub Processes, Rule Sets, and Work Items)

For more information about process instance logs, see {URL_INTERACTING_PROCESSES_TASKS}[_{INTERACTING_PROCESSES_TASKS}_].
endif::PAM[]

=== Support for SSH Keystore

{PRODUCT} uses the SSH protocol for user authentication. It now has a configurable default SSH keystore (where you can register multiple public keys), extensible APIs (for custom implementations), and support for multiple SSH public keys formats.

For more information about SSH keystore, see {URL_CONFIGURING_CENTRAL}[_{CONFIGURING_CENTRAL}_].

== Process engine
=== Narayana transaction manager
{PRODUCT} now supports DBCP 2 database connection pooling with Narayana transaction manager.

endif::PAM[]

== Decision engine

=== Rule units

{PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} now supports rule units that you can use to partition a rule set into smaller units, bind different data sources to those units, and then execute the individual unit. A rule unit consists of data sources, global variables, and rules.

You can define a rule unit by implementing the `RuleUnit` interface as shown in the following example:

.Example rule unit class
[source,java]
----
package org.mypackage.myunit;

public static class AdultUnit implements RuleUnit {
    private int adultAge;
    private DataSource<Person> persons;

    public AdultUnit( ) { }

    public AdultUnit( DataSource<Person> persons, int age ) {
        this.persons = persons;
        this.age = age;
    }

    // A DataSource of Persons in this rule unit
    public DataSource<Person> getPersons() {
        return persons;
    }

    // A global variable valid in this rule unit
    public int getAdultAge() {
        return adultAge;
    }

    // --- life cycle methods

    @Override
    public void onStart() {
        System.out.println("AdultUnit started.");
    }

    @Override
    public void onEnd() {
        System.out.println("AdultUnit ended.");
    }
}
----

For more information about rule units, see the http://docs.jboss.org/drools/release/latestFinal/drools-docs/html_single/#rule-units-con[Drools Documentation].

=== Multithreaded evaluation in the {DECISION_ENGINE}

In {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}, the {DECISION_ENGINE} can now evaluate more business rules in parallel by dividing the RETE and PHREAK pattern-matching algorithms in independent partitions and evaluating them in parallel.

Multithreaded evaluation is disabled by default in {PRODUCT}. To enable multithreaded evaluation for a parallel KIE base, use one of the following options:

* Enable multithreaded evaluation with `KieBaseConfiguration`:
+
[source]
----
KieServices ks = KieServices.Factory.get();
KieBaseConfiguration kieBaseConf = ks.newKieBaseConfiguration();
kieBaseConf.setOption(MultithreadEvaluationOption.YES);
KieBase kieBase = kieContainer.newKieBase(kieBaseConf);
----

* Enable the multithreaded evaluation system property:
+
[source]
----
drools.multithreadEvaluation = true
----

[WARNING]
====
Rules using queries, salience, or agenda groups are currently not supported by the parallel {DECISION_ENGINE}. If these rule elements are present in the KIE base, the compiler emits a warning and automatically switches back to single-threaded evaluation. However, in some cases, the {DECISION_ENGINE} might not detect the unsupported rule elements and rules might be evaluated incorrectly. For example, the {DECISION_ENGINE} might not detect when rules rely on implicit salience given by rule ordering inside the DRL file, resulting in incorrect evaluation due to the unsupported salience attribute.
====

=== Ability to declaratively set calendars in a KIE session

In {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}, you can now declaratively set one or more calendars on a KIE session through the `kmodule.xml` configuration file, as shown in the following example:

[source,xml]
----
<ksession name="KSession1">
  <calendars>
    <calendar name="monday" type="org.domain.Monday"/>
  </calendars>
</ksession>
----

The type is the name of the class that implements the `org.kie.api.time.Calendar` interface.


== {KIE_SERVER}
ifdef::PAM[]
=== ElasticSearch connector for runtime events
This connector enables you to easily integrate with ElasticSearch to push data from the {KIE_SERVER} and take advantage of the searching capabilities of the ElasticSearch server.

endif::PAM[]
=== Swagger interface for {CONTROLLER} REST API

{PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} provides a Swagger web interface for the {CONTROLLER} REST API. You can use this Swagger interface instead of a standalone REST client or curl utility to interact with your {KIE_SERVER} templates (configurations), {KIE_SERVER} instances (remote servers), and associated KIE containers (deployment units) in {PRODUCT}.

To access the Swagger interface for the {CONTROLLER} REST API, you can either start {CENTRAL}, which contains a built-in {CONTROLLER}, or run the {HEADLESS_CONTROLLER} application and navigate to `\http://SERVER:PORT/CONTROLLER/docs` in a web browser.

Example Swagger URLs:

* `\http://localhost:8080/{URL_COMPONENT_CENTRAL}/docs` (for a {CONTROLLER} in {CENTRAL})
* `\http://localhost:8080/my-controller/docs` (for a {HEADLESS_CONTROLLER})

For more information about the {CONTROLLER} REST API, see {URL_KIE_APIS}[_{KIE_APIS}_].

=== Decision Model and Notation (DMN) models
{PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} provides both design and runtime support for DMN 1.2 models at conformance level 3, and includes enhancements and fixes to FEEL and DMN model components to optimize the experience of implementing DMN decision services with {PRODUCT}. You can design your DMN models directly in {CENTRAL} or import existing DMN models into your {PRODUCT} projects for deployment and execution.

For more information about DMN support in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}, see {URL_DMN_MODELS}[_{DMN_MODELS}_].

=== Executable models in Decision Model and Notation (DMN) projects
In {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}, you can now use the `kie-maven-plugin` build component to generate DMN executable model classes and compile them in a {PRODUCT} project (KJAR file). DMN executable model classes are similar to executable rule models used for rule assets. This support enables DMN decision table logic in DMN projects to be evaluated more efficiently.

To enable executable models in DMN projects, add the required `kie-dmn-core` dependency in the `pom.xml` file:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.kie</groupId>
  <artifactId>kie-dmn-core</artifactId>
  <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
----

To build a DMN project with DMN model compilation enabled, navigate to your Maven project directory in a command terminal and run the following command:

[source]
----
mvn clean install -DgenerateDMNModel=YES
----

Alternatively, you can define the DMN model property directly in the `pom.xml` file:

[source,xml]
----
<project>
  ...
  <properties>
    <generateDMNModel>YES</generateDMNModel>
  </properties>
  ...
</project>
----

For more information about configuring executable models for your Maven or Java project, see {URL_PACKAGING_DEPLOYING_PROJECT}#project-build-deploy-maven-proc_packaging-deploying[_{PACKAGING_DEPLOYING_PROJECT}_].

=== Deactivation of KIE containers on {KIE_SERVER}
You can now deactivate KIE containers on {KIE_SERVER}. This enables you to stop the creation of new process instances from a specified container while enabling you to continue working on existing process instances and tasks. The deactivated container can be activated again. This feature does not require server restarts.

=== {KIE_SERVER} support for rendering forms

New {KIE_SERVER} support for rendering forms enables you to interact with the {KIE_SERVER} to perform the following operations:

* Render process forms: Used to start new instances
* Render case forms: Used to start new case instances, including data and role assignments
* Render user task forms: Used to interact with user tasks, including life cycle operations

Rendered forms include buttons that perform all operations based on context. For example, if a user task is in the `progress` state, you can use the *Stop*, *Release*, *Save*, and *Complete* buttons to interact with the process.

== {PLANNER}
=== Defining weights for constraints

In {PLANNER}, you can now define weights for constraints inside a class marked with the `@ConstraintsConfiguration` annotation. You can assign weights to constraints by the Java or DRL name of the constraint, without needing to modify the code of the constraints.

== OpenShift
=== LDAP role mapping on OpenShift deployments

When deploying {PRODUCT} on {OPENSHIFT}, you can now configure LDAP role mapping.

=== KJAR services in immutable OpenShift deployments
When deploying {PRODUCT} on {OPENSHIFT} in an immutable deployment, you can now create {KIE_SERVERS} that run services from KJAR files, not from source.

=== CORS support in trial deployment on OpenShift
In a trial deployment on {OPENSHIFT}, you can use client-side JavaScript applications, served from a different domain, to access a {KIE_SERVER}.

ifdef::PAM[]


== Process designer

=== Case management properties

The following new properties have been added for case management projects and are related to modeling of case definitions:

* *Ad-hoc*: Supports optional modeling paths that can be recommended to users or automatically triggered by rules. Must be set to `true` to show the case management properties.
* *Case ID Prefix*: Provides the option to add a prefix for case IDs. If no prefix is provided, the case ID defaults to `CASE-XXX` where `XXX` is an automatically generated number.
* *Case File*: Responsible for collecting all data related to a case.
* *Case Roles*: Defines roles and cardinality at the process level.


=== {CENTRAL} compensation events

Process managers use compensation events to roll back the actions that were completed during execution. Exception handling activities associated with the normal activities in a business transaction are triggered by compensation events.

Three types of compensation events are available in {CENTRAL}:

* Intermediate boundary (catch) events: Events that are attached to activities, such as tasks that may cause an exception. These events are then associated with a task that is executed if the boundary event catches a thrown compensation signal.
* Start (catch) events: Events that are used when defining a compensation event subprocess, which requires them in order to be able to catch a (thrown) compensation signal.
* Intermediate or end (throw): Events that are used to throw compensation events. These events often follow decision nodes that determine whether the work flow execution succeeded up to a specific point in the process. If not, the path including the intermediate or end event is selected to trigger compensation for the activities that failed.

=== {CENTRAL} resolution attribute

A new diagram resolution attribute has been added to the {CENTRAL} legacy process designer to enable users to successfully import a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) file and convert it to a Java Business Process Model (jBPM) file while retaining the correct scale. Note that this feature has not been added to the new process designer.

=== Labels on sequence flows

New support for showing the label name for sequence flows coming to and from gateways, nodes, tasks, and end events. You can now click any sequence flow line to view the label name.
