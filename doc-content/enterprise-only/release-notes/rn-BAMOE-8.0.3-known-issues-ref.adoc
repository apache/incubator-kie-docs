.Can't log in to Business Central if SSL is disabled [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHPAM-4464[RHPAM-4464]]

Issue:  SSL is disabled in the {CENTRAL} and {CENTRAL} Monitoring images. If you use these images, you cannot log in to {CENTRAL} because {CENTRAL} now requires that SSL be enabled.

Workaround: Manually customize the {CENTRAL} or {CENTRAL} Monitoring image to remove the `secure` flag from the `web.xml` configuration file.
