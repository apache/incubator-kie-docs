This section lists known issues with {PRODUCT} {ENTERPRISE_VERSION_LONG}.

== {CENTRAL}

.Unable deploy {CENTRAL} using JDK version 11.0.16 [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHPAM-4497[RHPAM-4497]]

Issue: It is not possible to deploy {CENTRAL} using JDK version 11.0.16.

Actual result: It is not possible to deploy {CENTRAL}.

Expected result: It is possible to deploy {CENTRAL} successfully.

Workaround: Use previous JDK versions like 11.0.5 or older.

== Form Modeler

.Date type process variable is empty when the process is started using {CENTRAL} form with the `showTime` set to `false` [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHPAM-4514[RHPAM-4514]]

Issue: When you are using the default form rendering in the {CENTRAL}, and the process variable field has `showTime=false`, the started process instance shows the variable empty. The affected types are `java.time.LocalDateTime`, `java.time.LocalDate`, `java.time.LocalTime`, and `java.util.Date`.

Steps to reproduce:

. Define the process variable with a given type.
. Generate a form.
. Open a form and set `showTime=false` for a given field.
. Deploy the project.
. Open the process form.
. Specify the value in the process form.
. Check the process instance variables. The value for the given variable is empty.

Workaround: None.

.Form in KIE Server with a `java.util.Date` field does not allow to insert time part [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHPAM-4513[RHPAM-4513]]

Issue: When a process has a variable of type `java.util.Date`, the generated form, if the `showTime` attribute is `true`, does not allow inserting the time part. Then after submitting the `Date` variable shows all zeros in the time part of the datatype.

Workaround: None.

== Process Designer

.Bpmn2 files in XML editor have *Properties* panel that contains a data from other processes [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHPAM-4468[RHPAM-4468]]

Issue: If there are open two processes, one in the XML editor (legacy process with bpmn2 extension) and the one Stunner-based process, the properties in the *Properties* panel, as well as the diagram in the *Explore Diagram* from the Stunner process are shown in XML editor of the other process. The XML editor should not have any *Properties* or Diagram panel.

Steps to reproduce:

. Open any stunner process.
. Do not close the process.
. Open the legacy `legacy.bpmn2` process in the XML editor and open the *Properties* panel.

Actual result: The *Properties* and *Explore diagram* from a stunner process are shown in the XML editor's panel.

Expected result: No *Properties* and *Explore diagram* panels are present in the XML editor.

Workaround: None.

.Custom data object in the multiple variables causes an error in a case project [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHPAM-4422[RHPAM-4422]]

Issue: The custom data object in the multiple variables causes an error in a case project. You receive an UI exception with the following error:

[source]
====
Uncaught exception: Exception caught: Duplicate value: CustomDataObject [com.myspace.caseproject] Caused by: Duplicate value: CustomDataObject [com.myspace.caseproject]
====

Steps to reproduce:

. Create a case definition in a case project.
. Create a custom data object in the same project.
. Add a `procVar` process variable and `caseVar` case file variable with the same `CustomDataObject` type.
. Save the changes.
. Create a multiple instance node or a *Data Object* on the canvas.
. In the multiple instance node, set *MI Collection input/output* and try to change the *Data Input/Output* type. In the *Data Object* on canvas, try to change the data type.

Actual result:

* On Chrome browser: It is not possible to set the type with the first click. The custom type is chosen.
* On Firefox browser: An unexpected error occurs.

Expected result: It is possible to set the type properly. No errors occur.

Workaround: None.
