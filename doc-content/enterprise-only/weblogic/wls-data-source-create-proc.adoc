= Configuring JDBC data sources in {WEBLOGIC}

A data source is an object that enables a Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) client, such as an application server, to establish a connection with a database. Applications look up the data source on the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) tree or in the local application context and request a database connection to retrieve data. You must configure data sources for {WEBLOGIC} to ensure proper data exchange between the servers and the designated database.

.Prerequisite
The JDBC drivers that you want to use to create database connections are installed on all servers on which you want to deploy the data source. Some JDBC drivers are installed with {WEBLOGIC}, such as WebLogic-branded Data Direct JDBC drivers for DB2, Informix, MS SQL Server, and Sybase. For more information about JDBC drivers, see https://docs.oracle.com/middleware/12213/wls/JDBCA/third_party_drivers.htm#JDBCA231[Using JDBC Drivers with WebLogic Server] in the Oracle Help Center.

.Procedure
. In the WebLogic Administration Console, navigate to *Change Center* -> *Lock & Edit*.
. Under *Domain Structure*, click *Services* -> *Data Sources*.
. On the *Summary of Data Sources* page, click *New* -> *Generic Data Source*.
. On the *JDBC Data Sources Properties* page, enter or select the following information:
* *Name:* Enter a name for this JDBC data source. This name is used in the configuration file (`config.xml`) and throughout the Administration Console whenever referring to this data source.
* *JNDI Name:* Enter the JNDI path to where this JDBC data source will be bound. Applications look up the data source on the JNDI tree by this name when reserving a connection.
* *Database Type:* Select the DBMS of the database that you want to connect to. If your DBMS is not listed, select *Other*.
. Click *Next* to continue.
. Select the *Database Driver* that you want to use to connect to the database. The list includes common JDBC drivers for the selected DBMS and any other JDBC drivers that have been installed previously.
. On the *Transaction Options* page, leave the *Supports Global Transactions* option selected and choose from the available transaction options. You can also clear this check box to disable (ignore) global transactions in this data source. In most cases, you should leave the option selected for optimal data efficiency.
* *Two-Phase Commit:* Select this option to enable standard XA processing. This option is only available when you select an XA JDBC driver to make database connections.
* *Logging Last Resource:* Select this option to enable a non-XA JDBC connection to participate in global transactions using the Logging Last Resource (LLR) transaction optimization. This option is recommended in place of Emulate Two-Phase Commit. This option is only available when you select a non-XA JDBC driver to make database connections.
* *Emulate Two-Phase Commit:* Select this option to enable a non-XA JDBC connection to emulate participation in distributed transactions using JTA. Select this option only if your application can tolerate heuristic conditions. This option is only available when you select a non-XA JDBC driver to make database connections.
* *One-Phase Commit:* Select this option to enable the non-XA connection to participate in a global transaction as the only transaction participant. This option is only available when you select a non-XA JDBC driver to make database connections.
. Click *Next* to continue.
. On the *Connection Properties* page, enter values for the following properties:
* *Service Name:* Specify the service name of the database to which you want to connect. This must be the same for each data source if more than one is provided. This field is available only if you selected one of the available service-instance connections drivers for Oracle Real Application Clusters (RAC).
* *Database Name:* Enter the name of the database that you want to connect to. Exact database name requirements vary by JDBC driver and by DBMS.
* *Host Name:* Enter the DNS name or IP address of the server that hosts the database. If you are creating an Oracle GridLink service-instance connection, this must be the same for each data source if more than one is provided.
* *Port:* Enter the port on which the database server listens for connection requests.
* *Database User Name:* Enter the database user account name that you want to use for each connection in the data source.
* *Password/Confirm Password:* Enter the password for the database user account.
* *oracle.jdbc.DRCPConnectionClass:* Optionally, enter the Database Resident Connection Pooling (DCRP) connection class if required by your environment.
. Click *Next* to continue.
. On the *Test Database Connection* page, review the connection parameters and click *Test Configuration*.
+
{WEBLOGIC} attempts to create a connection from the Administration Server to the database. Results from the connection test are displayed at the top of the page. If the test is unsuccessful, correct any configuration errors and retry the test.
+
. Click *Next* to continue or to skip this step if the JDBC driver you selected is not installed on the Administration Server.
. On the *Select Targets* page, select the servers or clusters on which you want to deploy the data source and click *Finish*.
. Return to the main menu of the WebLogic Administration Console and select *Change Center* -> *Activate Changes*.
