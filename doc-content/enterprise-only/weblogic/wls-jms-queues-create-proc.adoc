= Create JMS queues

JMS queues are the destination end points for point-to-point messaging. You must create certain JMS queues to enable JMS messaging with {KIE_SERVER}.

.Prerequisites
* You have created a JMS server.
* You have created a JMS module.

.Procedure
. In the WebLogic Administration Console, navigate to *Services* -> *Messaging* -> *JMS Modules* to see the list of JMS modules.
. Select your previously created module, then click *New* to create a new JMS resource.
. Select *Queue* and click *Next*.
. For each of the following required queues, enter the name of the queue (for example, `KIE.SERVER.REQUEST`) and the JNDI name (for example, `jms/KIE.SERVER.REQUEST`)
and then click *Next*.
. Choose the JMS module subdeployment that connects to the JMS server.
. Click *Finish* to add the queue, and repeat for each required queue.
