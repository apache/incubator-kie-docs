= Importing business assets projects into and deploying from {CENTRAL}

You can import a business assets project that is part of a {PRODUCT} business application into {CENTRAL} and then deploy that project to a business application.

.Prerequistes
* You have a business application project running in development mode.
* {PRODUCT} {CENTRAL} is installed.

.Procedure
. Navigate to the `<business-application>/<business-application>-kjar` folder.
. Execute the following following commands to initialize the Git repository for your project:
+
[source]
----
$ git init
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Initial project structure"
----

. Log in to {CENTRAL} and go to *Menu* -> *Design* -> *Projects*.
. Select *Import Project* and enter following URL:
+
[source]
----
 file:///<business-application-path>/<business-application-name>-kjar
----

. Click *Import* and confirm the project to be imported.
. After the business assets project is imported into {CENTRAL}, open the project and click *Add Assets* to add assets such as
ifdef::PAM[]
business processes to your business assets project.
endif::PAM[]
ifdef::DM[]
rules and decision tables to your business assets project.
endif::DM[]
. Click *Deploy* on your project page to deploy your project to a running business application.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can also select the *Build & Install* option to build the project and publish the KJAR file to the configured Maven repository without deploying to a {KIE_SERVER}. This option is equivalent to running `mvn clean install` for your project in the command terminal. In a development environment, you can click *Deploy* to deploy the built KJAR file to a {KIE_SERVER} without aborting any running instances (if applicable), or click *Redeploy* to deploy the built KJAR file and abort any running instances. In a production environment, the *Redeploy* option is disabled and you can click *Deploy* only to deploy the built KJAR file to a new deployment unit (KIE container) on a {KIE_SERVER}.

To enable development mode in {CENTRAL}, go to project *Settings* -> *General Settings* -> *Version* and toggle the *Development Mode* option. Do not use *Development Mode* or manually add the `SNAPSHOT` version suffix for a production environment.
====

. To verify the deployment, go to *Menu* -> *Deploy* -> *Execution Servers*.
ifdef::PAM,JBPM[]
. To interact with your newly deployed business assets, go to *Menu* -> *Manage* -> *Process Definitions* and *Process Instances*.
