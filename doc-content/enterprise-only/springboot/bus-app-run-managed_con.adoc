= Running business application in development mode

Development (managed) mode enables developers to work on a {PRODUCT} business application business assets project and dynamically deploy changes to the business application without the need to restart it. In addition, development mode provides a complete monitoring environment for business automation capabilities, for example process instances, tasks, and jobs.

* You configured the business application.
* {PRODUCT} {CENTRAL} is installed and running.

.Procedure

The `clean install` part of the command tell Maven to build a fresh installation. The projects are then built in the following order:
+
* Data model
* Business assets
* Service
+
The first time that you run the script, it might take a while to build the project because all dependencies of the project are downloaded. At the end of the build, the application starts.
. Enter the following command to access your business application:
+
[source]
----
http://localhost:8090/
----
. Enter the credentials `user`/`user`  or `kie-server`/`kieserver!`.
Comment: what's the diff between the two if they both have the kieserver role?
. After the business application starts, it connects to the {CONTROLLER} and
is visible in the *Servers* perspective of {CENTRAL}.
