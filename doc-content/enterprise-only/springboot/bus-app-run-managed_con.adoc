The `clean install` argument directs Maven to build a fresh installation. The projects are then built in the following order:
+
* Data model
* Business assets
* Service
+
The first time that you run the script, it might take a while to build the project because all dependencies of the project are downloaded. At the end of the build, the application starts.
. Enter the following command to access your business application:
+
[source]
----
http://localhost:8090/
----
. Enter the credentials `user`/`user`  or `kieserver`/`kieserver1!`. After the business application starts, it connects to the {CONTROLLER} and is visible in *Menu* -> *Deploy* -> *Execution Servers* in {CENTRAL}.
