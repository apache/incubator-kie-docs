= Configuring business applications for JPA

The Java Persistence API (JPA) is a standard technology that enables you to map objects to relational databases. You must configure JPA for your {PRODUCT} business application.

.Prerequisites
* You have a Spring Boot business application service file that you created using the Maven archetype command. For more information, see xref:bus-app-create_{context}[].

.Procedure
. Navigate to the `<BUSINESS-APPLICATION>/<BUSINESS-APPLICATION>-service/src/main/resources` folder, where `<BUSINESS-APPLICATION>` is the name of your Spring Boot project.
. Open the `application.properties` file in a text editor.
. Locate the following parameters in the `application.properties` file and verify that they have the values shown:
+
[source, bash]
----
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.H2Dialect
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.show_sql=false
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto=update
spring.jpa.hibernate.naming.physical-strategy=org.hibernate.boot.model.naming.PhysicalNamingStrategyStandardImpl
----
. If your business application has business automation capabilities, you can add entities to the entity manager factory by adding a comma-separated list of packages:
+
[source, bash]
----
spring.jpa.properties.entity-scan-packages=org.jbpm.springboot.samples.entities
----
+
Business applications with business automation capabilities create an entity manager factory based on the `persistence.xml` file that comes with {PRODUCT}. All entities found in the `org.jbpm.springboot.samples.entities` package are automatically added to the entity manager factory and used the same as any other JPA entity in the application.
