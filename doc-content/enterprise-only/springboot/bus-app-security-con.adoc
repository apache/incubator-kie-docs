= Spring Security with {PRODUCT}
Spring Security is provided by a collection of servlet filters that make up the https://spring.io/projects/spring-security[Spring Security library]. These filters provide authentication through user names and passwords and authorization through roles. The default Spring Security implementation generated in a {PRODUCT} Spring Boot application provides authorization without authentication. This means that anyone with a user name and password valid for the application can access the application without a role.

The servlet filters protect your Spring Boot application against common exploits such as cross-site request forgery (CSRF) and cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). Spring Web relies on the https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/web.html#mvc-servlet[`DispatcherServlet`] to redirect incoming HTTP requests to your underlying java REST resources annotated with the `@Controller` annotation. The `DispatchServlet` is agnostic of elements such as security. It is good practice and more efficient to handle implementation details such a security outside of the business application logic. Therefore, Spring uses filters to intercept HTTP requests before routing them to the `DispatchServlet`.

A typical Spring Security implementation consists of the following steps that use multiple servlet filters:

. Extract and decode or decrypt user credentials from the HTTP request.
. Complete authentication by validating the credentials against the corporate identity provider, for example a database, a web service, or Red Hat Single Sign-On.
. Complete authorization by determining whether the authorized user has access rights to perform the request.
. If the user is authenticated and authorized, propagate the request to the `DispatchServlet`.

Spring breaks these steps down into individual filters and chains them together in a FilterChain. This chaining method provides the flexibility required to work with almost any identity provider and security framework. With Spring Security, you can define a FilterChain for your application programmatically. The following section is from the `business-application-service/src/main/java/com/company/service/DefaultWebSecurityConfig.java` file generated as part of a business application created on the `https://start.jbpm.org` web site.

@Configuration("kieServerSecurity")
@EnableWebSecurity
public class DefaultWebSecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override (1)
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
                .cors().and()
                .csrf().disable()       (2)
                .authorizeRequests()    (3)
                .antMatchers("/rest/*").authenticated().and()
                .httpBasic().and()      (4)
                .headers().frameOptions().disable();    (5)
    }

* *(1)* Overrides the default `configure(HttpSecurity  http)` method and defines a custom FilterChain using the Spring HttpClient fluent API/DSL
* *(2)* Disables common exploit filters for CORS and CSRF tokens for local testing
* *(3)* Requires authentication for any requests made to the pattern 'rest/*' but no roles are defined
* *(4)* Allows basic authentication through the authorization header, for example header 'Authorization: Basic dGVzdF91c2VyOnBhc3N3b3Jk'
* *(5)* Removes the 'X-Frame-Options' header from request/response

This configuration allows any authenticated user to execute the KIE API.

Because the default implementation is not integrated into any external identity provider, users are defined in memory, in the same `DefaultWebSecurityConfg` class. The following section shows the users that are provided when you create a {PRODUCT} Spring Boot business application:

    @Autowired
    public void configureGlobal(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) throws Exception {
        auth.inMemoryAuthentication().withUser("user").password("user").roles("kie-server");
        auth.inMemoryAuthentication().withUser("wbadmin").password("wbadmin").roles("admin");
        auth.inMemoryAuthentication().withUser("kieserver").password("kieserver1!").roles("kie-server");
    }
