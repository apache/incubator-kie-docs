= Configuring REST endpoints for Spring Boot applications

After you create your Spring Boot project, you can configure  the host, port, and path for the REST endpoint for your Spring Boot application.

.Prerequisites
* You have a ZIP file that you created using the http://start.jbpm.org[business application]  website.

.Procedure
. Unzip the `<business-application>.zip` file and navigate to the `<business-application>/<business-application>-service/src/main/resources` folder.
. Open the `application.properties` file in a text editor.
. Configure the host, port, and path for the REST endpoints, where `<ADDRESS>` is the server address and `<PORT>` is the server port:
+
[source, bash]
----
server.address=<ADDRESS>
server.port=<PORT>
cxf.path=/rest
----
+
The following example adds the REST endpoint to the address `localhost` on port `8090`.
+
[source, bash]
----
server.address=localhost
server.port=8090
cxf.path=/rest
----
