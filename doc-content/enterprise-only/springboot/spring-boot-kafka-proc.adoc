= Integrating Apache Kafka with your {PRODUCT} Spring Boot project

Apache Kafka is a distributed data streaming platform that can publish, subscribe to, store, and process streams of records in real time. It is designed to handle data streams from multiple sources and deliver them to multiple consumers. Apache Kafka is an alternative to a traditional enterprise messaging system.

You can integrate Apache Kafka with your {PRODUCT} Spring Boot project.
