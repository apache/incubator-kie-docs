= Downloading and configuring the {PRODUCT} Maven repository

If you do not want to use the online Maven repository, you can download and configure the {PRODUCT} Maven repository. The {PRODUCT} Maven repository contains many of the requirements that Java developers typically use to build their applications. This procedure describes how to edit the Maven `settings.xml` file to configure the {PRODUCT} Maven repository.

NOTE: When you configure the repository by modifying the Maven `settings.xml` file, the changes apply to all of your Maven projects.

.Prerequisites
* You have created a {PRODUCT} Spring Boot project.

.Procedure
. Navigate to the https://access.redhat.com/jbossnetwork/restricted/listSoftware.html[Software Downloads] page in the Red Hat Customer Portal (login required), and select the following product and version from the drop-down options:

* Product: {PRODUCT}
* Version: {PRODUCT_VERSION}
. Download *{PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} Maven Repository* (`{PRODUCT_FILE}-maven-repository.zip`).
. Extract the downloaded archive.
. Change to the `~/.m2/` directory and open the Maven `settings.xml` file in a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE).
. Add the following lines to the `<profiles>` element of the Maven `settings.xml` file, where `_<MAVEN_REPOSITORY>_` is the path of the Maven repository that you downloaded. The format of `_<MAVEN_REPOSITORY>_` must be `\file://$PATH`, for example `\file:///home/userX/{PRODUCT_FILE}.GA-maven-repository/maven-repository`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If your Maven repository contains outdated artifacts, you might encounter one of the following Maven error messages when you build or deploy your project, where `_<ARTIFACT_NAME>_` is the name of a missing artifact and `_<PROJECT_NAME>_` is the name of the project you are trying to build:

* `Missing artifact _<PROJECT_NAME>_`
* `[ERROR] Failed to execute goal on project _<ARTIFACT_NAME>_; Could not resolve dependencies for _<PROJECT_NAME>_`

To resolve the issue, delete the cached version of your local repository located in the  `~/.m2/repository` directory to force a download of the latest Maven artifacts.
