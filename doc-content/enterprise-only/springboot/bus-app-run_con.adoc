= Running business applications

By default, business applications contain a single runnable project, the service project. You can run the service project on Windows or Linux, in standalone or development (managed) mode. Standalone mode enables you to start your application without additional requirements. Applications started in development mode require Business Central to be available as the {CONTROLLER}.
