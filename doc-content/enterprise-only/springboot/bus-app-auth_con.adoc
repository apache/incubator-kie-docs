= Business application authentication and authorization

By default, business applications are secured by protecting all REST endpoints
(URLs that contain `/rest/`). In addition, business applications have two sets of log in credentials, both with the `kie-server` role, that allow users to connect to {CENTRAL} in development mode: the user with the ID `user` and password `user`  and the  `kie-server` user (password `kieserver!`)  )user- that allows to easy connect to
{CENTRAL} in development mode.

Both authentication and authorization is based on Spring security. This security configuration should be altered
for all business applications used in production environments.You can 
make configuration changes in the `<business-application>/<business-application>-servicesrc/main/java/com/company/service/DefaultWebSecurityConfig.java` file.
