= Creating a self-contained {PRODUCT} Spring Boot JAR file

You can create a single self-contained {PRODUCT} Spring Boot JAR file that contains a complete service, including {KIE_SERVER} and one or more KJAR files. The {PRODUCT} Spring Boot JAR file does not depend on any KJAR files loading at runtime.

If necessary, the {PRODUCT} Spring Boot JAR file can contain multiple versions of the same KJAR file, including modules. These KJAR files can have the same `artifactID` and `groupID` attribute values, but have different `version` values.

The included KJAR files are separated from any JAR files in the `BOOT-INF/lib` directory to avoid class loader collisions. Each KJAR classpath container file is isolated from other KJAR classpath container files and does not rely on the Spring Boot class loader.

.Prerequisites
* You have an existing {PRODUCT} Spring Boot project.
* You have completed development of one or more KJAR files for the project.

.Procedure
. Build all KJAR files for the project. In the default business application, the KJAR source is contained in the `<BUSINESS-APPLICATION>/<BUSINESS-APPLICATION>-kjar` directory, where `BUSINESS-APPLICATION` is the name of the business application. Your project might include other KJAR source directories.
+
To build the KJAR files, for every KJAR source directory, complete the following steps:
+
.. Change to the KJAR source directory.
.. Enter the following command:
+
----
mvn install
----
+
This command builds the KJAR file and places it into the local Maven repository. By default, this repository is located in the `~/.m2/repo` directory.
. In the `<BUSINESS-APPLICATION>/<BUSINESS-APPLICATION>-service/src/main/resources` directory, add the following properties to your Spring Boot application `application.properties` file:
+
[source]
----
kieserver.classPathContainer=true
kieserver.autoScanDeployments=true
----
+

[cols="30%,15%,55%", options="header"]
|===
|Parameter
|Values
|Description

|`kieserver.classPathContainer`
|`true, false`
|When set to `true`, {KIE_SERVER} uses the class loader used by the container to load KJAR files and their dependencies.

|`kieserver.autoScanDeployments`
|`true, false`
|When set to `true`, {KIE_SERVER} scans and deploys all KJAR files available in the Spring Boot application, whether they are declared programmatically or through the Maven plug-in.

|===

+
When both of these properties are set to `true`, the Spring Boot {KIE_SERVER} automatically scans for deployable artifacts that are packaged within the Spring Boot application using the `package-dependencies-kjar` Maven goal of the `kie-maven-plugin` plug-in.
+
. In the `<BUSINESS-APPLICATION>/<BUSINESS-APPLICATION>-service` directory, add the following Maven plug-in in the Spring Boot `service/pom.xml` file where `<GROUP_ID>`, `<ARTIFACT_ID>`, and `<VERSION>` are the group, artifact, and version (GAV) of a KJAR artifact that your project uses. You can find these values in the `pom.xml` file that is located in the KJAR source directory.
+
NOTE: You can add more than one version of an artifact.

<dependency>
  <groupId>org.kie.server</groupId>
  <artifactId>kie-server-controller-websocket-client</artifactId>

+
WebSockets communication with a {CENTRAL} Monitoring instance is supported in all cases, including running the instance on {OPENSHIFT}.

. To build the self-contained Spring Boot image, enter the following command in the `<BUSINESS-APPLICATION>/<BUSINESS-APPLICATION>-service` directory:
+
[source]
----
mvn install

. Optional: to run the self-contained Spring Boot image, locate the JAR file in the `target` subdirectory and enter the following command:
+
[source]
----
java -jar <FILENAME>.jar
----
+
In this command, replace `<FILENAME>` with the name of the JAR file.

+
In this command, replace the following values:
+
** `<FILENAME>` with the name of the JAR file
** `<BC-HOSTNAME>` with the fully qualified name of the {CENTRAL} Monitoring instance
