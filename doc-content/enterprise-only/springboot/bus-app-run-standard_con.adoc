The `clean install` argument directs Maven to build a fresh installation. The projects are then built in the following order:
+
* Data model
* Business assets
* Service
+
The first time that you run the script, it might take a while to build the project because all dependencies of the project are downloaded. At the end of the build, the application starts.
. Enter the following command to access your business application:

[source]
