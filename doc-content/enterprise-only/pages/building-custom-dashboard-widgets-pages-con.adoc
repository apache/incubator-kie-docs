= Page authoring

Pages, also known as perspectives, are collections of following components:

* Core components
* Navigational components
* Reporting components

Also, a page can have none or any number of components. The *Page Editor* tool is used to edit the pages.

A page has either the *Fluid* style or the *Page* style. The *Fluid* style is a classical web page with a vertical scroll bar, when the page exceeds the available height. The *Page* style is a web page that will always fit to the windows height.
