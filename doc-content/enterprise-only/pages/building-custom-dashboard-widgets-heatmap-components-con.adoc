= Heatmap components

In {CENTRAL}, you can add heatmap components to a page. Heatmap components are used to display heat information over a process diagram. The color on the process diagram nodes is related to the value you assign to each node and based on the assigned value, the color varies on a process diagram. If the assigned value is maximum, the heat intensifies and if a minimum value is assigned, then heat is not displayed on the process diagram.

You can export the heatmap components to Dashbuilder Runtime and retrieve the heat information from a {KIE_SERVER} dataset. You can also create, edit, and build a dashboard using a heatmap component.
