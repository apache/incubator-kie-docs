* Data set authoring: Define a data set for accessing the data and displaying it through the pages. For more information, see xref:adding-data-sets-proc_creating-custom-pages[Adding data sets].
ifdef::PAM[]
* Page authoring: Create the dashboard pages. For more information, see xref:building-custom-dashboard-widgets-creating-pages-proc[Creating pages].
* Publication - In this stage, navigation between pages are defined when you create the custom navigation trees or modify the existing default one (*Workbench* tree). For more information, see xref:building-custom-dashboard-widgets-creating-navigation-tree-proc[Creating a navigation tree] or xref:building-custom-dashboard-widgets-editing-navigation-tree-con[Editing a navigation tree].
endif::PAM[]
* Security management - In this stage, role and group permissions are set which defines the privileges that are granted to a user when the user is working on {CENTRAL}. For more information, see xref:con-business-central-security-management_creating-custom-pages[Security management].
