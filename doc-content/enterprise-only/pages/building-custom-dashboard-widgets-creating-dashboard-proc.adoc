= Creating a custom dashboard widget

In order to create custom dashboards, users must combine some of the features of the {CENTRAL} (like data sets, pages, navigation trees, and permissions) together and publish them. Dashboards are pages containing at least one reporting component.

There are four stages in the creation of a custom dashboard:

* Data set authoring - In this stage, you define a data set for accessing the data and displaying it through the pages. For more information, see xref:data_sets_add_proc[Adding data sets].
* Page authoring - In this stage, you create the pages which are used to display the data from the data sets, among other things. For more information, see xref:_building_custom_dashboard_widgets_creating_pages_proc[Creating pages].
* Publication - In this stage, navigation between pages are defined when you create the custom navigation trees or modify the existing default one (*Workbench* tree). For more information, see xref:building-custom-dashboard-widgets-creating-navigation-tree-proc[Creating a navigation tree] or xref:building-custom-dashboard-widgets-editing-navigation-tree-con[Editing a navigation tree].
* Security management - In this stage, role and group permissions are set which defines the privileges a user enjoys when working on {CENTRAL}. For more information, see xref:business-central-settings-security-proc[Security settings].

[NOTE]
====
You will have to follow the stages listed above if you plan on migrating your dashboards from previous versions of {CENTRAL} to the latest one. Note that there is no automatic migration path or tooling to assist you in that regard. You must recreate all your dashboards from scratch.
