= Creating heatmap components for a process

You can create heatmap components for a specific process in {CENTRAL}.

.Prerequisites

* {KIE_SERVER} is deployed and connected to {CENTRAL}.
* You have created a project with at least one business process asset in {CENTRAL}.
* A project with a process definition has been deployed in {CENTRAL}.
* Sample process instances are created.

.Procedure

. Create a new {KIE_SERVER} dataset using the following steps:
... In {CENTRAL}, go to *Admin* → *Data Sets*.
+
The *Data Set Explorer* page opens.
... Click *New Data Set* and select the *Execution Server* provider type.
+
The *Data Set Creation Wizard* page opens.
... Enter the name of the dataset.

... Select *CUSTOM* query target from the list.
... In the *Query* field, enter the following custom SQL query.
+
[source, SQL]

select
   pil.externalId,
   pil.processId,
   nil.nodeid,
   nil.nodetype,
   nil.nodename,
   count(nil.nodeid) as total_hits
from
    NodeInstanceLog nil
inner join
    ProcessInstanceLog pil on pil.processInstanceId = nil.processInstanceId
where
    nil.type = 1
group by
     pil.externalId,
     nil.nodeid,
     nil.nodename
----

[NOTE]
====
You can modify the SQL query according to your database if required.
====

... Complete the *Data Set Creation Wizard* and click *Test*.
... Click *Save*.
. In {CENTRAL}, go to *Menu* → *Design* → *Pages*.
. In the *Pages* panel, click *New*.
. In the *New Page* dialog box, enter a value in the *Name* field and select the required style.

The new page opens in the *Page Editor* and you can see that the *Heatmaps* component is available under the *Components* panel.
. In the *Components* panel, expand the *Heatmaps* components and drag the *Process Heatmap* component type to the *Page Editor*.
. In the *Displayer editor* wizard, click *Data* tab and select the newly created {KIE_SERVER} dataset.
. In the *Data* tab, select *NODEID* and *TOTAL_HITS* from the *Columns* field.
. Click the *Component Editor* tab and enter the values for the mandatory fields including *Server Template*, *Container ID*, and *Process Definition ID* into the *Component Properties* field.
