= Creating heatmap components for multiple processes

You can create heatmap components for multiple processes in {CENTRAL}.

.Prerequisites

* {KIE_SERVER} is deployed and connected to {CENTRAL}.
* You have set the `dashbuilder.components.enable` system property to `true` in the `standalone.xml` file.
* You have created multiple projects in {CENTRAL} and it contains at least one business process asset.
* A project with a process definition has been deployed in {CENTRAL}.
* Sample process instances are created.

.Procedure

. Create a new {KIE_SERVER} dataset using the following steps:
... In {CENTRAL}, go to *Admin* → *Data Sets*.
+
The *Data Set Explorer* page opens.
... Click *New Data Set* and select the *Execution Server* provider type.
+
The *Data Set Creation Wizard* page opens.
... Enter the name of the dataset.
... Select the server configuration. The server configuration is available if the project is deployed.
... Select *CUSTOM* query target from the list.
... In the *Query* field, enter the following custom SQL query.

select
   pil.externalId,
   pil.processId,
    nid,
    nodetype,
    nodename,
    count(nid) as total_hits,
    avg(execution_time) as averageExecutionTime,
    min(execution_time) as minExecutionTime,
    max(execution_time) as maxExecutionTime
from(
        select
                max(log_date) as lastLog,
                processinstanceid as piid,
                nodeinstanceid as niid,
                nodeid as nid,
                nodetype,
                nodename,
                DATEDIFF(SECOND, min(log_date), max(log_date)) as execution_time
        from
                NodeInstanceLog
        group by
              processinstanceid,
               nodeinstanceid,
              nid
       order by lastLog
)
inner join
     ProcessInstanceLog pil on pil.processInstanceId = piid
group by
     pil.externalId,
     nid,
     nodename

... Complete the *Data Set Creation Wizard* and click *Test*.
... Click *Save*.
. In {CENTRAL}, go to *Menu* → *Design* → *Pages*.
. In the *Pages* panel, click *New*.
. In the *New Page* dialog box, enter a value in the *Name* field and select the required style.
. Click *OK*.
+
The new page opens in the *Page Editor* and you can see that the *Heatmaps* component is available under the *Components* panel.
. In the *Components* panel, expand the *Heatmaps* components and drag the *All Processes Heatmaps* component type to the canvas.
. In the *Displayer editor* wizard, click *Data* tab and select the newly created {KIE_SERVER} dataset.
. In the *Data* tab, select *EXTERNALID*, *PROCESSID*, *NID*, and *AVERAGEEXECUTIONTIME* from the *Columns* field.
. In the *Process Selector* box, select the *Container* and *Process* values as per your requirement.
. Click the *Component Editor* tab and enter the value in the *Server Template* (mandatory) field.
+
[NOTE]
====
To access the value of *Server Template*, go to *Deploy* → *Execution Servers* → *Server Configurations*.
====
. Click the *Display* tab and edit the value of *Chart*, *Margins*, *Filter*, *Refresh*, and *Columns* as per your requirements.
. Click *+OK*.
