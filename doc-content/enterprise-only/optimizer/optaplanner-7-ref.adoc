= Changes that are not compatible with OptaPlanner 7.x or earlier

The changes listed in the section are not compatible with OptaPlanner 7.x or earlier versions of OptaPlanner.

[discrete]
== Java 11 or higher required
*Major*, *Public API*

If you are using JRE or JDK 8, upgrade to JDK 11 or higher.

* On Linux, get OpenJDK from your Linux software repository.
On Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux, enter the following command:
+
[source, bash]
----
sudo dnf install java-11-openjdk-devel
----

* On Windows and macOS, download OpenJDK from the https://adoptopenjdk.net[AdoptOpenJDK] website.

[discrete]
== `SolverFactory` and `PlannerBenchmarkFactory` no longer support KIE containers
*Major*, *Public API*

Because OptaPlanner now aligns with Kogito, the KIE container concept no longer applies.
Therefore, `SolverFactory` no longer allows you to create `Solver` instances from KIE containers. This also applies to `PlannerBenchmarkFactory` and benchmarks.

[discrete]
== OSGi metadata removed
*Major*, *Public API*

Because of the limited usage of OSGi and the maintenance burden it brings, the OptaPlanner JAR files in the OptaPlanner 8.x series no longer include OSGi metadata in their `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` file.

[discrete]
== Refrain from using Java serialization
*Minor*, *Public API*

In OptaPlanner 8, most uses of the `Serializable` marker interface were removed from the public API. Consider serializing with JSON or another format.

[discrete]
== `SolverFactory.getScoreDirectorFactory()` replaced with `ScoreManager`
*Major*, *Public API*

In version 7 of OptaPlanner, using `ScoreDirectorFactory` was necessary in order to explain the score.
In version 8 of OptPlanner, new functionality was added to the `ScoreManager` and as a result there is no longer any reason to create new instances of `ScoreDirector`.

An example from a `*.java` file in OptaPlanner 7:

[source,java]
----
ScoreDirectorFactory<CloudBalance> scoreDirectorFactory = solverFactory.getScoreDirectorFactory();
try (ScoreDirector<CloudBalance> scoreDirector = scoreDirectorFactory.buildScoreDirector()) {
    scoreDirector.setWorkingSolution(solution);
    Score score = scoreDirector.calculateScore();
}
----

An example from a `*.java` file in OptaPlanner 8:

[source,java]
----
ScoreManager<CloudBalance> scoreManager = ScoreManager.create(solverFactory);
Score score = scoreManager.updateScore(solution);
----

Methods that allowed you to retrieve an instance of `ScoreDirector` and `ScoreDirectorFactory` have been removed from the public API without replacement.
A reduced version of the `ScoreDirector` interface was promoted to the public API to promote the
`ProblemFactChange` interface to the public API.

[discrete]
== `SolverFactory`: `getSolverConfig()` removed
*Minor*, *Public API*

The `SolverFactory.getSolverConfig()` method has been deprecated and replaced with the `SolverFactory.create(SolverConfig)` method.
A `SolverConfig` instance is now instantiated before a `SolverFactory` instance is instantiated, which is more natural.
The previous order has been removed.

An example from a `*.java` file in OptaPlanner 7:

[source,java]
----
SolverFactory<MySolution> solverFactory = SolverFactory.createFromXmlResource(".../mySolverConfig.xml");
SolverConfig solverConfig = solverFactory.getSolverConfig();
...
Solver<MySolution> solver = solverFactory.buildSolver();
----

An example from a `*.java` file in OptaPlanner 8:

[source,java]
----
SolverConfig solverConfig = SolverConfig.createFromXmlResource(".../mySolverConfig.xml");
...
SolverFactory<MySolution> solverFactory = SolverFactory.create(solverConfig);
Solver<MySolution> solver = solverFactory.buildSolver();
----

If you were also passing a `ClassLoader`, pass it to both `SolverConfig.createFromXmlResource()` and `SolverFactory.create()`.

[discrete]
== `SolverConfig`: `buildSolver()` removed
*Minor*, *Public API*

The `SolverConfig.buildSolver()` method is an inner method that does not belong in the public API.
Use the `SolverFactory.buildSolver()` method instead.

An example from a `*.java` file in OptaPlanner 7:

[source,java]
----
SolverConfig solverConfig = SolverConfig.createFromXmlResource(".../mySolverConfig.xml");
...
Solver<MySolution> solver = solverConfig.buildSolver();
----

An example from a `*.java` file in OptaPlanner 8:

[source,java]
----
SolverConfig solverConfig = SolverConfig.createFromXmlResource(".../mySolverConfig.xml");
...
SolverFactory<MySolution> solverFactory = SolverFactory.create(solverConfig);
Solver<MySolution> solver = solverFactory.buildSolver();
----

[discrete]
== `PlannerBenchmarkConfig`: `buildPlannerBenchmark()` removed
*Minor*, *Public API*

The `PlannerBenchmarkConfig.buildPlannerBenchmark()` method is an inner method that does not belong in the public API.
Use the `PlannerBenchmarkFactory.buildPlannerBenchmark()` method instead.

An example from a `*.java` file in OptaPlanner 7:

[source,java]
----
PlannerBenchmarkConfig benchmarkConfig = PlannerBenchmarkConfig.createFromXmlResource(
        ".../cloudBalancingBenchmarkConfig.xml");
...
PlannerBenchmark benchmark = benchmarkFactory.buildPlannerBenchmark();
----

An example from a `*.java` file in OptaPlanner 8:

[source,java]
----
PlannerBenchmarkConfig benchmarkConfig = PlannerBenchmarkConfig.createFromXmlResource(
        ".../cloudBalancingBenchmarkConfig.xml");
...
PlannerBenchmarkFactory benchmarkFactory = PlannerBenchmarkFactory.create(benchmarkConfig);
PlannerBenchmark benchmark = benchmarkFactory.buildPlannerBenchmark();
----

[discrete]
== `SolverFactory`: `cloneSolverFactory()` removed
*Minor*, *Public API*

The `SolverFactory.cloneSolverFactory()` method has been deprecated and replaced with the new `SolverConfig(SolverConfig)` copy constructors and the `SolverFactory.cloneSolverFactory()` method has been removed.

An example from a `*.java` file in OptaPlanner 7:

[source,java]
----
private SolverFactory<MySolution> base;

public void userRequest(..., long userInput) {
    SolverFactory<MySolution> solverFactory = base.cloneSolverFactory();
    solverFactory.getSolverConfig()
            .getTerminationConfig()
            .setMinutesSpentLimit(userInput);
    Solver<MySolution> solver = solverFactory.buildSolver();
    ...
}
----

An example from a `*.java` file in OptaPlanner 8:

[source,java]
----
private SolverConfig base;

public void userRequest(..., long userInput) {
    SolverConfig solverConfig = new SolverConfig(base); // Copy it
    solverConfig.getTerminationConfig()
            .setMinutesSpentLimit(userInput);
    SolverFactory<MySolution> solverFactory = SolverFactory.create(solverConfig);
    Solver<MySolution> solver = solverFactory.buildSolver();
    ...
}
----

[discrete]
== `SolverFactory`: `createEmpty()` removed
*Minor*, *Public API*

The `SolverFactory.createEmpty()` method has been deprecated and replaced with the `new SolverConfig()` method.
The `SolverFactory.createEmpty()` method has been removed.

An example from a `*.java` file in OptaPlanner 7:

[source,java]
----
SolverFactory<MySolution> solverFactory = SolverFactory.createEmpty();
SolverConfig solverConfig = solverFactory.getSolverConfig()
...
Solver<MySolution> solver = solverFactory.buildSolver();
----

An example from a `*.java` file in OptaPlanner 8:

[source,java]
----
SolverConfig solverConfig = new SolverConfig();
...
SolverFactory<MySolution> solverFactory = SolverFactory.create(solverConfig);
Solver<MySolution> solver = solverFactory.buildSolver();
----

[discrete]
== XML <solver/> root element now belongs to the https://www.optaplanner.org/xsd/solver namespace
*Major*, *Public API*

OptaPlanner now provides an XML schema definition for the solver configuration.
Although OptaPlanner retains compatibility with previous versions of the existing XML configuration,
migrating to the XSD is strongly recommended because OptaPlanner might support only valid configuration XML in the future.

An example from the `*SolverConfig.xml` file in OptaPlanner 7:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<solver>
  ...
</solver>
----

An example from the `*SolverConfig.xml` file in OptaPlanner 8:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<solver xmlns="https://www.optaplanner.org/xsd/solver" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="https://www.optaplanner.org/xsd/solver https://www.optaplanner.org/xsd/solver/solver.xsd">
  ...
</solver>
----

Using the XSD might require reordering some of the XML elements of the configuration.
Use code completion in the IDE to migrate to a valid XML.

[discrete]
== Property `subPillarEnabled` in move selector configuration has been removed
*Minor*, *Public API*

The `subPillarEnabled` property on `PillarSwapMoveSelector` and `PillarChangeMoveSelector` has been deprecated and replaced with a new property, `subPillarType`.
The `subPillarEnabled` property has been removed.

An example from the `*SolverConfig.xml` and `*BenchmarkConfig.xml` files in OptaPlanner 7:

[source,xml]
----
      <pillar...MoveSelector>
        ...
        <pillarSelector>
          <subPillarEnabled>false</subPillarEnabled>
          ...
        </pillarSelector>
        ...
      </pillar...MoveSelector>
----

An example from the `*SolverConfig.xml` and `*BenchmarkConfig.xml` files in OptaPlanner 8:

[source,xml]
----
      <pillar...MoveSelector>
        <subPillarType>NONE</subPillarType>
        <pillarSelector>
          ...
        </pillarSelector>
        ...
      </pillar...MoveSelector>
----

[discrete]
== `Solver`: `getScoreDirectorFactory()` removed
*Major*, *Public API*

The `getScoreDirectorFactory()` method has been deprecated and has now been removed from both `Solver` and
`SolverFactory` classes.

You no longer need to create a `Solver` instance just to calculate or explain a score in the UI.
Use the `ScoreManager` API instead.

An example from a `*.java` file in OptaPlanner 7:

[source,java]
----
SolverFactory<VehicleRoutingSolution> solverFactory = SolverFactory.createFromXmlResource(...);
Solver<VehicleRoutingSolution> solver = solverFactory.buildSolver();
uiScoreDirectorFactory = solver.getScoreDirectorFactory();
...
----

An example from a `*.java` file in OptaPlanner 8:

[source,java]
----
SolverFactory<VehicleRoutingSolution> solverFactory = SolverFactory.createFromXmlResource(...);
ScoreManager<VehicleRoutingSolution> scoreManager = ScoreManager.create(solverFactory);
...
----

`ScoreDirectorFactory` should not be used anymore because it has always been outside the public API and all of its functionality is exposed in various parts of the public API.

[discrete]
== `Solver.explainBestScore()` has been removed
*Major*, *Public API*

The `explainBestScore()` method on the `Solver` interface was deprecated in 7.x and has now removed.
You can obtain the same information through the new `ScoreManager` API.

Red Hat recommends that you do not parse the results of this method call in any way.

An example from a `*.java` file in OptaPlanner 7:

[source,java]
----
solver = ...;
scoreExplanation = solver.explainBestScore();
----

An example from a `*.java` file in OptaPlanner 8:

[source,java]
----
MySolution solution = ...;
ScoreManager<MySolution> scoreManager = ...;
scoreExplanation = scoreManager.explainScore(solution);
----

[discrete]
== The Solver interface methods `getBestSolution()`, `getBestScore()`, and `getTimeMillisSpent()` have been removed
*Minor*, *Public API*

Several methods on the `Solver` interface have been deprecated in 7.x and have been removed.
You can obtain the same information by registering an `EventListener` through the `Solver.addEventListener(...)`.

An example from a `*.java` file in OptaPlanner 7:

[source,java]
----
solver = ...;
solution = solver.getBestSolution();
score = solver.getBestScore();
timeMillisSpent = solver.getTimeMillisSpent();
----

An example from a `*.java` file in OptaPlanner 8:

[source,java]
----
solver = ...;
solver.addEventListener(event -> {
    solution = event.getNewBestSolution();
    score = event.getNewBestScore();
    timeMillisSpent = event.getTimeMillisSpent();
});
----

[discrete]
== Annotation scanning has been removed
*Major*, *Public API*

The `<scanAnnotatedClasses/>` directive in the solver configuration was deprecated in 7.x and is now removed.

An example from the `*.xml` file in OptaPlanner 7:

[source,xml]
----
<solver>
    ...
    <scanAnnotatedClasses/>
    ...
</solver>
----

An example from the `*.xml` file in OptaPlanner 8:

[source,xml]
----
<solver>
    ...
    <solutionClass>...</solutionClass>
    <entityClass>...</entityClass>
    ...
</solver>
----

[discrete]
== New package for `@PlanningFactProperty` and `@PlanningFactCollectionProperty`
*Major*, *Public API*

The `@PlanningFactProperty` and `@PlanningFactCollectionProperty` now share the same package with other similar annotations, such as `@PlanningSolution`.
The old annotations have been deprecated in 7.x and removed.

An example from a `*.java` file in OptaPlanner 7:

[source,java]
----
import org.optaplanner.core.api.domain.solution.drools.ProblemFactCollectionProperty;
import org.optaplanner.core.api.domain.solution.drools.ProblemFactProperty;
----

An example from a `*.java` file in OptaPlanner 8:

[source,java]
----
import org.optaplanner.core.api.domain.solution.ProblemFactCollectionProperty;
import org.optaplanner.core.api.domain.solution.ProblemFactProperty;
----

[discrete]
== `filterClassList` replaced with a single filterClass
*Minor*, *Public API*

The configuration of `EntitySelector`, `ValueSelector`, and `MoveSelector` now has a single filter class in both the configuration API and the solver configuration XML.

In practice, you do not need multiple selection filter classes often, and you can replace them with a single selection filter class that implements the logic of all of them.
Passing a single selection class now requires less boilerplate code.

An example from a `*.java` file in OptaPlanner 7:

[source,java]
----
ValueSelectorConfig valueSelectorConfig = new ValueSelectorConfig();
valueSelectorConfig.setFilterClassList(Collections.singletonList(MySelectionFilterClass.class));
----

An example from a `*.java` file in OptaPlanner 8:

[source,java]
----
ValueSelectorConfig valueSelectorConfig = new ValueSelectorConfig();
valueSelectorConfig.setFilterClass(MySelectionFilterClass.class);
----

.Replacing multiple selection filter classes with a single selection filter class

An example from the `*.xml` file in OptaPlanner 7:

[source,xml]
----
<swapMoveSelector>
  <entitySelector>
    <filterClass>com.example.FilterA</filterClass>
    <filterClass>com.example.FilterB</filterClass>
  </entitySelector>
</swapMoveSelector>
----

An example from a `*.java` file in OptaPlanner 7:

[source,java]
----
package com.example;
...
public class FilterA implements SelectionFilter<MySolution, MyPlanningEntity> {

    @Override
    public boolean accept(ScoreDirector<MySolution> scoreDirector, MyPlanningEntity selection) {
        return selection.getValue() < 500;
    }
}
----

[source,java]
----
package com.example;
...
public class FilterB implements SelectionFilter<MySolution, MyPlanningEntity> {

    @Override
    public boolean accept(ScoreDirector<MySolution> scoreDirector, MyPlanningEntity selection) {
        return selection.getOrder() == Order.ASC;
    }
}
----

An example from the `*.xml` file in OptaPlanner 8:

[source,xml]
----
<swapMoveSelector>
  <entitySelector>
    <filterClass>com.example.SingleEntityFilter</filterClass>
  </entitySelector>
</swapMoveSelector>
----

An example from a `*.java` file in OptaPlanner 8:

[source,java]
----
package com.example;
...
public class SingleEntityFilter implements SelectionFilter<MySolution, MyPlanningEntity> {

    @Override
    public boolean accept(ScoreDirector<MySolution> scoreDirector, MyPlanningEntity selection) {
        return selection.getValue() < 500 && selection.getOrder() == Order.ASC;
    }
}
----

[discrete]
== `AcceptorConfig` renamed to `LocalSearchAcceptorConfig`
*Minor*

This only impacts the configuration API. The solver configuration XML file remains intact.

Naming consistency with other local-search-specific configuration classes has been implemented.

An example from a `*.java` file in OptaPlanner 7:

[source,java]
----
LocalSearchPhaseConfig localSearchPhaseConfig = new LocalSearchPhaseConfig()
        .withAcceptorConfig(new AcceptorConfig().withEntityTabuSize(5));
----

An example from a `*.java` file in OptaPlanner 8:

[source,java]
----
LocalSearchPhaseConfig localSearchPhaseConfig = new LocalSearchPhaseConfig()
        .withAcceptorConfig(new LocalSearchAcceptorConfig().withEntityTabuSize(5));
----

[discrete]
== Custom properties XML configuration format changes
*Minor*, *Public API*

This issue only impacts the solver configuration XML, specifically `<scoreDirectorFactory/>`, `<moveIteratorFactory/>`,
`<moveListFactory/>`, `<partitionedSearch/>` and `<customPhase/>`.

This change was made to enforce the structure of the configuration XML in build time.

An example from the `*.xml` file in OptaPlanner 7:

[source,xml]
----
<partitionedSearch>
  <solutionPartitionerClass>com.example.MySolutionPartitioner</solutionPartitionerClass>
  <solutionPartitionerCustomProperties>
    <partCount>4</partCount> <!-- a custom property -->
    <minimumProcessListSize>300</minimumProcessListSize> <!-- a custom property -->
  </solutionPartitionerCustomProperties>
</partitionedSearch>
----

An example from the `*.xml` file in OptaPlanner 8:

[source,xml]
----
<partitionedSearch>
  <solutionPartitionerClass>com.example.MySolutionPartitioner</solutionPartitionerClass>
  <solutionPartitionerCustomProperties>
    <property name="partCount" value="4"/> <!-- a custom property -->
    <property name="minimumProcessListSize" value="300"/> <!-- a custom property -->
  </solutionPartitionerCustomProperties>
</partitionedSearch>
----

[discrete]
== `<variableNameInclude/>` elements are now wrapped by the `<variableNameIncludes/>` element
*Minor*, *Public API*

This update only impacts the solver configuration XML, specifically the `<swapMoveSelector/>` and `<pillarSwapMoveSelector/>`.

This change was made to enforce the structure of the configuration XML in build time.

An example from the `*.xml` file in OptaPlanner 7:

[source,xml]
----
<swapMoveSelector>
  <variableNameInclude>variableA</variableNameInclude>
  <variableNameInclude>variableB</variableNameInclude>
</swapMoveSelector>
----

An example from the `*.xml` file in OptaPlanner 8:

[source,xml]
----
<swapMoveSelector>
  <variableNameIncludes>
    <variableNameInclude>variableA</variableNameInclude>
    <variableNameInclude>variableB</variableNameInclude>
  </variableNameIncludes>
</swapMoveSelector>
----

[discrete]
== `Solution` interface removed
*Minor*, *Public API*

The `Solution` interface was deprecated and removed. The `AbstractSolution` interface which is only used by {CENTRAL} has also been removed.

Remove the `Solution` interface, annotate the `getScore()` method with `@PlanningScore`,
and replace the `getProblemFacts()` method with a `@ProblemFactCollectionProperty` annotation directly on every problem fact getter (or field).

An example from a `*.java` file in OptaPlanner 7:

[source,java]
----
@PlanningSolution
public class CloudBalance implements Solution<HardSoftScore> {

    private List<CloudComputer> computerList;
    ...

    private HardSoftScore score;

    @ValueRangeProvider(id = "computerRange")
    public List<CloudComputer> getComputerList() {...}

    public HardSoftScore getScore() {...}
    public void setScore(HardSoftScore score) {...}

    public Collection<? extends Object> getProblemFacts() {
        List<Object> facts = new ArrayList<Object>();
        facts.addAll(computerList);
        ...
        return facts;
    }

}
----

An example from a `*.java` file in OptaPlanner 8:

[source,java]
----
@PlanningSolution
public class CloudBalance {

    private List<CloudComputer> computerList;
    ...

    private HardSoftScore score;

    @ValueRangeProvider(id = "computerRange")
    @ProblemFactCollectionProperty
    public List<CloudComputer> getComputerList() {...}

    @PlanningScore
    public HardSoftScore getScore() {...}
    public void setScore(HardSoftScore score) {...}

}
----

For a single problem fact that is not wrapped in a `Collection`, use the `@ProblemFactProperty` annotation, as shown in the following example, with field annotations this time:

An example from a `*.java` file in OptaPlanner 7:

[source,java]
----
@PlanningSolution
public class CloudBalance implements Solution<HardSoftScore> {

    private CloudParametrization parametrization;
    private List<CloudBuilding> buildingList;
    @ValueRangeProvider(id = "computerRange")
    private List<CloudComputer> computerList;
    ...

    public Collection<? extends Object> getProblemFacts() {
        List<Object> facts = new ArrayList<Object>();
        facts.add(parametrization); // not a Collection
        facts.addAll(buildingList);
        facts.addAll(computerList);
        ...
        return facts;
    }

}
----

An example from a `*.java` file in OptaPlanner 8:

[source,java]
----
@PlanningSolution
public class CloudBalance {

    @ProblemFactProperty
    private CloudParametrization parametrization;
    @ProblemFactCollectionProperty
    private List<CloudBuilding> buildingList;
    @ValueRangeProvider(id = "computerRange")
    @ProblemFactCollectionProperty
    private List<CloudComputer> computerList;
    ...

}
----

Do not add the `@ProblemFactCollectionProperty` annotation on getters (or fields) that have a `@PlanningEntityCollectionProperty` annotation.

[discrete]
== `BestSolutionChangedEvent`: `isNewBestSolutionInitialized()` removed
*Minor*, *Public API*

The `BestSolutionChangedEvent.isNewBestSolutionInitialized()` method has been deprecated and replaced with the `BestSolutionChangedEvent.getNewBestSolution().getScore().isSolutionInitialized()` method. The `BestSolutionChangedEvent.isNewBestSolutionInitialized()` method has been removed.

An example from a `*.java` file in OptaPlanner 7:

[source,java]
----
    public void bestSolutionChanged(BestSolutionChangedEvent<CloudBalance> event) {
        if (event.isEveryProblemFactChangeProcessed()
                && event.isNewBestSolutionInitialized()) {
            ...
        }
    }
----

An example from a `*.java` file in OptaPlanner 8:

[source,java]
----
    public void bestSolutionChanged(BestSolutionChangedEvent<CloudBalance> event) {
        if (event.isEveryProblemFactChangeProcessed()
                && event.getNewBestSolution().getScore().isSolutionInitialized()) {
            ...
        }
    }
----

If you check `isFeasible()`, it checks if the solution is initialized.

An example from a `*.java` file in OptaPlanner 8:

[source,java]
----
    public void bestSolutionChanged(BestSolutionChangedEvent<CloudBalance> event) {
        if (event.isEveryProblemFactChangeProcessed()
                // isFeasible() checks isSolutionInitialized() too
                && event.getNewBestSolution().getScore().isFeasible()) {
            ...
        }
    }
----

[discrete]
== `<valueSelector>`: `variableName` is now an attribute
*Minor*, *Public API*

When power-tweaking move selectors, such as `<changeMoveSelector>`, in a use case with multiple planning variables, the `<variableName>` XML element has been replaced with a `variableName="..."` XML attribute.
This change reduces the solver configuration verbosity.
After being deprecated for the entire 7.x series, the old way has now been removed.

An example from the `*SolverConfig.xml` and `*BenchmarkConfig.xml` files in OptaPlanner 7:

[source,xml]
----
  <valueSelector>
    <variableName>room</variableName>
  </valueSelector>
----

An example from the `*SolverConfig.xml` and `*BenchmarkConfig.xml` files in OptaPlanner 8:

[source,xml]
----
  <valueSelector variableName="room"/>
----

[discrete]
== Partitioned Search: `threadFactoryClass` removed
*Minor*, *Public API*

Because `<solver>` has supported a `<threadFactoryClass>` element for some time, the `<threadFactoryClass>` element under `<partitionedSearch>` has been removed.

An example from the `*SolverConfig.xml` and `*BenchmarkConfig.xml` files in OptaPlanner 7:

[source,xml]
----
  <solver>
    ...
    <partitionedSearch>
      <threadFactoryClass>...MyAppServerThreadFactory</threadFactoryClass>
      ...
    </partitionedSearch>
  </solver>
----

An example from the `*SolverConfig.xml` and `*BenchmarkConfig.xml` files in OptaPlanner 8:

[source,xml]
----
  <solver>
    <threadFactoryClass>...MyAppServerThreadFactory</threadFactoryClass>
    ...
    <partitionedSearch>
      ...
    </partitionedSearch>
  </solver>
----

[discrete]
== `SimpleDoubleScore` and `HardSoftDoubleScore` removed
*Minor*, *Public API*

The use of double-based score types is not recommended because they can cause score corruption.
They have been removed.

An example from a `*.java` file in OptaPlanner 7:

[source,java]
----
@PlanningSolution
public class MyPlanningSolution {

    private SimpleDoubleScore score;

    ...

}
----

An example from a `*.java` file in OptaPlanner 8:

[source,java]
----
@PlanningSolution
public class MyPlanningSolution {

    private SimpleLongScore score;

    ...

}
----

[discrete]
== `Score.toInitializedScore()` removed
*Minor*, *Public API*

The `Score.toInitializedScore()` method was deprecated and replaced with the `Score.withInitScore(int)` method in 7.x and is now removed.

An example from a `*.java` file in OptaPlanner 7:

[source,java]
----
score = score.toInitializedScore();
----

An example from a `*.java` file in OptaPlanner 8:

[source,java]
----
score = score.withInitScore(0);
----

[discrete]
== Various justification `Comparators` removed
*Minor*, *Public API*

The following `Comparator` implementations were deprecated in 7.x and now removed:

- `org.optaplanner.core.api.score.comparator.NaturalScoreComparator`
- `org.optaplanner.core.api.score.constraint.ConstraintMatchScoreComparator`
- `org.optaplanner.core.api.score.constraint.ConstraintMatchTotalScoreComparator`
- `org.optaplanner.core.api.score.constraint.IndictmentScoreComparator`

An example from a `*.java` file in OptaPlanner 7:

[source,java]
----
NaturalScoreComparator comparator = new NaturalScoreComparator();
ConstraintMatchScoreComparator comparator2 = new ConstraintMatchScoreComparator();
----

An example from a `*.java` file in OptaPlanner 8:

[source,java]
----
Comparator<Score> comparator = Comparable::compareTo;
Comparator<ConstraintMatch> comparator2 = Comparator.comparing(ConstraintMatch::getScore);
----

[discrete]
== `FeasibilityScore` removed
*Minor*, *Public API*

The `FeasibilityScore` interface was deprecated in 7.x and its only method `isFeasible()` moved to the `Score`
supertype.
The interface has now been removed.

You should refer to ``Score``s by their ultimate type, for example `HardSoftScore` instead of to `Score`.

[discrete]
== `@PlanningEntity.movableEntitySelectionFilter` removed
*Minor*, *Public API*

The `movableEntitySelectionFilter` field on the `@PlanningEntity` annotation was deprecated in 7.x and a new field
`pinningFilter` has been introduced with a name that shows the relation to the `@PlanningPin` annotation.
This filter implements a new `PinningFilter` interface, returning true if the entity is pinned, and false if movable.
The logic of this new filter is therefore inverted as compared to the old filter.

You should update your `@PlanningEntity` annotations by supplying the new filter instead of the old filter.
The old filter has now been removed.

An example from a `*.java` file in OptaPlanner 7:

[source,java]
----
@PlanningEntity(movableEntitySelectionFilter = MyMovableEntitySelectionFilter.class)
----

An example from a `*.java` file in OptaPlanner 8:

[source,java]
----
@PlanningEntity(pinningFilter = MyPinningFilter.class)
----

[discrete]
== `@PlanningVariable.reinitializeVariableEntityFilter` removed
*Minor*, *Public API*

The `reinitializeVariableEntityFilter` field on `@PlanningVariable` annotation has been deprecated for removal in 7.x and now removed.


[discrete]
== `*ScoreHolder` classes turned into interfaces
*Minor*, *Public API*

In OptaPlanner 7, `ScoreHolder` classes, used exclusively for Drools score calculation, exposed a number of public methods which, if used, allowed the user to unintentionally corrupt or otherwise negatively affect their scores.

In OptaPlanner 8, these methods have been removed and the classes have been turned into interfaces.
Most users do not use the removed and potentially harmful methods.

However, if you do use these methods, you will find suitable replacements in the public API in areas of score explanation and
constraint configuration.

[discrete]
== `ValueRangeFactory` class now final
*Minor*

`ValueRangeFactory` class is a factory class that has only static methods.
There is no need for you to extend this class, and it has therefore been made `final`.

An example from a `*.java` file in OptaPlanner 7:

[source,java]
----
class MyValueRangeFactory extends ValueRangeFactory {
    ...
}
----

An example from a `*.java` file in OptaPlanner 8:

[source,java]
----
class MyValueRangeFactory {
    ...
}
----

[discrete]
== `ConstraintMatchTotal` and `Indictment` are now interfaces
*Minor*, *Public API*

`ConstraintMatchTotal` and `Indictment` classes have been converted into interfaces. As a result, their implementations were moved out of the public API, together with methods that allowed them to mutate their state.
These methods were never intended for the public API, and therefore there is no replacement for them.

You might still need the instances themselves if you choose to implement `ConstraintMatchAwareIncrementalScoreCalculator`:

[source,java]
----
ConstraintMatchTotal maximumCapacityMatchTotal = new ConstraintMatchTotal(...);
----

An example from a `*.java` file in OptaPlanner 8:

[source,java]
----
ConstraintMatchTotal maximumCapacityMatchTotal = new DefaultConstraintMatchTotal(...);
----

[discrete]
== `ScoreManager`: generic type `Score` added
*Major*, *Public API*

The `ScoreManager` and `ScoreExplanation` APIs now have the generic type `Score` to avoid downcasts in your code, for example from `Score` to `HardSoftScore`.

An example from a `*.java` file in OptaPlanner 7:

[source,java]
----
    @Inject // or @Autowired
    ScoreManager<TimeTable> scoreManager;
----

An example from a `*.java` file in OptaPlanner 8:

[source,java]
----
    @Inject // or @Autowired
    ScoreManager<TimeTable, HardSoftScore> scoreManager;
----

An example from a `*.java` file in OptaPlanner 7:

[source,java]
----
    ScoreExplanation<TimeTable> explanation = scoreManager.explainScore(timeTable);
    HardSoftScore score = (HardSoftScore) explanation.getScore();
----

An example from a `*.java` file in OptaPlanner 8:

[source,java]
----
    ScoreExplanation<TimeTable, HardSoftScore> explanation = scoreManager.explainScore(timeTable);
    HardSoftScore score = explanation.getScore();
----

[discrete]
== `ConstraintMatchTotal`, `ConstraintMatch`, and `Indictment`: generic type `Score` added
*Major*

Similar to `ScoreManager` and `ScoreExplanation`, the `ConstraintMatchTotal`, `ConstraintMatch`, and `Indictment` APIs
now have a generic type `Score` to avoid downcasts in your code, for example from `Score` to `HardSoftScore`.

An example from a `*.java` file in OptaPlanner 7:

[source,java]
----
    ScoreExplanation<TimeTable> explanation = scoreManager.explainScore(timeTable);
    Map<String, ConstraintMatchTotal> constraintMatchTotalMap = scoreExplanation.getConstraintMatchTotalMap();
    ConstraintMatchTotal constraintMatchTotal = constraintMatchTotalMap.get(contraintId);
    HardSoftScore totalScore = (HardSoftScore) constraintMatchTotal.getScore();
----

An example from a `*.java` file in OptaPlanner 8:

[source,java]
----
    ScoreExplanation<TimeTable, HardSoftScore> explanation = scoreManager.explainScore(timeTable);
    Map<String, ConstraintMatchTotal<HardSoftScore>> constraintMatchTotalMap = scoreExplanation.getConstraintMatchTotalMap();
    ConstraintMatchTotal<HardSoftScore> constraintMatchTotal = constraintMatchTotalMap.get(contraintId);
    HardSoftScore totalScore = constraintMatchTotal.getScore();
----

An example from a `*.java` file in OptaPlanner 7:

[source,java]
----
    ScoreExplanation<TimeTable> explanation = scoreManager.explainScore(timeTable);
    Map<Object, Indictment> indictmentMap = scoreExplanation.getIndictmentMap();
    Indictment indictment = indictmentMap.get(lesson);
    HardSoftScore totalScore = (HardSoftScore) indictment.getScore();
----

An example from a `*.java` file in OptaPlanner 8:

[source,java]
----
    ScoreExplanation<TimeTable, HardSoftScore> explanation = scoreManager.explainScore(timeTable);
    Map<Object, Indictment<HardSoftScore>> indictmentMap = scoreExplanation.getIndictmentMap();
    Indictment<HardSoftScore> indictment = indictmentMap.get(lesson);
    HardSoftScore totalScore = indictment.getScore();
----


[discrete]
== `ConstraintMatchAwareIncrementalScoreCalculator`: generic type `Score` added
*Minor*

The interface `ConstraintMatchAwareIncrementalScoreCalculator`
now also has a generic type parameter for `Score` to avoid raw type usages of `ConstraintMatchTotal` and `Indictment`.

An example from a `*.java` file in OptaPlanner 7:

[source,java]
----
public class MachineReassignmentIncrementalScoreCalculator
        implements ConstraintMatchAwareIncrementalScoreCalculator<MachineReassignment> {

    @Override
    public Collection<ConstraintMatchTotal> getConstraintMatchTotals() {
        ...
    }


    @Override
    public Map<Object, Indictment> getIndictmentMap() {
        ...
    }

}
----

An example from a `*.java` file in OptaPlanner 8:

[source,java]
----
public class MachineReassignmentIncrementalScoreCalculator
        implements ConstraintMatchAwareIncrementalScoreCalculator<MachineReassignment, HardSoftLongScore> {

    @Override
    public Collection<ConstraintMatchTotal<HardSoftLongScore>> getConstraintMatchTotals() {
        ...
    }


    @Override
    public Map<Object, Indictment<HardSoftLongScore>> getIndictmentMap() {
        ...
    }

}

[discrete]
== `AbstractCustomPhaseCommand` was removed
*Minor*, *Public API*

The abstract class `AbstractCustomPhaseCommand` was removed.
Any class that extends it should directly implement the `CustomPhaseCommand` interface.

An example from a `*.java` file in OptaPlanner 7:

[source,java]
----
public class DinnerPartySolutionInitializer extends AbstractCustomPhaseCommand<DinnerParty> {

    @Override
    public void changeWorkingSolution(ScoreDirector<DinnerParty> scoreDirector) {
        ...
    }

}
----

An example from a `*.java` file in OptaPlanner 8:

[source,java]

    public void changeWorkingSolution(ScoreDirector<DinnerParty> scoreDirector) {
        ...
    }

}
----

[discrete]
== Score calculators moved to the public API
*Major*

The interfaces `EasyScoreCalculator`, `IncrementalScoreCalculator`, and `ConstraintMatchAwareIncrementalScoreCalculator`
have moved to a new package in the public API.
Their deprecated counterparts have been removed.
The deprecated class `org.optaplanner.core.impl.score.director.incremental.AbstractIncrementalScoreCalculator`
has also been removed.
Replace the use of the removed interfaces and classes with their counterparts in the public API.

An example from the `*EasyScoreCalculator.java*` file in OptaPlanner 7:

[source,xml]
----
  ...
  import org.optaplanner.core.impl.score.director.easy.EasyScoreCalculator;

[discrete]
== `PlannerBenchmarkFactory`: `createFromSolverFactory()` removed
*Major*, *Public API*

The `PlannerBenchmarkFactory.createFromSolverFactory()` method has been deprecated and replaced with the
`PlannerBenchmarkFactory.createFromSolverConfigXmlResource(String)` method. The `PlannerBenchmarkFactory.createFromSolverFactory()` method has been removed.


An example from a `*.java` file in OptaPlanner 7:

[source,java]
----
SolverFactory<CloudBalance> solverFactory = SolverFactory.createFromXmlResource(
        ".../cloudBalancingSolverConfig.xml");
PlannerBenchmarkFactory benchmarkFactory = PlannerBenchmarkFactory.createFromSolverFactory(solverFactory);
----

An example from a `*.java` file in OptaPlanner 8:

[source,java]
----
PlannerBenchmarkFactory benchmarkFactory = PlannerBenchmarkFactory.createFromSolverConfigXmlResource(
        ".../cloudBalancingSolverConfig.xml");
----

If you programmatically adjust the solver configuration, you can use `PlannerBenchmarkConfig.createFromSolverConfig(SolverConfig)`
and then `PlannerBenchmarkFactory.create(PlannerBenchmarkConfig)` instead.

[discrete]
== `PlannerBenchmarkFactory`: `getPlannerBenchmarkConfig()` removed
*Minor*, *Public API*

The `PlannerBenchmarkFactory.getPlannerBenchmarkConfig()` method has been deprecated and replaced with the
`PlannerBenchmarkFactory.create(PlannerBenchmarkConfig)` method.
A `PlannerBenchmarkConfig` instance is now instantiated before a `PlannerBenchmarkFactory` instance is instantiated. This order is more logical.
`PlannerBenchmarkFactory.getPlannerBenchmarkConfig()` has been removed.

An example from a `*.java` file in OptaPlanner 7:

[source,java]
----
PlannerBenchmarkFactory benchmarkFactory = PlannerBenchmarkFactory.createFromXmlResource(
        ".../cloudBalancingBenchmarkConfig.xml");
PlannerBenchmarkConfig benchmarkConfig = benchmarkFactory.getPlannerBenchmarkConfig();
...
PlannerBenchmark benchmark = benchmarkFactory.buildPlannerBenchmark();

[discrete]
== XML <plannerBenchmark/> root element now belongs to the https://www.optaplanner.org/xsd/benchmark namespace
*Minor*, *Public API*

OptaPlanner now provides an XML Schema Definition (XSD) for the benchmark configuration.
Although OptaPlanner keeps compatibility with earlier versions of the existing XML configuration,
migrating to the XSD is strongly recommended because OptaPlanner might support only valid configuration XML in the future.

An example from the `*BenchmarkConfig.xml` file in OptaPlanner 7:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<plannerBenchmark>
  ...
</plannerBenchmark>
----

An example from the `*BenchmarkConfig.xml` file in OptaPlanner 8:

[source,xml]

  ...
</plannerBenchmark>
----

Using the XSD might require reordering some of the XML elements of the configuration.
Use code completion in the IDE to migrate to a valid XML.

== `ProblemBenchmarksConfig`: `xStreamAnnotatedClass` removed
*Major*, *Public API*

The `<xStreamAnnotatedClass/>` has been removed from the `<problemBenchmarks/>` configuration together with the corresponding
`getXStreamAnnotatedClassList()` and `setXStreamAnnotatedClassList()` methods in the `ProblemBenchmarksConfig` class.

== `BenchmarkAggregatorFrame`: `createAndDisplay(PlannerBenchmarkFactory)` removed
*Minor*

The `BenchmarkAggregatorFrame.createAndDisplay(PlannerBenchmarkFactory)` method has been deprecated and replaced with the `BenchmarkAggregatorFrame.createAndDisplayFromXmlResource(String)` method. The `BenchmarkAggregatorFrame.createAndDisplay(PlannerBenchmarkFactory)` method has been removed.

An example from a `*.java` file in OptaPlanner 7:

[source,java]
----
PlannerBenchmarkFactory benchmarkFactory = PlannerBenchmarkFactory.createFromXmlResource(
        ".../cloudBalancingBenchmarkConfig.xml");
BenchmarkAggregatorFrame.createAndDisplay(benchmarkFactory);

If you programmatically adjust the benchmark configuration, you can use `BenchmarkAggregatorFrame.createAndDisplay(PlannerBenchmarkConfig)` instead.

[discrete]
== Removed JavaScript expression support in configuration
*Minor*

Various elements of both the solver configuration and benchmark configuration no longer support nested
JavaScript expressions.
You must replace these with either auto-configuration or with integer constants.

== Removed the deprecated variable listeners
*Major*, *Public API*

The deprecated interface `VariableListener` from package `org.optaplanner.core.impl.domain.variable.listener` has ben removed,
