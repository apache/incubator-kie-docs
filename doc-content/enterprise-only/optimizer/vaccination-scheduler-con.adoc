= How the OptaPlanner vaccination appointment scheduler works

There are two main approaches to scheduling appointments. The system can either let a person choose an appointment slot (user-selects) or the system assigns a slot and tells the person when and where to attend (system-automatically-assigns). The OptaPlanner vaccination appointment scheduler uses the system-automatically-assigns approach. With the OptaPlanner vaccination appointment scheduler, you can create an application where people provide their information to the system and the system assigns an appointment.

Characteristics of this approach:

* Appointment slots are allocated based on priority.
* The system allocates the best appointment time and location based on preconfigured planning constraints.
* The system is not overwhelmed by a large number of users competing for a limited number of appointments.

This approach solves the problem of vaccinating as many people as possible by using planning constraints to create a score for each person. The person’s score determines when they get an appointment. The higher the person’s score, the better chance they have of receiving an earlier appoi
