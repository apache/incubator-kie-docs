= Pinned planning entities

If you are continuously planning on a daily basis, there will be appointments within the two week period that are already allocated to people. To ensure that appointments are not double-booked, OptaPlanner marks existing appointments as allocated by pinning them. Pinning is used to anchor one or more specific assignments and force OptaPlanner to schedule around those fixed assignments.  A pinned planning entity, such as an appointment, does not change during solving.

Whether an entity is pinned or not is determined by the appointment state. An appointment can have five states : `Open`, `Invited`, `Accepted`, `Rejected`, or `Rescheduled`.

NOTE: You do not actually see these states directly in the quick start demo code because the OptaPlanner engine is only interested in whether the appointment is pinned or not.

You need to be able to plan around appointments that have already been scheduled. An appointment with the `Invited` or `Accepted` state is pinned. Appointments with the `Open`, `Reschedule`, and `Rejected` state are not pinned and are available for scheduling.

In this example, when the solver runs it searches across the entire two week planning window in both the published and draft ranges. The solver considers any unpinned entities, appointments with the `Open`, `Reschedule`, or `Rejected` states, in addition to the unscheduled input data, to find the optimal solution. If the solver is run daily, you will see a new day added to the schedule before you run the solver.

Notice that the appointments on the new day have been assigned and Amy and Edna who were previously scheduled in the draft part of the planning window are now scheduled in the published part of the window. This was possible because Gus and Hugo requested a reschedule. This will not cause any confusion because Amy and Edna were never notified about their draft dates. Now, because they have appointments in the published section of the planning window, they will be notified and asked to accept or reject their appointments, and their appointments are now pinned.
