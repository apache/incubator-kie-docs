= NP_completeness in planning problems

The provided use cases are _probably_ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-complete[NP-complete or NP-hard], which means the following statements apply:

* It is easy to verify a given solution to a problem in reasonable time.
* There is no simple way to find the optimal solution of a problem in reasonable time.


The implication is that solving your problem is probably harder than you anticipated, because the two common techniques will not suffice:

* A brute force algorithm (even a more advanced variant) will take too long.
* A quick algorithm, for example in the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_packing_problem[bin packing problem], _putting in the largest items first_ will return a solution that is far from optimal.

By using advanced optimization algorithms, {PLANNER_SHORT} finds a good solution in reasonable time for such planning problems.
