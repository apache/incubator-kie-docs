= Score Configuration

{PLANNER_SHORT} will search for the `Solution` with the highest ``Score``.
This example uses a ``HardSoftScore``, which means {PLANNER_SHORT} will look for the solution with no hard constraints broken (fulfill hardware requirements) and as little as possible soft constraints broken (minimize maintenance cost).

You can define constraints using plain Java, Drools, or the OptaPlanner ConstraintStream API.  For information about the ConstraintStream API, see xref:business-optimizr-define-contraints-proc_business-optimizer-spring-boot[].
