= Getting started with Java solvers: A cloud balancing example

An example demonstrates development of a basic {PLANNER} solver using Java code.

Suppose your company owns a number of cloud computers and needs to run a number of processes on those computers. You must assign each process to a computer.

The following hard constraints must be fulfilled:

* Every computer must be able to handle the minimum hardware requirements of the sum of its processes:
** **CPU capacity**: The CPU power of a computer must be at least the sum of the CPU power required by the processes assigned to that computer.
** **Memory capacity**: The RAM memory of a computer must be at least the sum of the RAM memory required by the processes assigned to that computer.
** **Network capacity**: The network bandwidth of a computer must be at least the sum of the network bandwidth required by the processes assigned to that computer.

The following soft constraints should be optimized:

* Each computer that has one or more processes assigned incurs a maintenance cost which is fixed for each computer.
** **Cost**: Minimize the total maintenance cost.

This problem is a form of __bin packing__.
In the following simplified example, we assign four processes to two computers with two constraints (CPU and RAM) with a simple algorithm:

The simple algorithm used here is the _First Fit Decreasing_ algorithm, which assigns the bigger processes first and assigns the smaller processes to the remaining space.
As you can see, it is not optimal, because it does not leave enough room to assign the yellow process ``D``.

{PLANNER_SHORT} finds a more optimal solution by using additional, smarter algorithms.
It also scales: both in data (more processes, more computers) and constraints (more hardware requirements, other constraints).

The following summary applies to this example, as well as to an advanced implementation with more constraints that is described in <<ex-machineReassignment-ref>>:
