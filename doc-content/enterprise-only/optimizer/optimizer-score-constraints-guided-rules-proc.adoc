= Define score constraints using the guided rules designer


To solve an optimization problem, you need to define score constraints that evaluate your solution.
{PLANNER} integrates with the guided rules designer and provides score modifiers, which are used by the engine during the solving process.

Score modifiers can be accessed in the action selector (image:optimizer/5686.png[]) of the *THEN* (right-hand side) section of a rule, provided the planning solution is defined within the project.

Use the following procedure to create a new score constraint using the guided rules designer.


.Prerequisite

You have defined a https://docs.jboss.org/optaplanner/release/latest/optaplanner-docs/html_single/index.html#solutionClass[Planning Solution] by creating a class in the domain editor and selecting `Planning Solution`. See <<optimizer-domain-editor-con>> for more information.

.Procedure
. Open the project *Assets* screen by clicking *Menu* -> *Projects*, and clicking on your project to open it. 
. Click *Add Asset* in the upper-right corner.
. Select *Guided Rule* from the drop-down menu.
. In the *Create new Guided Rule* window, enter a name for the rule and click *Ok*.
. If you want to extend a score constraint you have already created, click the drop-down box next to *EXTEND* and select the rule from the list.
. Click the plus icon (image:optimizer/5686.png[]) on the right side of the `WHEN` section to add a condition.
. Once the action is selected, Business Optimizer score input appears on the *THEN* (right-hand side) section of the rule.
+
The following {PLANNER} actions are available in the guided rules designer:

* *Modify a single score level* - use the action to modify only one score component (e.g. hard score)
* *Modify multiple score levels* - use the action to modify multiple score components at the same time (e.g. hard and soft score)

. Insert the value of a constraint into the text input.
. Click *Validate* to verify the correctness of the inserted value.
