= Designing a domain model

To create a domain model, define all the objects that represent the input data for the problem. In this example, the objects are processes and computers. 

A separate object in the domain model must represent a full data set of the problem, which contains the input data as well as a solution. In this example, this object holds a list of computers and a list of processes. Each process is assigned to a computer; the distribution of processes between computers is the solution.

.Procedure
. Draw a class diagram of your domain model. 
. Normalize it to remove duplicate data.
. Write down some _sample instances_ for each class. Sample instances are entity properties that are relevant for planning purposes.

* ``Computer``: Represents a computer with certain hardware and maintenance costs. 
+
In this example, the sample instances for the `Computer` class are `cpuPower`, `memory`, `networkBandwidth`, `cost`. 
* ``Process``: Represents a process with a demand. Needs to be assigned to a `Computer` by Planner. 
+
Sample instances for ``Process`` are `requiredCpuPower`, `requiredMemory`, and `requiredNetworkBandwidth`.
* ``CloudBalance``: Represents the distribution of processes between computers. Contains every `Computer` and `Process` for a certain data set. 
+
For an object representing the full data set and solution, a sample instance holding the _score_ must be present. {PLANNER_SHORT} can calculate and compare the scores for different solutions; the solution with the highest score is the optimal solution. Therefore, the sample instance for `CloudBalance` is `score`.

. Determine which relationships (or fields) change during planning:

* _Planning entity_: The class (or classes) that {PLANNER_SHORT} can change during solving. In this example, it is the class ``Process``, because we can move processes to different computers.
** A class representing input data that {PLANNER_SHORT} can not change is known as a _problem fact_. 
* _Planning variable_: The property (or properties) of a planning entity class that changes during solving. In this example, it is the property `computer` on the class ``Process``.
* _Planning solution_: The class that represents a solution to the problem. This class must represent the full data set and contain all planning entities. In this example that is the class ``CloudBalance``.

In the UML class diagram below, the {PLANNER_SHORT} concepts are already annotated:

You can find the class definitions for this example in the `examples/sources/src/main/java/org/optaplanner/examples/cloudbalancing/domain` directory.
