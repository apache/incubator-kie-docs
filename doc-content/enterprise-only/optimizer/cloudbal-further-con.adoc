= Further development of the solver
Now that this example works, you can try developing it further.
For example, you can enrich the domain model and add extra constraints such as these:

* Each `Process` belongs to a ``Service``. A computer might crash, so processes running the same service should (or must) be assigned to different computers.
* Each `Computer` is located in a ``Building``. A building might burn down, so processes of the same services should (or must) be assigned to computers in different buildings.
