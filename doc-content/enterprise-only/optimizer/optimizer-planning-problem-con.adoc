= Planning problems


A _planning problem_ has an optimal goal, based on limited resources and under specific constraints. Optimal goals can be any number of things, such as:

* Maximized profits - the optimal goal results in the highest possible profit.
* Minimized ecological footprint - the optimal goal has the least amount of environmental impact.
* Maximized satisfaction for employees or customers - the optimal goal prioritizes the needs of employees or customers.

The ability to achieve these goals relies on the number of resources available. For example, the following resources might be limited:

* The number of people
* Amount of time
* Budget
* Physical assets, for example, machinery, vehicles, computers, buildings, and so on

You must also take into account the specific constraints related to these resources, such as the number of hours a person works, their ability to use certain machines, or compatibility between pieces of equipment. 
 
{PLANNER} helps Java programmers solve constraint satisfaction problems efficiently. It combines optimization heuristics and metaheuristics with efficient score calculation.
