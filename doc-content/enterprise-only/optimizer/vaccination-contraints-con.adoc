= OptaPlanner vaccination appointment scheduler constraints

OptaPlanner vaccination appointment scheduler constraints are either hard, medium, or soft:

* Hard constraints cannot be broken. If any hard constraint is broken, the plan is unfeasible and cannot be executed:
** Capacity: Do not over-book vaccine capacity at any time at any location.
** Vaccine max age: If a vaccine has a maximum age, do not administer it to people who at the time of the first dose vaccination are older than the vaccine maximum age. Ensure people are given a vaccine type appropriate for their age. For example, do not assign a 75 year old person an appointment for a vaccine that has a maximum age restriction of 65 years.
** Required vaccine type: Use the required vaccine type. For example, the second dose of a vaccine must be the same vaccine type as the first dose.
** Ready date: Administer the vaccine on or after the specified date. For example, if a person receives a second dose, do not administer it before the recommended earliest possible vaccination date for the specific vaccine type, for example 26 days after the first dose.
** Due date: Administer the vaccine on or before the specified date. For example, if a person receives a second dose, administer it before the recommended vaccination final due date for the specific vaccine, for example three months after the first dose.
** Restrict maximum travel distance: Assign each person to one of a group of vaccination centers nearest to them. This is typically one of three centers. This restriction is calculated by travel time, not distance, so a person that lives in an urban area usually has a lower maximum distance to travel than a person living in a rural area.

* Medium constraints decide who does not get an appointment when there is not enough capacity to assign appointments to everyone. This is called overconstrained planning:
** Schedule second dose vaccinations: Do not leave any second dose vaccination appointments unassigned unless the ideal date falls outside of the planning window.
** Schedule people based on their priority rating: Each person has a priority rating. This is typically their age but it can be much higher if they are, for example, a health care worker. Leave only people with the lowest priority ratings unassigned. They will be considered in the next run. This constraint is softer than the previous constraint because the second dose is always prioritized over priority rating.
* Soft constraints should not be broken:
** Preferred vaccination center: If a person has a preferred vaccination center, give them an appointment at that center.
** Distance: Minimize the distance that a person must travel to their assigned vaccination center.
** Ideal date: Administer the vaccine on or as close to the specified date as possible. For example, if a person receives a second dose, administer it on the ideal date for the specific vaccine, for example 28 days after the first dose. This constraint is softer than the distance constraint to avoid sending people halfway across the country just to be one day closer to their ideal date.
** Priority rating: Schedule people with a higher priority rating earlier in the planning window. This constraint is softer than the distance constraint to avoid sending people halfway across the country. This constraint is also softer than the ideal date constraint because the second dose is prioritized over priority rating.

Hard constraints are weighted against other hard constraints. Soft constraints are weighted against other soft constraints. However, hard constraints always take precedence over medium and soft constraints. If a hard constraint is broken, then the plan is not feasible. But if no hard constraints are broken then soft and medium constraints are considered in order to determine priority.
Because there are often more people than available appointment slots, you must prioritize. Second dose appointments are always assigned first to avoid creating a backlog that would overwhelm your system later. After that, people are assigned based on their priority rating. Everyone starts with a priority rating that is their age. Doing this prioritizes older people over younger people. After that, people that are in specific priority groups receive, for example, a few hundred extra points. This  varies based on the priority of their group. For example, nurses might receive an extra 1000 points. This way, older nurses are prioritized over younger nurses and young nurses are prioritized over people who are not nurses. The following table illustrates this concept:
