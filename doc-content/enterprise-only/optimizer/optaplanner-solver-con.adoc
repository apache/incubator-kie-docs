= The OptaPlanner solver

At the core of OptaPlanner is the solver, the engine that takes the problem data set and overlays the planning constraints and configurations. The problem data set includes all of the information about the people, the vaccines, and the vaccination centers. The solver works through the various combinations of data and eventually determines an optimized appointment schedule with people assigned to vaccination appointments at a specific center.  The following illustration shows a schedule that the solver created:
