= The `CloudBalance` Class

The `CloudBalance` class has a [path]_@PlanningSolution_ annotation.

This class holds a list of all computers and processes. It represents both the planning problem and (if it is initialized) the planning solution. 

The `CloudBalance` class has the following key attributes:

* It holds a collection of processes that {PLANNER_SHORT} can change. We annotate the getter `getProcessList()` with ``@PlanningEntityCollectionProperty``, so that {PLANNER_SHORT} can retrieve the processes that it can change. To save a solution, {PLANNER_SHORT} initializes a new instance of the class with the list of changed processes.

. It also has a `@PlanningScore` annotated property ``score``, which is the `Score` of that solution in its current state.
{PLANNER_SHORT} automatically updates it when it calculates a `Score` for a solution instance; therefore, this property needs a setter.

. Especially for score calculation with Drools, the property `computerList` needs to be annotated with a `@ProblemFactCollectionProperty` so that {PLANNER_SHORT} can retrieve a list of computers (problem facts) and make it available to the Drools engine.
