=== `ConstraintMatch.compareTo()` inconsistent with `equals()`
*Minor*

The `equals()` override in `ConstraintMatch` has been removed.
As a result, two different `ConstraintMatch` instances are never considered equal.
This contrasts with the `compareTo()` method, which continues to consider two instances equal
if all their field values are equal.
