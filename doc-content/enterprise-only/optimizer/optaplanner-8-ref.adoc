The changes listed in this section were made between OptaPlanner 8.2.0 and OptaPlanner 8.3.0.

[discrete]
=== `ConstraintMatch.compareTo()` inconsistent with `equals()`
*Minor*

The `equals()` override in `ConstraintMatch` has been removed.
As a result, two different `ConstraintMatch` instances are never considered equal.
This contrasts with the `compareTo()` method, which continues to consider two instances equal
if all their field values are equal.

The `equals()` override in `ConstraintMatch` has been removed.
in order to not fail on constraints with non-distinct matches.
