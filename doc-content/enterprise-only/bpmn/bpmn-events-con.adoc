= BPMN2 events in process designer 
An event is something that happens to a business process.  BPMN2 supports three categories of events: 

* Start
* End
* Intermediate 

Within these categories, events are differentiated as either catching an event trigger or throwing an event result.

The following business process diagram shows examples of events:

In this example, the following events occurred:

* The ATM Card Inserted signal start event is triggered when the signal is received.
* The timeout intermediate event is an interrupting event based on a timer trigger.  This means that the Wait for PIN subprocess is canceled when the timer event is triggered. 
* The normal (none) end event ends the process.
