= BPMN2 events in process designer 
An event is something that happens to a business process.  There are three categories of events: 
* start
* end
* intermediate.  

Within these categories, events are differentiated as either catching an event trigger or throwing an event result.

The following business process diagram shows examples of events:

* The ATM Card Inserted signal start event is triggered when the signal is received.
* The Time Out intermediate event is an interrupting event based on a timer trigger.  This means that the Wait for PIN subprocess will be canceled when the timer event is triggered. COMMENT: In what situation? What will trigger this? Need call outs.
* The normal (None) end event ends the process.
