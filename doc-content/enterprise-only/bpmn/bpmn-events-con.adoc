= BPMN2 events in process designer
An event is something that happens to a business process.  BPMN2 supports three categories of events:

* Start
* End
* Intermediate

A start event catches an event trigger, an end event throws an event trigger, and an intermediate event can both catch and throw event triggers.

The following business process diagram shows examples of events:

In this example, the following events occurred:

* The ATM Card Inserted signal start event is triggered when the signal is received.
* The timeout intermediate event is an interrupting event based on a timer trigger.  This means that the Wait for PIN subprocess is canceled when the timer event is triggered.
* Depending on the inputs to the process, either end event associated with the Validate User Pin task or the end event associated with the Inform User of Timeout task ends the process.
