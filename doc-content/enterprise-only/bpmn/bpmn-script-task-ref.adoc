= Script task

image::BPMN2/bpmn-script-task.png[]

A Script Task represents a script to be executed during the process execution.

The associated [property]``Script`` can access process variables and global variables. When using a Script Task:

* Avoid low-level implementation details in the process. A Script Task could be used to manipulate variables, but consider using a Service Task when modelling more complex operations.
* The script should be executed immediately. If there is the possibility that the execution could take some time, use an asynchronous Service Task.
* Avoid contacting external services through a Script Task. It would be interacting with external services without notifying the engine, which can be problematic. Model communication with an external service using a Service Task.
* Scripts should not throw exceptions. Runtime exceptions should be caught and managed, for example, inside the script or transformed into signals or errors that can then be handled inside the process.

When a Script Task is reached during execution, the script is executed and the outgoing flow is taken.
