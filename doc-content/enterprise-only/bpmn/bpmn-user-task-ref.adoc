= User task
COMMENT: Should the Task section have an example of how/why the specific task should be used.  And maybe note areas where it is not a good idea.  Can this be some sort of table?

User tasks are tasks in the process workflow that cannot be performed automatically by the system and therefore requires an intervention of a human user, the actor.

On execution, the User Task element is instantiated as a task that appears in the list of tasks of one or multiple actors. If a User Task element defines the `Groups` attribute, it is displayed in task lists of all users that are members of the group. Any user who is a member of the group can claim the task.

After it is claimed, the task disappears from the task list of the other users.

User Task is implemented as a domain-specific task and serves as a base for your custom tasks.
