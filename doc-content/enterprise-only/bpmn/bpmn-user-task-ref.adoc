= User task

image::BPMN2/bpmn-user-task.png[]

User tasks are tasks in the process workflow that cannot be performed automatically by the system and therefore requires an intervention of a human user, the actor.

On execution, the User Task element is instantiated as a task that appears in the list of tasks of one or multiple actors. If a User Task element defines the `Groups` attribute, it is displayed in task lists of all users that are members of the group. Any user who is a member of the group can claim the task.

Once claimed, the task disappears from the task list of the other users.

User Task is implemented as a domain-specific task and serves as a base for your custom tasks.

[float]
== Actions

The following actions can be performed on a User Task:

* Delegate
* Forward
* Claim
* Start
* Save
* Complete

[float]
== Properties

Actors::
A comma-separated list of users who can perform the generated task.

Content::
The data associated with this task. This attribute does not affect TaskService behavior.

CreatedBy::
The name of the user or ID of the process that created the task.

Groups::
A comma-separated list of groups who can perform the generated task.

Locale::
The locale for which the element is defined. This property is not used by the {ENGINE} at the moment.

//Notifications::
//A definition of notification applied to the User Task. For further information, see <<_notification>>. Not in PAM 7.1.

Priority::
An integer value defining the User Task priority. The value influences the User Task ordering in the user Task list and the simulation outcome.

//Reassignment::
//The definition of escalation applied to the User Task. For further information, see <<_reassignment>>. Not in PAM 7.1.


ScriptLanguage::
The language of the script. Choose between [property]``Java``, [property]``MVEL``, or `Javascript`.

Skippable::
A Boolean value that defines if the User Task can be skipped. If ``true``, the actor of the User Task can decide not to complete it and the User Task is never executed.

Task Name::
Name of the User Task generated during runtime. It is displayed in the task list in {CENTRAL}.


Any other displayed attributes are used by features not restricted to the User Task element and are described in the chapters dealing with the particular mechanism.


== User Task lifecycle


When a User Task element is triggered during process execution, a User Task instance is created. The User Task instance execution is preformed by the User Task service of the Task Execution Engine. The Process instance continues the execution only when the associated User Task has been completed or aborted.

The user task has the following life cycle:

* When the process instance enters the User Task element, the User Task is the `Created` stage.
* This is usually a transient state and the User Task enters the `Ready` state immediately. The task appears in the task list of all the actors that are allowed to execute the task.
* When one of the actors claims the User Task, the User Task becomes ``Reserved``. If a User Task has only one potential actor, it is automatically assigned to that actor upon creation.
* When the user who has claimed the User Task starts the execution by clicking *Start* in the task *Work* tab, the User Task status changes to ``InProgress``.
* When the user has performed the task and clicked *Complete*, the status changes to `Completed` or `Failed` depending on the execution outcome.

The User Task lifecycle can include other statuses if the User Task is reassigned (delegated or escalated), revoked, suspended, stopped, or skipped.
