= User task
User tasks are tasks in the process workflow that cannot be performed automatically by the system and therefore requires an intervention of a human user, the actor.

On execution, the User Task element is instantiated as a task that appears in the list of tasks of one or multiple actors. If a User Task element defines the `Groups` attribute, it is displayed in task lists of all users that are members of the group. Any user who is a member of the group can claim the task.

After it is claimed, the task disappears from the task list of the other users.

User Task is implemented as a domain-specific task and serves as a base for your custom tasks.
