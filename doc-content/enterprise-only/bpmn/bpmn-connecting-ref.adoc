= Connecting objects
Connecting object connect two elements. There are two main types of Connecting object:

* Sequence Flow, which connect Flow elements of a Process and define the flow of the execution (transport the token from one element to another)
* Association Flow, which connect any Process elements but have no execution semantics


A sequence flow represents the transition between two flow elements. It establishes an oriented relationship between activities, events, and gateways, and defines their execution order.

.Properties

*Condition Expression*
When this condition evaluates to `true`, the workflow takes the sequence flow.

If a sequence flow has a gateway element as its source, you need to define a conditional expression that is evaluated before the sequence flow is taken.
If evaluated to `false`, the workflow attempts to switch to another sequence flow.
If evaluated to `true`, the sequence flow is taken.

When defining the condition in Java, make sure to return a boolean value:

[source,java]
----
return <expression resolving to boolean>;
----

You can use either Java, Javascript, MVEL, or Drools to define the condition expression.


[NOTE]
====
When defining a Condition Expression, make sure to call process and global variables.
You can also call the [var]``kcontext`` variable, which holds the process instance information.
