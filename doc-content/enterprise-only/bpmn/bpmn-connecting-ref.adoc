= BPMN2 connecting objects in process designer 
Connecting objects create an association between two BPMN2 elements. When the connecting object is directed, the association is sequential and indicates that one of the elements is executed immediately before the other, within an instance of the process. Connecting objects can start and end at the top, bottom, right or left of the process elements being associated. The OMG BPMN2 specification allows for the process modeler to use their discretion, placing connecting object in a way that makes the process behavior easy to understand and follow.

There are two main types of connecting object:

* Sequence flows: 
Connect elements of a process and define the order in which those elements are executed within an instance.
* Association flows image:BPMN2/leg_grn_sm.png[]: 
Connects the elements of a process without execution semantics. Association flows can be undirected or unidirectional.
