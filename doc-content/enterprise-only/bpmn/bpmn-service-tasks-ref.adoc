Service task is a task that uses a service, such as a mail service, web service, or another service.

{PRODUCT} contains the following predefined service tasks:

* A `WebService` task for invoking a web service from a BPMN2 process.
* An `Email` task for sending emails through a mail server.
* A `Log` task that calls the `SystemOutWorkItemHandler` class.
* A `REST` task for sending REST calls.

Because the tasks extend the service task, their attributes are implemented as `Data Input Set` assignments, and `Data Output Set` assignments, not as separate properties.
