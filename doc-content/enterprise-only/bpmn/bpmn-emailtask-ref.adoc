[id='registering-emailworkitemhandler-proc']
= Registering EmailWorkItemHandler

`EmailWorkItemHandler` is the work item handler implementation of the Email Service task. The Email work item is included in the work item definition file by default, however `EmailWorkItemHandler` is not a part of the default `kie-deployment-descriptor.xml` file, and therefore must be explicitly registered by the user.

To register `EmailWorkItemHandler`:

. Open the Project Editor and click *Project Settings: Project General Settings -> Deployment descriptor*  from the menu.

. Scroll down to the Work Item handlers list and click *Add* to add the `EmailWorkItemHandler` to the list. For example:
+
[source,java]
----
new org.jbpm.process.workitem.email.EmailWorkItemHandler("localhost","25","me@localhost","password");
----
+
Alternatively, email server parameters can be supplied using a constructor in the `ProcessMain.java` file:
+
[source,java]
----
EmailWorkItemHandler emailWorkItemHandler = new EmailWorkItemHandler("localhost", "1125", "", "",true); ksession.getWorkItemManager().registerWorkItemHandler("Email", emailWorkItemHandler );

[id='configuring-email-deadline-proc']
= Configuring Deadline

You can configure the Deadline email feature in two ways:

. *Mail Session on Container Level*
+
With this method, the Deadline email feature uses `EmailSessionProducer` to look up the `mail/jbpmMailSession` using JNDI. The following example is for Red Hat JBoss EAP `standalone.xml`:
+
[source,xml]
----
<system-properties>
...
  <property name="org.kie.mail.session" value="java:jboss/mail/mail/jbpmMailSession"/>
...
</system-properties>
...
<subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:mail:1.2">
  <mail-session name="default" jndi-name="mail/jbpmMailSession" >
    <smtp-server outbound-socket-binding-ref="mail-smtp" tls="true">
      <login name="email@gmail.com" password="___"/>
    </smtp-server>
  </mail-session>
</subsystem>
...
<outbound-socket-binding name="mail-smtp">
  <remote-destination host="smtp.gmail.com" port="587"/>
</outbound-socket-binding>
----

. *Using email.properties*
+
If the `mail/jbpmMailSession` is not found, {PRODUCT} searches for `/email.properties` on the class path with content similar to the following:
+
[source]
----
mail.smtp.host=localhost
mail.smtp.port=25
mail.from=xxx@xxx.com
mail.replyto=xxx@xxx.com
