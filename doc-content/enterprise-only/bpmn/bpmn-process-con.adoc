[id='bpmn-process-con']
A process is a named element defined in a process definition. It exists in a knowledge base and is identified by its ID.

A process represents a namespace and serves as a container for a set of modeling elements. it contains elements that specify the execution workflow of a business process or its parts using flow objects and flows. Every process must contain at least one start event and one end event.

A process is accompanied by its BPMN Diagram, which is also part of the process definition, and defines the visualisation of the process execution workflow, for example in the Process Designer.

Apart from the execution workflow and process attributes, a process can define process variables, which store process data during runtime.
