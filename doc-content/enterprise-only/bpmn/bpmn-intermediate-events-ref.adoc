= Intermediate events 


An intermediate event handles a particular situation that occurs during process execution. The situation is a trigger for an intermediate event.

In a process, intermediate events can be placed as follows:

On an activity boundary with one outgoing flow
If the event occurs while the activity is being executed, the event triggers its execution to the outgoing flow. One activity may have multiple boundary intermediate events. Note that depending on the behavior you require from the activity with the boundary intermediate event, you can use either of the following intermediate event types:

* Interrupting: The activity execution is interrupted and the execution of the intermediate event is triggered.
* Non-interrupting: The intermediate event is triggered and the activity execution continues.

[[_message_intermediate_event]]
.Message

A Message Intermediate Event is an intermediate event that allows you to manage a message object. Use one of the following events:

* *Throwing Message Intermediate Event* produces a message object based on the defined properties.
* *Catching Message Intermediate Event* listens for a message object with the defined properties.


[[_timer_intermediate_event]]
.Timer
A timer intermediate event allows you to delay workflow execution or to trigger the workflow execution periodically. It represents a timer that can trigger one or multiple times after a given period of time. When triggered, the timer condition, that is the defined time, is checked and the outgoing flow is taken. 
When placed in the process workflow, a timer intermediate event has one incoming flow and one outgoing flow. Its execution starts when the incoming flow transfers to the event. When placed on an activity boundary, the execution is triggered at the same time as the activity execution.

The timer is canceled if the timer element is canceled, for example by completing or aborting the enclosing process instance.

* Attributes
*Time Cycle*
Repeatedly triggers the timer after a specific time period. If the period is ``0``, the timer is triggered only once.

*Time Cycle Language*
Set to `None` for the default interval, or `Cron` for the following `Time Cycle` property format: 
+
[source]
----
[\#d][\#h][\#m][\#s][#[ms]]
----

*Time Duration*
Marks the timer as a one-time expiration timer. It is the delay after which the timer fires. Possible values are a String interval, a process variable, or the ISO-8601 date format.

*Time Date*
Triggers the timer at the specified date and time in the ISO-8601 date format.


[[_conditional_intermediate_event]]
.Conditional


A Conditional Intermediate Event is an intermediate event with a boolean condition as its trigger. The event triggers further workflow execution when the condition evaluates to `true` and its outgoing flow is taken.

The event must define the [property]``Expression`` property. When placed in the process workflow, a Conditional Intermediate Event has one incoming flow, one outgoing flow, and its execution starts when the incoming flow transfers to the event. When placed on an activity boundary, the execution is triggered at the same time as the activity execution. Note that if the event is non-interrupting, the event triggers continuously while the condition is ``true``.


* Attributes

Expression
A Boolean condition that triggers the execution when evaluated to `true`.

Language
A language of the `Expression` attribute.


[[_signal_intermediate_event]]
.Signal


A Signal Intermediate Event enables you to produce or consume a signal object. Use either of the following:

* *Throwing Signal Intermediate Event* produces a signal object based on the defined properties.
* *Catching Signal Intermediate Event* listens for a signal object with the defined properties.

[[_error_intermediate_event]]
.Error


An Error Intermediate Event is an intermediate event that can be used only on an activity boundary. It allows the process to react to an Error End Event in the respective activity.
The activity must not be atomic. When the activity finishes with an Error End Event that produces an error object with the respective `ErrorCode` property, the Error Intermediate Event catches the error object and execution continues to its outgoing flow.



[[_compensation_intermediate_event]]
.Compensation


A compensation intermediate event is a boundary event attached to an activity in a transaction sub-process. It can finish with a compensation end event or a cancel end event. The compensation intermediate event must be associated with a flow, which is connected to the compensation activity.

The activity associated with the boundary compensation intermediate event is executed if the transaction sub-process finishes with the compensation end event. The execution continues with the respective flow.

[[_escalation_intermediate_event]]
.Escalation


An Escalation Intermediate Event is an intermediate event that allows you to produce or consume an escalation object. Depending on the action the event element should perform, you need to use either of the following:

* *Throwing Escalation Intermediate Event* produces an escalation object based on the defined properties.
* *Catching Escalation Intermediate Event* listens for an escalation object with the defined properties.
