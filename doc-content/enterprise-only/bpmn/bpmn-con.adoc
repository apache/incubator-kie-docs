= Business Process Modeling and Notation Version 2.0
The Business Process Modeling and Notation Version 2.0 (BPMN2) specification is an Object Management Group (OMG) specification that defines standards for graphically representing a business process, defines execution semantics for the elements, and provides process definitions in XML format.

A process is defined or determined by its process definition. It exists in a knowledge base and is identified by its ID.

|===
|Label
|Description

| *Name*
| Enter the name of the process.

| *Documentation*
| Describes the process. The text in this field is included in the process documentation, if applicable.

| *ID*
| Enter an identifier for this process, for example `orderItems`.

| *Package*
| Enter the package location for this process in your {PRODUCT} project, for example `org.acme`.

| *ProcessType*
| Specify whether the process is public or private. (Currently not supported.)

| *Version*
| Enter the artifact version for the process.

| *Ad hoc*
| Select this option if this process is an ad hoc sub-process.

| *Process Instance Description*
| Enter a description of the purpose of the process.

| *Imports*
| Click to open the *Imports* window and add any data type classes required for your process, or you can select an already defined data type.

| *Executable*
| Select this option to make the process executable part of your {PRODUCT} project.

| *SLA Due Date*
| Enter the service level agreement (SLA) expiration date.

| *Process Variables*
a| Add any process variables for the process. Process variables are visible within the specific process instance. Process variables are initialized at process creation and destroyed on process completion. Variable tags provide greater control over variable behavior, for example whether the variable is tagged as `required` or `readonly`. For more information about variable tags, see
xref:variables-con_{context}[].

| *Metadata Attributes*
| Add any custom metadata attribute name and value that you want to use for custom event listeners, such as a listener to implement some action when a metadata attribute is present.

| *Global Variables*
|  Add any global variables for the process. Global variables are visible to all process instances and assets in a project. Global variables are typically used by business rules and constraints and are created dynamically by the rules or constraints.

A process is a container for a set of modeling elements. It contains elements that specify the execution workflow of a business process or its parts using flow objects and flows. Each process has its own BPMN2 diagram. {PRODUCT} contains the new process designer for creating BPMN2 diagrams and the legacy process designer to open the old BPMN2 diagram with `.bpmn2` extension. The new process designer has an improved layout and feature set and continues to develop. By default, the new diagrams are created in the new process designer.
