= Business Process Modeling and Notation Version 2.0
The Business Process Modeling and Notation Version 2.0 (BPMN2) specification is an Object Management Group (OMG) specification that defines standards for graphically representing a business process, defines execution semantics for the elements, and provides process definitions inXML format. 

Executable processes in BPMN2 consist of different types of nodes connected using sequence flows. The BPMN 2.0 specification defines three main node types:

* Events: Used to model the occurrence one of the following event types:

** Start event: Indicates the start of the process.
** End event: Defines the end of the process or subflow.
** Intermediate event: Indicates events that might occur during the execution of the process.
* Activities: Define different actions that must be performed during process execution. 
* Gateways: Define multiple paths in the process.
