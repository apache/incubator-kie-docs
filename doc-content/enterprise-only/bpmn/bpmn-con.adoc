= Business Process Modeling and Notation Version 2.0
The Business Process Modeling and Notation Version 2.0 (BPMN2) specification is an Object Management Group (OMG) specification that defines standards for graphically representing a business process, defines execution semantics for the elements, and provides process definitions in XML format. 

A process is a named element defined in a process definition. It exists in a knowledge base and is identified by its ID. A  process is a container for a set of modeling elements. It contains elements that specify the execution workflow of a business process or its parts using flow objects and flows. Each process has it's own BPMN2 diagram. {PRODUCT} contains the legacy process designer and the new process designer for creating BPMN2 diagrams. This guide lists the supported BPMN2 elements in each designer.
