= Business rule task 

image::BPMN2/bpmn-business-rule-task.png[]

The task defines a set of rules that need to be evaluated and fired on task execution. Any rule defined as part of the ruleflow group in a rule resource is fired.

When a Business Rule Task is reached in the process, the engine starts executing the rules with the defined ruleflow group.
When there are no more active rules with the ruleflow group, the execution continues to the next element.
During the ruleflow group execution, new activations belonging to the active ruleflow group can be added to the agenda as these are changed by the other rules.
Note that the process continues immediately to the next element if there are no active rules of the ruleflow group.

If the ruleflow group was already active, the ruleflow group remains active and the execution continues if all active rules of the ruleflow group have been completed.
