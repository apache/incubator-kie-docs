The task defines a set of rules that need to be evaluated and fired on task execution. Any rule defined as part of the rule flow group in a rule resource is fired.

When a business rule task is reached in the process, the {PROCESS_ENGINE} starts executing the rules with the defined rule flow group.
When there are no more active rules with the rule flow group, the execution continues to the next element.
During the rule flow group execution, new activations belonging to the active rule flow group can be added to the agenda as these are changed by the other rules.

If the rule flow group was already active, the rule flow group remains active and the execution continues if all active rules of the rule flow group have been completed.
