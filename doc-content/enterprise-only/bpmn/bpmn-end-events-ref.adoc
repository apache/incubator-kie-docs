= End events
End events are used to end a business process and may not have any outgoing sequence flows. There may be multiple end events in a business process. All end events, with the exception of the none and terminate end events, are throw events.

End events indicate the completion of a business process. An end event is a node that ends a particular workflow. It has one or more incoming sequence flows and no outgoing flow.

A process must contain at least one end event.

During run time, an end event finishes the process workflow. The end event can finish only the workflow that reached it, or all workflows in the process instance, depending on the end event type.

[[_none_end_event]]
.None

The none end event specifies that no other special behavior is associated with the end of the process.

[[_message_end_event]]
.Message

When a flow enters a message end event, the flow finishes and the end event produces a message as defined in its properties.

[[_signal_end_event]]
.Signal

A throwing signal end event is used to finish a process or subprocess flow. When the execution flow enters the element, the execution flow finishes and produces a signal identified by its `SignalRef` property.


[[_error_end_event]]
.Error

The throwing error end event finishes the incoming workflow, which means consumes the incoming token, and produces an error object. Any other running workflows in the process or subprocess remain uninfluenced.

[[_compensation_end_event]]
.Compensation

A compensation end event is used to finish a transaction subprocess and trigger the compensation defined by the compensation intermediate event attached to the boundary of the subprocess activities.

[[_escalation_end_event]]
.Escalation

The escalation end event finishes the incoming workflow, which means consumes the incoming token, and produces an escalation signal as defined in its properties, triggering the escalation process.

[[_terminate_end_event]]
.Terminate

The terminate end event finishes all execution flows in the specified process instance. Activities being executed are canceled. The subprocess instance terminates if it reaches a terminate end event.
