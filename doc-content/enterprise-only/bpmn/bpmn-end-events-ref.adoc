= End events 
An end event is a node that ends a particular workflow. It has one or more incoming sequence flows and no outgoing flow.

A process must contain at least one end event.

During runtime, an end event finishes the process workflow. The end event can finish only the workflow that reached it, or all workflows in the process instance, depending on the end event type.

[[_message_end_event]]
.Message

When a flow enters a Message End Event, the flow finishes and the end event produces a message as defined in its properties.

[[_signal_end_event]]
.Signal

A throwing Signal End Event is used to finish a process or sub-process flow. When the execution flow enters the element, the execution flow finishes and produces a signal identified by its [property]``SignalRef`` property.


[[_error_end_event]]
.Error

The Throwing Error End Event finishes the incoming workflow, that means consumes the incoming token, and produces an error object. Any other running workflows in the process or sub-process remain uninfluenced.


* Attributes
+
`ErrorRef`
The reference code of the produced error object.

[[_compensation_end_event]]
.Compensation

A Compensation End Event is used to finish a transaction sub-process and trigger the compensation defined by the Compensation Intermediate Event attached to the boundary of the sub-process activities.

[[_escalation_end_event]]
.Escalation

The Escalation End Event finishes the incoming workflow, that means consumes the incoming token, and produces an escalation signal as defined in its properties, triggering the escalation process.

[[_terminate_end_event]]
.Terminate

The Terminate End Event finishes all execution flows in the given process instance. Activities being executed are canceled. If a Terminate End Event is reached in a sub-process, the entire process instance is terminated.
