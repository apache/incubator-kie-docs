= Installing and running {KIE_SERVER} with {WEBSPHERE}

After you have configured all required system properties in {WEBSPHERE}, you can install {KIE_SERVER} with {WEBSPHERE_SHORT} to streamline {PRODUCT} application management.

.Prerequisites
* An {WEBSPHERE} instance is configured as described in xref:was-configure-proc[].

.Procedure
. Navigate to the https://access.redhat.com/jbossnetwork/restricted/listSoftware.html[Software Downloads] page in the Red Hat Customer Portal (login required), and select the product and version from the drop-down options:
* *Product:* {PRODUCT_SHORT}
* *Version:* {PRODUCT_VERSION}
. Download *{PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION_LONG} {KIE_SERVER} for All Supported EE7 Containers*.
. Extract the
ifdef::PAM[]
`{PRODUCT_FILE}-kie-server-ee7.zip`
endif::PAM[]
ifdef::DM[]
`{PRODUCT_FILE}-kie-server-ee7.zip`
endif::DM[]
 archive to a temporary directory. In the following examples this directory is called `_TEMP_DIR_`.
. Repackage the `kie-server.war` directory:
.. Navigate to the `_TEMP_DIR_/{PRODUCT_FILE}-kie-server-ee7/kie-server.war` directory.
.. Select the contents of the  `_TEMP_DIR_/{PRODUCT_FILE}-kie-server-ee7/kie-server.war` directory and create the `kie-server.zip` file.
..  Rename `kie-server.zip` to `kie-server.war`. This is the file that you will use to deploy {KIE_SERVER}.
.. If desired, copy the new `kie-server.war` file to a location that is more convenient to deploy from.
