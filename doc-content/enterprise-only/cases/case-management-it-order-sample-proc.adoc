====
The business process application example includes features that are Technology Preview only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs), might not be functionally complete, and are not recommended for production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.
For more information about Red Hat Technology Preview support, see https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/[Technology Preview Features Support Scope].
