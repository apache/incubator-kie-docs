= Case modeler

Cases are designed using the Case definition process designer in {CENTRAL}. The case design is the basis of case management and sets the specific goals and tasks for each case. Case modeler allows non-technical users to view, modify and create data models for use in your processes. The following preview is based on the *IT_Orders* sample case management project in {CENTRAL}.

[NOTE]
====
The Case Modeler in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} is a Technology Preview feature and is disabled by default in {CENTRAL}. To enable the Case Modeler preview in {CENTRAL}, in the upper-right corner of the window, click *Settings* -> *Roles*, select a role from the left panel, click *Editors* -> *(New) Case Modeler* -> *Read*, and click *Save* to save the changes.

Both the case modeler preview and process designer models contain the *Place order* subtask.
