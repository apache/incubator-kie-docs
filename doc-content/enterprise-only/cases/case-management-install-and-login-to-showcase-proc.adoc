= Installing and logging in to the Showcase application

The Showcase application is included with the {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} distribution in the add-ons Zip file. The purpose of this application is to demonstrate the functionality of case management in {PRODUCT} and enable you to interact with cases created in {CENTRAL}. You can install the Showcase application in a {EAP_LONG} instance or on OpenShift. This procedure describes how to install the Showcase application in {EAP}.

.Prerequisites

* {CENTRAL} and {KIE_SERVER} are installed in an {EAP} instance.
* You have created a user with `kie-server` and `user` roles. Only users with the `user` role are able to log in to the Showcase application. Users also require the `kie-server` role to perform remote operations on the running {KIE_SERVER}.
* {CENTRAL} is not running.

.Procedure
. Navigate to the https://access.redhat.com/jbossnetwork/restricted/listSoftware.html[Software Downloads] page in the Red Hat Customer Portal (login required), and select the product and version from the drop-down options:

* Product: {PRODUCT}
* Version: {PRODUCT_VERSION}
. Download *{PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} Add Ons*

(`{PRODUCT_FILE}-add-ons.zip`).
endif::PAM[]
ifdef::DM[]
(`{PRODUCT_FILE}-add-ons.zip`).
endif::DM[]

. Extract the
ifdef::PAM[]
(`{PRODUCT_FILE}-add-ons.zip`).
endif::PAM[]
ifdef::DM[]
(`{PRODUCT_FILE}-add-ons.zip`).

file. The
ifdef::PAM[]

endif::PAM[]
ifdef::DM[]
(`rhdm-{PRODUCT_VERSION}-case-mgmt-showcase-eap7-deployable.zip`).
endif::DM[]
 file is in the unzipped directory.

. Extract the
ifdef::PAM[]
 (`rhpam-{PRODUCT_VERSION}-case-mgmt-showcase-eap7-deployable.zip`).
endif::PAM[]
ifdef::DM[]
 (`rhdm-{PRODUCT_VERSION}-case-mgmt-showcase-eap7-deployable.zip`).
endif::DM[]
 archive to a temporary directory. In the following examples this directory is called `__TEMP_DIR__`.
. Copy the contents of the
ifdef::PAM[]
`_TEMP_DIR/rhpam-{PRODUCT_VERSION}-case-mgmt-showcase-eap7-deployable/jboss-eap-{EAP_VERSION}`
endif::PAM[]
ifdef::DM[]
`_TEMP_DIR/rhdm-{PRODUCT_VERSION}-case-mgmt-showcase-eap7-deployable/jboss-eap-{EAP_VERSION}`
endif::DM[]
 directory to `__EAP_HOME__`.
+
When asked to overwrite files or merge directories, select *Yes*.
+
WARNING: Ensure the names of the {PRODUCT} deployments you copy do not conflict with your existing deployments in the {EAP} instance.

. Add the following system property to your deploymentâ€™s `{EAP_VERSION}/jboss-eap-{EAP_VERSION}/standalone/configuration/standalone-full.xml` file:
+
`<property name="org.jbpm.casemgmt.showcase.url" value="/rhpam-case-mgmt-showcase"/>`

. In a terminal application, navigate to *_EAP_HOME_/bin* and run the standalone configuration to start {CENTRAL}:
+
`./standalone.sh -c standalone-full.xml`
. In a web browser, enter
ifdef::PAM[]
`localhost:8080/{URL_COMPONENT_CENTRAL}`.
endif::[]
ifdef::DM[]
`localhost:8080/{URL_COMPONENT_CENTRAL}`.
endif::[]

+
If {PRODUCT} has been configured to run from a domain name, replace `localhost` with the domain name, for example:
+
ifdef::PAM[]
`http://www.example.com:8080/{URL_COMPONENT_CENTRAL}`
endif::[]
ifdef::DM[]
`http://www.example.com:8080/{URL_COMPONENT_CENTRAL}`
endif::[]

. In the upper-right corner in {CENTRAL}, click the *Apps launcher* button to launch the *Case Management Showcase* in a new browser window.
