= Adding ad hoc tasks

Ad hoc tasks are optional tasks that are configured in a case definition. Because they are ad hoc, they must be triggered in some way, usually by a signal event or Java API call.

.Prerequisite

* A case project has been created in {CENTRAL}.
* A case definition has been created.

.Procedure
. In the process designer, click image:cases/3898.png[right arrows] to open the *Object Library* on the left of the design palette.
. From the list, select a task that you want to add to the case definition as an ad hoc task.
+
For example, you might want to add a user task to fill out a warranty claim if goods that are received are faulty. A warranty claim may or may not need to be completed during the course of the case, but it is available to be performed in an ad hoc way if required.
. Configure the ad hoc task properties in the *Properties* panel on the right.
. Trigger the task during run time using a Java API call. For example, the  `Order rejected` ad hoc task is triggered by the following API call: `CaseService.triggerAdHocFragment`
