= Creating the Delivered to customer milestone
The condition for this milestone is that a case file variable named `delivered` is `true`. `Adhoc autostart` is not enabled for this milestone. Instead, it is triggered by a signal event after the order has successfully shipped to the customer.

.Procedure

. Click the new milestone and in the upper-right corner, click image:cases/left-arrows.png[] to open the *Properties* panel.

The IT Orders case can be closed after all milestone sequences are completed. However, due to the ad hoc nature of cases, the case could be reopened if, for example, the order was never received by the customer or the item is faulty. Tasks can be re-triggered or added to the case definition as required, even during run time.
