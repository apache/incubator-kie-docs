= Creating the Place order subprocess

Create the Place order subprocess, which is a separate business process that is carried out by the supplier. This is a reusable process that occurs during the course of case execution as described in <<case-management-designing-IT-hardware-proc>>.

.Prerequisites
* You have created a new case in {CENTRAL}. For more information, see <<case-management-creating-a-case-proc>>.
* You have created the data objects. For more information, see <<data-objects-con_{context}>>.

.Procedure
. In {CENTRAL}, go to *Menu* -> *Design* -> *Projects* -> *IT_Orders_New*.
. From the project menu, click *Add Asset* -> *Business Process*.
. In the *Create new Business Process* wizard, enter the following values:
* *Business Process*: `place-order`
* *Package*: Select `com.myspace.it_orders_new`
. Click *Ok*. The diagram editor opens.
. Click an empty space in the canvas, and in the upper-right corner, click the *Diagram properties* image:getting-started/diagram_properties.png[] icon.
. Scroll down and expand *Process Data* and click image:getting-started/btn_plus.png[] in the *Process Variables* section and enter the following values:
+
* *Name*: `CaseId`
* *Data Type*: `String`
.. Click image:getting-started/btn_plus.png[] to add a another variable:
+
* *Name*: `Requestor`
* *Data Type*: `String`
. Click the start event and create an outgoing connection from the start event to a task and convert the new task to a user task.

. Expand *Implementation/Execution*, click *Add* below the *Groups* menu, click *New*, and input `supplier`.
. Click image:getting-started/diagram_properties.png[] in the *Assignments* field and add the following new conditions in the *Place order Data I/O* window. For the first input assignment, select *Custom* for the *Data Type* and input `org.jbpm.document.Document`.

*<MH>Cristiano, the "caseFile_hwSpec" Source selection is not available from the pull-down. The same issue applies to both of the data output "Target" selections. I should also mention that I had to select "Custom" from the _hwSpec Data Type to enter "org.jbpm.document.Document". Are there steps missing in previous sections to rectify the missing options?</MH>*
