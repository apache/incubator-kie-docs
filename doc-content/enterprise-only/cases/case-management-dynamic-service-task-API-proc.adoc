= Creating a dynamic service task using the {KIE_SERVER} REST API

Service tasks are usually less complex than user tasks, although they might need more data to execute properly. Service tasks require the following information:

* `name`: The name of the activity
* `nodeType`: The type of node that will be used to find the work item handler
* `data`: The map of the data to properly deal with execution

During case run time, you can create a dynamic service task with the same endpoint as a user task, but with a different body payload.

Use the following procedure using the Swagger REST API to create a dynamic service task for the *IT_Orders* sample project available in {CENTRAL}. You can use the same endpoint for REST API without Swagger.

.Prerequisites
* You are logged in to {CENTRAL} and an IT Orders case instance has been started using the Showcase application. For more information about using Showcase, see {URL_DEVELOPING_PROCESS_SERVICES}#assembly-showcase-application[_{SHOWCASE_APPLICATION_CASE_MANAGEMENT}_].

.Procedure

. In a web browser, open the following URL:
+
`http://localhost:8080/kie-server/docs`
. Open the list of available endpoints under *Case instances :: Case Management*.
. Click the following `POST` method endpoint to open the details:
+
`/server/containers/{id}/cases/instances/{caseId}/stages/{caseStageId}/tasks`
+
. Click *Try it out* and then enter the following parameters:

 "name" : "InvokeService",
 "data" : {
   "Parameter" : "Fixed hardware spec",
   "Interface" : "org.jbpm.demo.itorders.services.ITOrderService",
   "Operation" : "printMessage",
   "ParameterType" : "java.lang.String"
  },
 "nodeType" : "Service Task"
}
----
. In the Swagger application, click *Execute* to create the dynamic task.


In this example, a Java-based service is executed. It consists of an interface with the public class `org.jbpm.demo.itorders.services.ITOrderService` and the public `printMessage` method with a single `String` argument. When executed, the parameter value is passed to the method for execution.

Numbers, names, and other types of data given to create service tasks depend on the implementation of a service task's handler. In the example provided, the `org.jbpm.process.workitem.bpmn2.ServiceTaskHandler` handler is used.

NOTE: For any custom service tasks, ensure the handler is registered in the deployment descriptor in the *Work Item Handlers* section, where the name is the same as the `nodeType` used for creating a dynamic service task. For more information about registering the deployment descriptor, see {URL_DEVELOPING_PROCESS_SERVICES}#registering-custom-tasks-proc-{context}[_{DEVELOPING_PROCESS_SERVICES}_].
