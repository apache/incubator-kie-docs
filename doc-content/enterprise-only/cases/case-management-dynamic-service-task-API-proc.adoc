= Creating a dynamic service task using the REST API

Service tasks are usually less complex than user tasks, although they might need more data to execute properly. Service tasks require the following information:

* `name`: The name of the activity
* `nodeType`: The type of node that will be used to find the work item handler
* `data`: The map of the data to properly deal with execution

During case run time, you can create a dynamic service task with the same endpoint as a user task, but with a different body payload.

Use the following procedure using the Swagger REST API to create a dynamic service task for the *IT_Orders* sample project available in {CENTRAL}. You can use the same endpoint for REST API without Swagger.

.Prerequisites
* You are logged in to {CENTRAL} and an IT Orders case instance has been started using the Showcase application. For more information about using Showcase, see {URL_SHOWCASE_APPLICATION_CASE_MANAGEMENT}[_{SHOWCASE_APPLICATION_CASE_MANAGEMENT}_].

.Procedure

. In a web browser, open the following URL:
+
`/http://localhost:8080/kie-server/docs`
. Open the list of available endpoints under *Case instances :: Case Management*.
. Click the following `POST` method endpoint to open the details:
+
`/server/containers/{id}/cases/instances/{caseId}/stages/{caseStageId}/tasks`
+
. Click *Try it out* and then enter the following parameters:

 "name" : "InvokeService",
 "data" : {
   "Parameter" : "Fixed hardware spec",
   "Interface" : "org.jbpm.demo.itorders.services.ITOrderService",
   "Operation" : "printMessage",
   "ParameterType" : "java.lang.String"
  },
 "nodeType" : "Service Task"
}
----
. In the Swagger application, click *Execute* to create the dynamic task.


In this example, a Java-based service is executed. It consists of an interface with the public class `org.jbpm.demo.itorders.services.ITOrderService` and the public `printMessage` method with a single `String` argument. When executed, the parameter value is passed to the method for execution.

Numbers, names, and other types of data given to create service tasks depend on the implementation of a service task's handler. In the example provided, the `org.jbpm.process.workitem.bpmn2.ServiceTaskHandler` handler is used.

NOTE: For any custom service tasks, ensure the handler is registered in the deployment descriptor in the *Work Item Handlers* section, where the name is the same as the `nodeType` used for creating a dynamic service task.
