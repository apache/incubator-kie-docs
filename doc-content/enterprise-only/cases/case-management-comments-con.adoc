= Comments

In case management, comments facilitate collaboration within the case instance, and allow case workers to easily communicate with each other to exchange information.

Comments are bound to the case instance. They are part of the case file, and therefore comments can be used to take action on them. Basic text-based comments can have a complete operations set, similar to CRUD (create, read, update, and delete).
