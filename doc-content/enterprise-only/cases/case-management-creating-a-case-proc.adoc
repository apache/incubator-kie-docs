= Creating a case

A case project is a type of project in {CENTRAL} that is configured for case management. When you create a new case project, the following configurations are set automatically in {CENTRAL}:

* Runtime strategy is set to `Per Case` in order to correctly initialize the {KIE_SERVER}.
* Case file and documents marshallers are configured. These marshallers serialize case file data and attached documents across the entire case. *<MH> Cristiano, should this read "A case file.." or possibly "Case files"?</MH>*
* Work item definition (`WorkDefinition.wid`) files that include the work items that are required for the case definition. The `WorkDefinition.wid` files are created in the project and its packages to ensure case-related nodes such as `Milestone` and `Cases` are available in the case definition design palette.

.Procedure
. Log in to {CENTRAL} and click *Menu* -> *Design* -> *Projects*.
. In the *MySpace* space in {CENTRAL}, click *Add Project* -> *Case project*.

+
The *Assets* view of the project opens.
. Confirm that the case project is set up correctly:
.. Click *Settings* -> *Deployments*.
.. Verify that the *Runtime Strategy* is set to `Per case` and that the *Marshalling Strategies* include the following case files:
+
* *org.jbpm.casemgmt.impl.marshalling.CaseMarshallerFactory.builder().withDoc().get();*
* *new org.jbpm.document.marshalling.DocumentMarshallingStrategy();*
+
.Verify case files
