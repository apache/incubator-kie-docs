= Creating a case

A case project is a type of project in {CENTRAL} that is configured for case management. When you create a new case project, the following configurations are set automatically in {CENTRAL}:

* Runtime strategy is set to `Per Case` in order to correctly initialize the {KIE_SERVER}. 
* Case file and documents marshallers are configured. These marshallers serialize case file data and attached documents across the entire case.
* `WorkDefinition.wid` files are created in the project and its packages to ensure case-related nodes such as `Milestone` and `Cases` are available in the case definition design palette.



.Procedure

. In the *MySpace* space in {CENTRAL}, click the down arrow next to the *Add Project* -> *Case project*.

. In the *Add Project* wizard, complete the required project information and click *Add*.

. To check that the case project has been set up correctly, click *Settings* -> *Deployments*. 
. Verify that the *Runtime Strategy* is set to `Per case` and that the *Marshalling Strategies* include a case file marshaller and a documents marshaller.
