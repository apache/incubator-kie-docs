= Modifying case role assignments during run time using Showcase

You can change case instance role assignments during case run time using the Showcase application. Roles are defined in the case definition and assigned to tasks in the case lifecycle. Roles cannot change during run time because they are predefined, but you can change the actors assigned to the roles to change who is responsible for carrying out case tasks.


.Prerequisite
There is an active case instance with users or groups already assigned to at least one case role.

.Procedure
. In the Showcase application, click the case you want to work on in the *Case list* to open the case overview.
. Locate the role assignment that you want to change in the *Roles* box in the lower-right corner of the page.
