=  Completing the *IT_Orders* case using Showcase and {CENTRAL}

When a case instance is started using the Showcase application, tasks that are configured as `Adhoc autostart` in the case definition are automatically assigned and made available to users with the role assignment for each task. Case workers can then work on the tasks in {CENTRAL} and complete them to move the case forward.

In the *IT_Orders* case project, the following case definition nodes are configured with the `Adhoc autostart` property:

* `Prepare hardware spec`
* `Hardware spec ready`
* `Manager decision`
* `Milestone 1: Order placed`

Of these, the only user task is `Prepare hardware spec`, which is assigned to the `supplier` group. This is the first human task to be completed in the IT Orders case. When this task is complete, the `Manager approval` task becomes available to the user assigned to the `manager` role, and after the rest of the case work is finished, the `Customer satisfaction survey` task is assigned to the case owner for completion.
