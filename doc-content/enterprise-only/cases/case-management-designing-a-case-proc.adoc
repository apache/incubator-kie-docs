= Designing the Order for IT hardware case

Cases are designed using the process designer in {CENTRAL}. Case design is the basis of case management and sets the specific goals and tasks for each case. The case flow can be modified dynamically during run time by adding dynamic tasks or processes.

The IT Orders sample project in {CENTRAL} includes the following *orderhardware* business process case definition. In this chapter, you will create this same case definition to familiarize yourself with the case definition design process.

.orderhardware business process case definition
image::cases/itorders-orderhardware-process.png[IT Orders case design]

.Prerequisite
* You have created a new case in {CENTRAL}. For more information, see <<case-management-creating-a-case-proc>>.
* You have created the data objects. For more information, see <<data-objects-con_{context}>>.
* You have created the Place order subprocess. For more information, see <<case-management-creating-subproc-proc>>.

.Procedure
. In {CENTRAL}, go to *Menu* -> *Design* -> *Projects* and click *IT_Orders_New*.
. Click *Add Asset* -> *Case Definition (legacy)*.
. In the *Create new Case definition* window, add the following required information:
+
* *Case Definition*: Input `orderhardware`. This is usually the subject of the case or project that is being case managed.
* *Package*: Select *com.myspace.it_orders_new* to specify the location that the case file is created in.
//* `Case ID prefix (optional)`: A configurable prefix that enables you to easily distinguish different types of cases. The prefix is followed by a generated ID in the format `ID-XXXXXXXXXX`, where `XXXXXXXXXX` is a generated number that provides a unique ID for the case instance. If a prefix is not provided, the default prefix is `CASE` and generates instances with the following identifiers:
//+
//`CASE-0000000001`
//+
//`CASE-0000000002`
//+
//`CASE-0000000003`
//+
//If a prefix is set to something else, such as `IT` for example, the following identifiers are generated:
//+
//`IT-0000000001`
//+
//`IT-0000000002`
//+
//`IT-0000000003`

image::cases/case_roles-2.png[Case Roles]

+
* `owner`: The employee who is making the hardware order request. The role cardinality is set to `1`, which means that only one person or group can be assigned to this role.
* `manager`: The employee's manager; the person who will approve or deny the requested hardware. The role cardinality is set to `1`, which means that only one person or group can be assigned to this role.
* `supplier`: The available suppliers of IT hardware in the system. The role cardinality is set to `2`, which means that more than one supplier can be assigned to this role.

The IT Orders case can be closed after all milestone sequences are completed. However, due to the ad hoc nature of cases, the case could be reopened if, for example, the order was never received by the customer or the item is faulty. Tasks can be re-triggered or added to the case definition as required, even during run time.
