= Starting the Order for IT Hardware case

In the Showcase application, start a new case instance for the *IT_Orders* sample case management project in the Showcase application.

The *IT_Orders* sample case management project includes the following roles:

* `owner`: The employee who is making the hardware order request. The role cardinality is set to `1`, which means that only one person or group can be assigned to this role.
* `manager`: The employee's manager; the person who will approve or deny the requested hardware. The role cardinality is set to `1`, which means that only one person or group can be assigned to this role.
* `supplier`: The available suppliers of IT hardware in the system. The role cardinality is set to `2`, which means that more than one supplier can be assigned to this role.

.Prerequisites
