= Starting dynamic tasks and processes

You can add dynamic tasks and processes to a case during run time. Dynamic actions are a way to address changing situations, where an unanticipated change during the case requires a new task or process to be incorporated into the case.

Use a case application to add a dynamic task during run time. For demonstration purposes, the {CENTRAL} distribution includes a Showcase application where you can start a new dynamic task or process for the IT Orders application.

.Prerequisites

* {KIE_SERVER} is deployed and connected to {CENTRAL}.
* The IT Orders project is deployed to {KIE_SERVER}.
* The Showcase application `.war` file has been deployed alongside {CENTRAL}.

.Procedure
. With the *IT_Orders_New* project deployed and running in {KIE_SERVER}, in a web browser, navigate to the Showcase login page `http://localhost:8080/rhpam-case-mgmt-showcase/`.
+
Alternatively, if you have configured {CENTRAL} to display the *Apps launcher* button, use it to open a new browser window with the Showcase login page.
