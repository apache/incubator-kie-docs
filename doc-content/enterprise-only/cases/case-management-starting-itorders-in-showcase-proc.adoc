= Starting an IT Orders case in the Showcase application

You can start a new case instance for the IT Orders sample case management project in the Showcase application.

The IT Orders sample case management project includes the following roles:

* `owner` - the employee who is making the hardware order request. There can be only one of these roles.
* `manager` - the employee's manager; the person who will approve or deny the requested hardware. There is only one manager in the IT Orders project.
* `supplier` - the available suppliers of IT hardware in the system. There is usually more than one supplier.

These roles are configured at the case definition level:
