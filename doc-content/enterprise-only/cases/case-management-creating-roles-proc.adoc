= Creating case roles

You can create and define case roles in the case definition when you design the case in the process designer. Case roles are configured on the case definition level to keep them separate from the actors involved in handling the case instance. Roles can be assigned to user tasks or used as contact references throughout the case lifecycle, but they are not defined in the case as a specific user or group of users.

Case instances include the individuals that are actually handling the case work. Assign roles when starting a new case instance. In order to keep cases flexible, you can modify case role assignment during case run time, although doing this has no effect on tasks already created based on the previous role assignment. The actor assigned to a role is flexible but the role itself remains the same for each case.

.Prerequisites
* A case project that has a case definition exists in {CENTRAL}.
* The case definition asset is open in the process designer.

.Procedure
. To define the roles involved in the case, click image:cases/3897.png[] to open the *Properties* menu on the right side of the designer and open the *Editor for Case Roles*.
. Click *Add Case Role* to add a case role.

The case role requires a name for the role and a case cardinality. Case cardinality is the number of actors that are assigned to the role in any case instance. For example, the *IT_Orders* sample case management project includes the following roles:

In this example, you can assign only one actor (a user or a group) as the case `owner` and assign only one actor to the `manager` role. The `supplier` role can have two actors assigned. Depending on the case, you can assign any number of actors to a particular role based on the configured case cardinality of the role.
