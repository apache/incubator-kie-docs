= Defining a stage

A stage can be modeled in BPMN2 using the process designer. Stages are a way of grouping related tasks in a way that clearly defines activities that, if the stage is activated, must complete before the next stage of the case commences. For example, the *IT_Orders* case definition can also be defined using stages in the following way:

.Procedure
. From the predefined node panel located on the left side of the diagram editor, drag and drop an *Ad-Hoc* node onto the design canvas and provide a name for the stage node.
. Define how the stage is activated:
+
* If the stage is being activated by an incoming node, connect the stage with a sequence flow line from the incoming node.
* If the stage is instead being activated by a signal event, configure the `SignalRef` on the signal node with the name of the stage that you configured in the first step.
* Alternatively, configure the `AdHocActivationCondition` property to activate the stage when the condition has been met.

. Re-size the node as required to provide room to add the task nodes for the stage.
. Add the relevant tasks to the stage and configure them as required.
. (Optional) Configure a completion condition for the stage. As an ad hoc subprocess, stages are configured as `autocomplete` by default, which means that the stage will automatically complete and trigger the next activity in the case definition once all instances in the stage are no longer active.
+
To change the completion condition, select the stage node and open the *Properties* panel on the right, expand *Implementation/Execution*, and modify the `AdHocCompletionCondition` property field with a free-form Drools expression for the completion condition you require. For more information about stage completion conditions, see <<case-management-stage-activation-and-completion-conditions-proc>>.
. Once the stage has been configured, connect it to the next activity in the case definition using a sequence flow line.
