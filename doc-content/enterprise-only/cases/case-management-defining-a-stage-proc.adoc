= Defining a stage

A stage can be modeled in BPMN2 using the process designer. Stages are a way of grouping related tasks in a way that clearly defines activities that, if the stage is activated, must complete before the next stage of the case commences. For example, the IT Orders case definition described in <<case-management-designing-a-case-proc>> can also be defined using stages in the following way:

.Prerequisites

* You have followed the procedure in <<case-management-creating-a-case-proc>> to create a new case in {CENTRAL}.
* You have started a case definition and defined any other required case nodes described in <<case-management-designing-a-case-proc>>. Stages must be triggered by another node within a case definition, so at least one other node must be configured in the designer before the stage can be started.  

.Procedure
. From the process designer, click image:cases/3897.png[] on the left of the palette to open the *Object Library*. Open the  *Subprocesses* object list, drag and drop an *Ad-Hoc* node onto the design canvas and provide a name for the stage node.
. Define how the stage is activated: 
+ 
* If the stage is being activated by an incoming node, connect the stage with a sequence flow line from the incoming node.
* If the stage is instead being activated by a signal event, configure the `SignalRef` on the signal node with the name of the stage that you configured in the first step. 
* Alternatively, configure the `AdHocActivationCondition` property to activate the stage when the condition has been met.

. Re-size the node as required to provide room to add the task nodes for the stage. 
. Add the relevant tasks to the stage and configure them as required.
. (Optional) Configure a completion condition for the stage. As an ad hoc subprocess, stages are configured as `autocomplete` by default, which means that the stage will automatically complete and trigger the next activity in the case definition once all instances in the stage are no longer active. 
+
To change the completion condition, select the stage node and open the *Properties* panel on the right. Modify the `AdhocCompletionCondition` property field in the with a free-form Drools expression for the completion condition you require. For more information about stage completion conditions, see <<case-management-stage-activation-and-completion-conditions-proc>>.
. Once the stage has been configured, connect it to the next activity in the case definition using a sequence flow line.
