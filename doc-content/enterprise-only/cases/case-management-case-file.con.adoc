= Case file

A case instance is a single instance of a case definition and should encapsulate the given business context. All case instance data is stored in the case file, which is accessible to all process instances that might participate in the given case instance. Each case instance and its case file is completely isolated from the other cases. Only case instance participants can access the case file.

A case file is used in case management as a repository of data for the entire case instance. It contains all roles, the object itself, the data map, and any other data. The case can be closed and reopened at a later date with the same case file attached. A case instance can be closed at any time and does not require a specific resolution in order to be “completed”.

IMPORTANT: The case file can also include documentation in the form of embedded documentation, references, PDF attachments, web links, and so on.
