= Using rules to drive cases

Refer to the the case management *IT_Orders* sample project in {CENTRAL}.

Suppose that the particular hardware specification provided by the supplier is incorrect or invalid. The supplier needs to provide a new, valid order so that the case can continue. Rather than wait for the manager to reject the invalid specification and create a new request for the supplier, you can create a business rule that will react immediately when the case data indicates that the provided specification is invalid. It can then create a new hardware specification request for the supplier.

The following procedure demonstrates how to create and use a business rule to execute the described scenario.


.Prerequisites
* The *IT_Orders* sample project is open in {CENTRAL}, but it is not deployed to the {KIE_SERVER}.
* The `ServiceRegistry` is part of the `jbpm-services-api` module, and must be available on the class path.
+
[NOTE]
====
If building the project outside of {CENTRAL}, the following dependencies must be added to the project:

* `org.jbpm:jbpm-services-api`
* `org.jbpm:jbpm-case-mgmt-api`
====


.Procedure
. Create the following business rule file called `validate-document.drl`:
+
[source,java]
----
package defaultPackage;

import java.util.Map;
import java.util.HashMap;
import org.jbpm.casemgmt.api.CaseService;
import org.jbpm.casemgmt.api.model.instance.CaseFileInstance;
import org.jbpm.document.Document;
import org.jbpm.services.api.service.ServiceRegistry;

rule "Invalid document name - reupload"
when
    $caseData : CaseFileInstance()
    Document(name == "invalid.pdf") from $caseData.getData("hwSpec")

then

    System.out.println("Hardware specification is invalid");
    $caseData.remove("hwSpec");
    update($caseData);
    CaseService caseService = (CaseService) ServiceRegistry.get().service(ServiceRegistry.CASE_SERVICE);
    caseService.triggerAdHocFragment($caseData.getCaseId(), "Prepare hardware spec", null);
end
----
+
This business rule detects when a file named `invalid.pdf` is uploaded to the case file. It then removes the `invalid.pdf` document and creates a new instance of the `Prepare hardware spec` user task.
. Click *Build*, then click *Deploy* to deploy the *IT_Orders* project.
. Create a file called `invalid.pdf` and save it locally.
. Create a file called `valid-spec.pdf`and save it locally.
. In {CENTRAL}, go to *Menu* -> *Projects* -> *IT_Orders* to open the *IT_Orders* project.
. Click *Import Asset* in the upper-right corner of the page.
. Upload the `validate-document.drl` file to the `default` package (`src/main/resources`).
+

+
The `validate-document.drl` rule is shown in the rule editor. Click *Save* or close to exit the rule editor.

. Open the Showcase application by either clicking the *Apps launcher* (if it is installed), or go to `http://localhost:8080/rhpam-case-mgmt-showcase/jbpm-cm.html`.
. Start a new case for the *IT_Orders* project.
+
In this example, Aimee is the case `owner`, Katy is the `manager`, and the supplier group is `supplier`.
+

. Log out of {CENTRAL}, and log back in as a user that belongs to the `supplier` group.
. Go to *Menu* -> *Track* -> *Task Inbox*.
. Open the `Prepare hardware spec` task and click *Claim*. This assigns the task to the logged in user.
. Click *Start* and click image:cases/choose-file-button.png[choose file] to locate the `invalid.pdf` hardware specification file. Click image:cases/upload-button.png[the upload button] to upload the file.
+

+
Click *Complete*.
+
The value in the *Task Inbox* for the `Prepare hardware spec` is `Ready`.
. In Showcase, click *Refresh* in the upper-right corner. Notice that a `Prepare hardware task` message appears in the *Completed* column and another appears in the *In Progress* column.
+
image::cases/case-management-new-spec-task.png[]
+
This is because the first `Prepare hardware spec` task has been completed with the specification file `invalid.pdf`. As a result, the business rule causes the task and file to be discarded, and a new user task created.
. In the {CENTRAL} *Task Inbox*, repeat steps 12 and 13, but upload the `valid-spec.pdf` file instead of `invalid.pdf`.
. Log out of {CENTRAL} and log back in again as `Katy`.
. Go to *Menu* -> *Track* -> *Task Inbox*. There are two `Manager approval` tasks for Katy, one with the `invalid.pdf` hardware specification file, the other with the `valid-spec.pdf` file.
. Open, claim, and complete each task:
.. Check the `approve` box for the task that includes the `valid-spec.pdf` file, then click *Complete*.
.. Do not check the `approve` box on the task with the `invalid.pdf` file, then click *Complete*.
. Go to *Menu* -> *Manage* -> *Process Instances* and open the *Order for IT hardware* process instance.
. Open the *Diagram* tab. The `Order rejected` and `Place order` processes are now marked as *Completed*.

Similarly, the case details page in Showcase lists two `Manager approval` tasks in the *Completed* column.
