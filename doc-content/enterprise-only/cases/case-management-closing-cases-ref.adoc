= Closing cases

A case instance can be completed when there are no more activities to be performed and the business goal is achieved, or it can be closed prematurely. Usually the case owner closes the case when all work is completed and the case goals have been met.
When you close a case, consider adding a comment about why the case instance is being closed.

A closed case can be reopened later with the same case ID if required. When a case is reopened, stages that were active when the case was closed will be active when the case is reopened.

You can close case instances remotely using {KIE_SERVER} REST API requests or directly in the Showcase application.
