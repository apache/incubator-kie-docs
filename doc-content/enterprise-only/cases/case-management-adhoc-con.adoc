= Ad hoc and dynamic tasks

You can use case management to carry out tasks in an ad hoc way, rather than following a strict end-to-end process. Tasks can also be added to a case dynamically during run time when required.

Ad hoc tasks are defined in the case modeling phase. Ad hoc tasks that are not configured as `Adhoc autostart` are optional and might not be used during a case. Therefore, they must be triggered by a signal event or by Java API to be available to be worked on during a case.

Dynamic tasks are defined during the case execution and are not present in the case definition model. Dynamic tasks address specific needs that arise during the case. They can be added to the case and worked on at any time using a case application, as demonstrated in the {PRODUCT} Showcase application. Dynamic tasks can also be added by Java and Remote API calls.

Dynamic tasks can be user or service activities, while ad hoc tasks can be any type of task.

Dynamic processes are any reusable sub-process from a case project.

Ad hoc nodes with no incoming connections are configured in the node's `Adhoc autostart` property and are triggered automatically when the case instance is started.

Ad hoc tasks are optional tasks that are configured in a case definition. Because they are ad hoc, they must be triggered in some way, usually by a signal event or Java API call.
