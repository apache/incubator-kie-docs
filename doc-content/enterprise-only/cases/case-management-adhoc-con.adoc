= Ad hoc and dynamic tasks

You can use case management to carry out tasks in an ad hoc way, rather than following a strict end-to-end process. Tasks can also be added to a case dynamically during run time when required.

Ad hoc tasks are defined in the case modeling phase. Ad hoc tasks that are not configured as `Adhoc autostart` are optional and may or may not be worked on during a case. Therefore, they must be triggered by a signal event or by Java API to be available to be worked on during a case.

Dynamic tasks are defined during the case execution and are not present in the case definition model. Dynamic tasks address specific needs that arise during the case. You can use a case application to add dynamic tasks to the case to be worked on, as demonstrated in the {PRODUCT} Showcase application. Dynamic tasks can also be added by Java and Remote API calls.

Dynamic tasks can be user or service activities, while ad hoc tasks can be any type of task.

Dynamic processes are any reusable subprocess from a case project.

Ad hoc nodes with no incoming connections can be configured with the `Adhoc autostart` property, which is a property of the node itself. These tasks are triggered automatically when the case instance is started.
