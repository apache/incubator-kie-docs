= Case Management Model and Notation

You can use {CENTRAL} to import, view, and modify the content of Case Management Model and Notation (CMMN) files. When authoring a project, you can import your case management model and then select it from the asset list to view or modify it in a standard XML editor.

The following CMMN constructs are currently available:

* Tasks (human task, process task, decision task, case task)
* Discretionary tasks (same as above)
* Stages
* Milestones
* Case file items
* Sentries (entry and exit)

The following tasks are not supported:

* Required
* Repeat
* Manual activation

Sentries for individual tasks are limited to entry criteria while entry and exit criteria are supported for stages and milestones. Decision tasks map by default to a DMN decision. Event listeners are not supported.

{PRODUCT} does not provide any modeling capabilities for CMMN and focuses solely on the execution of the model.
