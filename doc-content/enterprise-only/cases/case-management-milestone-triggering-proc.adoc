Case milestones can be configured to start automatically when a case instance starts or they can triggered using a signal, which is configured manually during the case design.

.Prerequisites

* A case project has been created in {CENTRAL}.
* A case definition has been created.

.Procedure
. From the predefined node panel located on the left side of the diagram editor, drag and drop a `Milestone` object onto the palette.

+

. With the milestone selected, click image:getting-started/diagram_properties.png[] to open the *Properties* panel on the right side of the designer.
. Expand *Data Assignments* to add a completion condition. Milestones include a `condition` parameter by default.
. To define the completion condition for the milestone, select `Constant` from the `Source` list. The condition must be provided using the Drools syntax.
. Expand *Implementation/Execution* to configure the `Adhoc Autostart` property.
+
* Click the check box to set this property to `true` for milestones that are required to start automatically when a case instance starts.
+
* Leave the check box empty to set this property to `false` for milestones that are to be triggered by a signal event.
. *(Optional)* Configure a signal event to trigger a milestone once a case goal has been reached.
.. With the signal event selected in the case design palette, open the *Properties* panel on the right.
.. Set the `Signal Scope` property to `Process Instance`.
.. Open the `SignalRef` expression editor and type the name of the milestone to be triggered.
