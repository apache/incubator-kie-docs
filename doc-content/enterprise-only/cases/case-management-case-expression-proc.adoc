= Configuring case ID expressions

The following procedures uses the *IT_Orders* sample project to demonstrate how set metadata attribute keys to customize expressions for generating the `caseId`.

.Prerequisites
* The *IT_Orders* sample project is open in {CENTRAL}.

.Procedure
. In {CENTRAL}, go to *Menu* -> *Design* -> *Projects*. If there are existing projects, you can access the samples by clicking the *MySpace* default space and selecting *Try Samples* from the *Add Project* drop-down menu. If there are no existing projects, click *Try samples*.
. Select *IT_Orders* and click *Ok*.
. In the *Assets* window, click the *orderhardware* business process to open the designer.
. Click on an empty space on the canvas and in the upper-right corner, click the *Properties* image:getting-started/diagram_properties.png[] icon.
. Expand the *Advanced* menu to access the *Metadata Attributes* fields.
. Specify one of the following functions for the `customCaseIdPrefix` metadata attribute:
+
--
* *LPAD*: Left padding
* *RPAD*: Right padding
* *TRUNCATE*: Truncate
* *UPPER*: Upper case

In this example, `type` is a variable set in the *Case File Variables* field, which during runtime a user may define to it the value `type1`. `UPPER` is a pre-built function to uppercase a variable, and `IT-` is a static prefix. The results are dynamic case IDs such as `IT-TYPE1-0000000001`, `IT-TYPE1-0000000002`, and `IT-TYPE1-0000000003`.

If the `customCaseIdPrefixIsSequence` case metadata attribute is set to `false` (default value is `true`), the case instance will not create any sequence and the `caseIdPrefix` expression is the case ID. For example, if generating case IDs based on social security numbers, no specific sequence or instance identifiers are required.

The `customCaseIdPrefixIsSequence` metadata attribute is optionally added and set to `false` (default value is `true`) to disable the numeric sequences for the case IDs. This is useful if an expression used for custom case IDs already contains a case file variable to express unique business identifiers instead of the generic sequence values. For example, if generating case IDs based on social security numbers, no specific sequence or instance identifiers are required. For the example below, `SOCIAL_SECURITY_NUMBER` is also a variable declared as a case file variable.

The `IS_PREFIX_SEQUENCE` case file variable is optionally added as a flag during runtime to disable or enable the sequence generation for case IDs. For example, there is no need to create a sequence suffix for medical insurance coverage for an individual. For a multi-family insurance policy, the company might set the `IS_PREFIX_SEQUENCE` case variable to `true` to aggregate a sequence number for each member of the family.

The result of using the `customCaseIdPrefixIsSequence` metadata attribute statically as `false` or using the `IS_PREFIX_SEQUENCE` case file variable and setting during runtime for it the value `false`, is the same.
