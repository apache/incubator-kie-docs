= Canceling a case in the Showcase application

You can cancel a case before it is complete if for some reason work is no longer required for it. If needed, you can reopen the case later with the same case ID. You can also permanently destroy a case so that it cannot be reopened.

.Prerequisites
* A case instance has been started using Showcase.
//* You are able to authenticate API requests as a user with the `admin` role.

.Procedure
. In the Showcase application, locate the case instance you want to cancel from the list of case instances.
. To cancel the case without viewing the details first, click (image:cases/dotdotdotbutton.png[]) in the upper-right corner of the page and click *Cancel*.
. To cancel the case from the case details page, click the case in the list to open it.
+
From the case overview page you can add comments to the case and verify that you are canceling the correct case based on the case information.
. Click the three dots (image:cases/dotdotdotbutton.png[]) in the upper-right corner of the page and click *Cancel*.
. Click *Back to Case List* in the upper-left corner of the page to return to the Showcase case list view.
. Click the drop-down list next to *Status* and select *Canceled* to view the list of closed and canceled cases. If the case has been destroyed, it will no longer appear in any case list.
