= Configuring stage activation and completion conditions

*<MH>Cristiano, This section seems random to me. Can I remove it for the sake of the tutorial? If it applies to the showcase app, I can add it to another topic.</MH>*

Stages can be triggered by a start node, intermediate node, or manually using an API call.

You can configure stages with both activation and completion conditions using free-form Drools rules, the same way that milestone completion conditions are configured. For example, in the IT Orders sample project, the `Milestone 2: Order shipped` completion condition (`org.kie.api.runtime.process.CaseData(data.get("shipped") == true)`) can also be used as the completion condition for the `Order delivery` stage represented here:

Activation conditions can also be configured using a free-form Drools rule to configure the `AdHocActivationCondition` property to activate a stage.

.Prerequisite
* You have created a case definition in the {CENTRAL} process designer.
* You have added an ad hoc subprocess to the case definition that is to be used as a stage.

.Procedure
. With the stage selected on the case design canvas, click image:cases/3898.png[] to open the *Properties* panel on the right.
. Open the `AdHocActivationCondition` property editor to define an activation condition for the start node. For example, `autostart: true` to make the stage automatically activated when a new case instance is started.
. The `AdHocCompletionCondition` is set to `autocomplete` by default. To change this, open the property editor to define a completion condition using a free-form Drools expression. For example, `org.kie.api.runtime.process.CaseData(data.get("ordered") == true)` to activate the second stage in the example shown previously.
