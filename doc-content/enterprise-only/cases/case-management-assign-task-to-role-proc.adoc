= Assigning a task to a role

Case management processes need to be as flexible as possible to accommodate changes that can happen dynamically during run time. This includes changing user assignments for new case instances or for active cases. For this reason, ensure that you do not hard code roles to a single set of users or groups in the case definition. Instead, role assignments can be defined on the task nodes in the case definition, with users or groups assigned to the roles on case creation.

{PRODUCT} contains a predefined selection of node types to simplify business process creation. The predefined node panel is located on the left side of the diagram editor.

.Prerequisites
* A case definition has been created with case roles configured at the case definition level. For more information about creating case roles, see xref:case-management-creating-roles-proc-case-management-design[Creating case roles].

.Procedure
. Open the *Activities* menu in the designer palette and drag the user or service task that you want to add to your case definition onto the process designer canvas.
. With the task node selected, click image:getting-started/diagram_properties.png[the Properties icon] to open the *Properties* panel on the right side of the designer.
. Expand *Implementation/Execution*, click *Add* below the *Actors* property and either select or type the name of the role to which the task will be assigned. You can use the *Groups* property in the same way for group assignments.

For example, in the *IT_Orders* sample project, the `Manager approval` user task is assigned to the `manager` role:

In this example, after the `Prepare hardware spec` user task has been completed, the user assigned to the `manager` role will receive the `Manager approval` task in their *Task Inbox* in {CENTRAL}.

The user assigned to the role can be changed during the case run time, but the task itself continues to have the same role assignment. For example, the person originally assigned to the `manager` role might need to take time off (if they become ill, for example), or they might unexpectedly leave the company. To respond to this change in circumstances, you can edit the `manager` role assignment so that someone else can be assigned the tasks associated with that role.
