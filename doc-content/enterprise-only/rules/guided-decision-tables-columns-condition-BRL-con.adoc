= "Add a Condition BRL fragment"

A Business Rule Language (BRL) fragment is a section of a rule created using the guided rules designer. The condition BRL fragment is the "WHEN" portion of the rule, and the xref:guided-decision-tables-columns-action-BRL-con[action BRL fragment] is the "THEN" portion of the rule. With this column option, you can define a condition BRL fragment to be used in the left ("WHEN") side of a rule. Simpler column types can refer to Facts and Fact fields bound in the BRL fragment and vice-versa.

Example condition BRL fragment for a loan application:

You can also select *Free form DRL* from the list of condition options to define the condition BRL fragment without the embedded guided rules designer.

.Template keys
[NOTE]
====
When you add a field for a condition BRL fragment, one of the value options is *Template key* (as opposed to *Literal* or *Formula*). Template keys are placeholder variables that are interchanged with a specified value when the guided decision table is generated, and form separate columns in the table for each template key value specified. While Literal and Formula values are static in a decision table, Template key values can be modified as needed.

In the embedded guided rules designer, you can add a template key value to a field by selecting the *Template key* field option and entering the value in the editor in the format `$key`. For example, `$age` creates an `$age` column in the decision table.

In free form DRL, you can add a template key value to facts in the format `@{key}`. For example, `Person( age > @{age} )` creates an `$age` column in the decision table.

The data type is String for new columns added using template keys.
