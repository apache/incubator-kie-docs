== Open Network Automation Platform

Open Network Automation Platform (ONAP) provides orchestration and automation capabilities for physical as well as virtual network functions. It reduces the cost and time needed to implement new service offerings by exploiting new paradigms of software defined networking as well as network function virtualization. ONAP provides the following capabilities:

* Builds service by modeling resources and their relationships.
* Automates the instantiation of services based on policies.
* Monitors the services using an analytics framework.
* Automates the life cycle management actions on services and underlying resources based on events and policies.

== Policy

You can define a policy as a condition, requirement, constraint, decision or a need that must be provided, evaluated, maintained, and enforced. A policy can also be defined at a lower or functional level, such as a machine-readable rule or software condition or assertion which enables actions to be taken based on a trigger or request, specific to particular selected conditions in effect at that time.

The following table lists the policies that affect networking.
