= Automation and Ansible

Ansible is a radically simple automation engine that automates link:https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks[network functions], link:https://www.ansible.com/provisioning?hsLang=en-us[cloud provisioning], link:https://www.ansible.com/configuration-management?hsLang=en-us[configuration management], link:https://www.ansible.com/application-deployment?hsLang=en-us[application deployment], link:https://www.ansible.com/orchestration?hsLang=en-us[intra-service orchestration], and many other automation needs.

Designed for multi-tier deployments, Ansible models your environment by describing how all of your systems interrelate, rather than just managing one system at a time.

It uses no agents and no additional custom security infrastructure, so it's easy to deploy - and most importantly, it uses a very simple language (YAML, in the form of Ansible Playbooks) that allow you to describe your automation jobs in a way that approaches plain English.

Ansible engine has two additional optional components:

* *Ansible Tower*: Red Hat(R) Ansible(R) Tower helps you scale IT automation, manage complex deployments and speed productivity. Centralize and control your IT infrastructure with a visual dashboard, role-based access control, job scheduling, integrated notifications and graphical inventory management. And Ansible Tower REST API and CLI make it easy to embed Ansible Tower into existing tools and processes.
* *Ansible Networking Add-on*: If you leverage Ansible Engine as part of your automation strategy, the Networking Add-on provides additional support for select network modules that are developed, tested, and released in-house for the most popular networking platforms. Network modules allow operators and engineers peace of mind, especially in mixed network environments that have differing needs and implementations.
