= Rules Engines and {PRODUCT}

A rules engine is a software element that makes decisions on the basis of business logic built using declarative format. Rules engine can be very basic providing support for simple rules to very complicated based on sophisticated algorithms.

{PRODUCT} provides a versatile set of decision capabilities, including a rules engine based on the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_bpm_suite/6.4/html-single/development_guide/#phreak_algorithm[PHREAK] algorithm (an evolution of the well know Rete algorithm), a link:https://www.omg.org/spec/DMN/About-DMN/[DMN v1.1 FEEL Compliance Level 3] runtime, support for link:https://www.packtpub.com/mapt/book/networking_and_servers/9781783288625/7/ch07lvl1sec47/pmml[PMML], as well as a Complex Event Processing engine.

The PHREAK reasoning algorithm provides a runtime that easily scales to hundreds of thousands of rules in a single rules execution environment, while providing low-latency and high-performance business rules execution.

Being a lightweight engine, you can use {PRODUCT} as a decision service and runtime in various architectures and deployment topologies, including, but not limited to, embedded systems and microservices architectures. You can combine the decision engine with multiple application frameworks and runtimes.

{PRODUCT} is built on open standards (DMN, XML, JSON, JAX-RS) and de-facto standards (Git, Maven, Eclipse, IntelliJ). It has the following capabilities:

* Automates decision making.
* Incorporates sophisticated decision logic easily.
* Separates decision logic from program code and defines it in simple, declarative, business-friendly terms, making it more easier and efficient to implement, manage, audit, and change.
* Provides business expert friendly and developer friendly UI to collaborate effectively to build policies.

All these results in improved business agility, consistent and efficient decision execution, shorter development cycles, and faster time to market.
