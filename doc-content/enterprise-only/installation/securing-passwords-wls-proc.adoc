= Securing passwords with a keystore

You can use a keystore to encrypt passwords that are used for communication between {CENTRAL} and {KIE_SERVER}. You should encrypt both controller and {KIE_SERVER} passwords. If {CENTRAL} and {KIE_SERVER} are deployed to different application servers, then both application servers should use the keystore.

Use Java Cryptography Extension KeyStore (JCEKS) for your keystore because it supports symmetric keys. Use KeyTool, which is part of the JDK installation, to create a new JCEKS.

[NOTE]
====
If {KIE_SERVER} is not configured with JCEKS, {KIE_SERVER} passwords are stored in system properties in plain text form.
====

.Prerequisites

* {KIE_SERVER} is installed in {WEBLOGIC}.
* A {KIE_SERVER} user with the `kie-server` role has been created, as described in xref:wls-users-set-proc[].
* Java 8 or higher is installed.

.Procedure

. To use KeyTool to create a JCEKS, enter the following command in the Java 8 home directory:
+
[source,bash]
----
$<JAVA_HOME>/bin/keytool -importpassword -keystore <KEYSTORE_PATH> -keypass <ALIAS_KEY_PASSWORD> -alias <PASSWORD_ALIAS> -storepass <KEYSTORE_PASSWORD> -storetype JCEKS
----
+
In this example, replace the following variables:

* `<KEYSTORE_PATH>`: The path where the keystore will be stored
* `<KEYSTORE_PASSWORD>`: The keystore password
* `<ALIAS_KEY_PASSWORD>`: The password used to access values stored with the alias
* `<PASSWORD_ALIAS>`: The alias of the entry to the process

. When prompted, enter the password for the {KIE_SERVER} user that you created.

. Set the system properties listed in the following table:

|===
| System property
| Placeholder
| Description

| `kie.keystore.keyStoreURL`
| `<KEYSTORE_URL>`
| URL for the JCEKS that you want to use, for example `\file:///home/kie/keystores/keystore.jceks`

| `kie.keystore.keyStorePwd`
| `<KEYSTORE_PWD>`
| Password for the JCEKS

| `kie.keystore.key.server.alias`
| `<KEY_SERVER_ALIAS>`
| Alias of the key for REST services where the password is stored

| `kie.keystore.key.server.pwd`
| `<KEY_SERVER_PWD>`
| Password of the alias for REST services with the stored password

| `kie.keystore.key.ctrl.alias`
| `<KEY_CONTROL_ALIAS>`
| Alias of the key for default REST Process Automation Controller where the password is stored

| `kie.keystore.key.ctrl.key.ctrl.pwd`
| `<KEY_CONTROL_PWD>`
| Password of the alias for default REST  Process Automation Controller with the stored password

|===

. Start {KIE_SERVER} to verify the configuration.
