= Thread efficiency

To ensure that the optimal number of threads are used, set the value of the threading system properties to the sum of the number of CPUs plus one.

. In your {PRODUCT} installation directory, navigate to the `standalone-full.xml` file. For example, if you use a {EAP}  installation for {PRODUCT}, go to `$EAP_HOME/standalone/configuration/standalone-full.xml`.
. Open the `standalone-full.xml` file.
. Under the `<system-properties>` tag, set the value of the following JVM properties to the number of CPUs plus one:

[source,xml,subs="attributes+"]
----
org.appformer.concurrent.managed.thread.limit
org.appformer.concurrent.unmanaged.thread.limit
org.appformer.concurrent.indexing.thread.limit
org.appformer.concurrent.rest.api.thread.limit
----

NOTE: The number of CPUs plus one is a valid baseline value for all properties. You might have to fine-tune further based on additional testing.
