= {OpenShift}
{OpenShift} (OpenShift) uses Kubernetes and provides an API to manage these services. OpenShift enables you to create and manage containers.

In this solution, components of {PRODUCT} are deployed as separate OpenShift pods. You can scale each of the pods up and down individually, providing as few or as many containers as necessary for a particular component. You can use standard OpenShift methods to manage the pods and balance the load.

You can install both {CENTRAL} and {KIE_SERVER} on OpenShift.
