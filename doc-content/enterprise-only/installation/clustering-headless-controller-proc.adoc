= Clustering with the {HEADLESS_CONTROLLER}

The {CONTROLLER} is integrated with {CENTRAL}. However, if you do not install {CENTRAL}, you can install the {HEADLESS_CONTROLLER} and use the REST API or the {KIE_SERVER} Java Client API to interact with it.

.Prerequisites
* A backed-up {EAP} installation version 7.1 or later is available. The base directory of the {EAP} installation is referred to as `__EAP_HOME__`.
* Sufficient user permissions to complete the installation are granted.
* An NFS server with a mounted partition is available.

.Procedure
. Navigate to the https://access.redhat.com/jbossnetwork/restricted/listSoftware.html[Software Downloads] page in the Red Hat Customer Portal (login required), and select the product and version from the drop-down options:

* *Product: {PRODUCT_SHORT}*
* *Version: {PRODUCT_VERSION}*
. Download *{PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION_LONG} Add Ons* (the `{PRODUCT_FILE}-add-ons.zip` file).
. Unzip the `{PRODUCT_FILE}-add-ons.zip` file. The `{PRODUCT_INIT}-{PRODUCT_VERSION}-controller-ee7.zip` file is in the unzipped directory.
. Extract the `{PRODUCT_INIT}-{PRODUCT_VERSION}-controller-ee7.zip` file to a temporary directory. In the following examples this directory is called `_TEMP_DIR_`.

. Repackage the `controller.war` directory:
.. Navigate to the `_TEMP_DIR_/{PRODUCT_FILE}-add-ons/{PRODUCT_INIT}-{PRODUCT_VERSION}-controller-ee7/controller.war` directory.
.. Select the contents of the  `_TEMP_DIR_/{PRODUCT_FILE}-add-ons/{PRODUCT_INIT}-{PRODUCT_VERSION}-controller-ee7/controller.war` directory and create the `controller.zip` file.
.. Rename `controller.zip` to `controller.war`. This is the file that you will use to deploy the {HEADLESS_CONTROLLER} on the cluster nodes.
.. If desired, copy the new `controller.war` file to a location that is more convenient to deploy from.

. If you want to use a security manager with the {HEADLESS_CONTROLLER}, copy the contents of the  `_TEMP_DIR_/{PRODUCT_FILE}-add-ons/{PRODUCT_INIT}-{PRODUCT_VERSION}-controller-ee7/SecurityPolicy`
directory to the `_EAP_HOME_/bin` directory on each node of the cluster.
. Add {EAP} management users to the master node (where you configured the `domain.xml` file) as described in the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_enterprise_application_platform/7.1/html-single/configuration_guide/[_{EAP} 7.1 Configuration Guide_].
. On each node of the cluster, add users for the {HEADLESS_CONTROLLER} as described in the "Installing the {HEADLESS_CONTROLLER}" section of the {URL_INSTALLING_ON_EAP}[_{INSTALLING_ON_EAP}_].

. Complete the following steps in the `host.xml` file on the master node and in the `host-slave.xml` file on each slave node:
.. Open the `_EAP_HOME_/domain/configuration/host.xml` or `_EAP_HOME_/domain/configuration/host-slave.xml` file in a text editor.
.. In the `main-server-group` `<servers>` element, add the servers that will be part of the cluster.
.. Add the following properties to the `<system-properties>` element and replace `<NFS_STORAGE>` with the absolute path to the NFS storage where the template configuration is stored.

[source]
----
<system-properties>
  <property name="org.kie.server.controller.templatefile.watcher.enabled" value="true"/>
  <property name="org.kie.server.controller.templatefile" value="<NFS_STORAGE>"/>
</system-properties>
----
+
If the value of the `org.kie.server.controller.templatefile.watcher.enabled` property is set to `true`, a separate thread is started to watch for modifications of the template file. The default interval for these checks is 30000 milliseconds and can be further controlled by the `org.kie.server.controller.templatefile.watcher.interval` system property. If the value of this property is set to `false`, changes to the template file are detected only when the server restarts.

. To deploy the `controller.war` file that you created previously into the server group, complete the following steps on the master node:
.. Log in to the {EAP} `Administration` console of your domain as a `management` user.
.. Click *Deployments -> Server Groups-> main-server-group* and click *Add*.
.. In the dialog box, click *Upload a new deployment* and click *Next*.
.. In the *Upload Deployments* dialog box, click *Browse*, select the `controller.war` file, and click *Next*.
.. Click *Enable* and  click *Next*.

[NOTE]
====
Make sure to check deployment unit readiness with every cluster member.

When a deployment unit is created on a cluster node, it takes some time before it is distributed among all cluster members. You can check the deployment status using the server Administration console or REST API. However, if the query is sent to the node where the deployment was originally issued, the query will return a value of `deployed`. If the query is sent to a node where the deployment has not yet been distributed, the query returns `DeploymentNotFoundException`.
