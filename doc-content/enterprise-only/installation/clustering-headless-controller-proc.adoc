= Clustering with the {HEADLESS_CONTROLLER}

The {CONTROLLER} is integrated with {CENTRAL}. However, if you do not install {CENTRAL}, you can install the {HEADLESS_CONTROLLER} and use the REST API or the {KIE_SERVER} Java Client API to interact with it.

.Prerequisites
* A backed-up {EAP} installation version 7.1 or later is available. The base directory of the {EAP} installation is referred to as `__EAP_HOME__`.
* Sufficient user permissions to complete the installation are granted.
* An NFS server with a mounted partition is available.

.Procedure
. Navigate to the https://access.redhat.com/jbossnetwork/restricted/listSoftware.html[Software Downloads] page in the Red Hat Customer Portal (login required), and select the product and version from the drop-down options:

* *Product: {PRODUCT_SHORT}*
* *Version: {PRODUCT_VERSION}*
. Download *{PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION_LONG} Add Ons* (the `{PRODUCT_FILE}-add-ons.zip` file).
. Unzip the `{PRODUCT_FILE}-add-ons.zip` file. The `{PRODUCT_INIT}-{PRODUCT_VERSION}-controller-ee7.zip` file is in the unzipped directory.
<<<<<<< HEAD
. Extract the `{PRODUCT_INIT}-{PRODUCT_VERSION}-controller-ee7.zip` file to a temporary directory. In the following examples this directory is called `_TEMP_DIR_`.

. Repackage the `controller.war` directory:
.. Navigate to the `_TEMP_DIR_/{PRODUCT_FILE}-add-ons/{PRODUCT_INIT}-{PRODUCT_VERSION}-controller-ee7/controller.war` directory.
.. Select the contents of the  `_TEMP_DIR_/{PRODUCT_FILE}-add-ons/{PRODUCT_INIT}-{PRODUCT_VERSION}-controller-ee7/controller.war` directory and create the `controller.zip` file.
.. Rename `controller.zip` to `controller.war`. This is the file that you will use to deploy the {HEADLESS_CONTROLLER} on the cluster nodes.
.. If desired, copy the new `controller.war` file to a location that is more convenient to deploy from.

. If you want to use a security manager with the {HEADLESS_CONTROLLER}, copy the contents of the  `_TEMP_DIR_/{PRODUCT_FILE}-add-ons/{PRODUCT_INIT}-{PRODUCT_VERSION}-controller-ee7/SecurityPolicy`
directory to the `_EAP_HOME_/bin` directory on each node of the cluster.
. Add {EAP} management users to the master node (where you configured the `domain.xml` file) as described in the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_enterprise_application_platform/7.1/html-single/configuration_guide/[_{EAP} 7.1 Configuration Guide_].
. On each node of the cluster, add users for the {HEADLESS_CONTROLLER} as described in the "Installing the {HEADLESS_CONTROLLER}" section of {URL_INSTALLING_ON_EAP}[_{INSTALLING_ON_EAP}_].

. Complete the following steps in the `host.xml` file on the master node and in the `host-slave.xml` file on each slave node:
.. Open the `_EAP_HOME_/domain/configuration/host.xml` or `_EAP_HOME_/domain/configuration/host-slave.xml` file in a text editor.
.. In the `main-server-group` `<servers>` element, add the servers that will be part of the cluster.
.. Add the following properties to the `<system-properties>` element and replace `<NFS_STORAGE>` with the absolute path to the NFS storage where the template configuration is stored.

----
<system-properties>
  <property name="org.kie.server.controller.templatefile.watcher.enabled" value="true"/>
  <property name="org.kie.server.controller.templatefile" value="<NFS_STORAGE>"/>
</system-properties>
----
+
If the value of the `org.kie.server.controller.templatefile.watcher.enabled` property is set to `true`, a separate thread is started to watch for modifications of the template file. The default interval for these checks is 30000 milliseconds and can be further controlled by the `org.kie.server.controller.templatefile.watcher.interval` system property. If the value of this property is set to `false`, changes to the template file are detected only when the server restarts.

. To deploy the `controller.war` file that you created previously into the server group, complete the following steps on the master node:
.. Log in to the {EAP} `Administration` console of your domain as a `management` user.
.. Click *Deployments -> Server Groups-> main-server-group* and click *Add*.
.. In the dialog box, click *Upload a new deployment* and click *Next*.
.. In the *Upload Deployments* dialog box, click *Browse*, select the `controller.war` file, and click *Next*.
.. Click *Enable* and  click *Next*.
=======
. Extract the `{PRODUCT_INIT}-{PRODUCT_VERSION}-controller-ee7` archive to a temporary directory. In the following examples this directory is called `__TEMP_DIR__`.
. Copy the `__TEMP_DIR__/{PRODUCT_INIT}-{PRODUCT_VERSION}-controller-ee7/controller.war` directory to `__EAP_HOME__/standalone/deployments/`.

WARNING: Ensure that the names of the {HEADLESS_CONTROLLER} deployments you are copying do not conflict with your existing deployments in the {EAP} instance.

. Copy the contents of the `__TEMP_DIR__/{PRODUCT_INIT}-{PRODUCT_VERSION}-controller-ee7/SecurityPolicy/` directory to `__EAP_HOME__/bin`. When asked to overwrite files, select *Yes*.
. In the `__EAP_HOME__/standalone/deployments/` directory, create an empty file named `controller.war.dodeploy`. This file ensures that the {HEADLESS_CONTROLLER} is automatically deployed when the server starts.
