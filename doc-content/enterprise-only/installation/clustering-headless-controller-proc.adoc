[id='clustering-headless-controller-proc']
= Clustering {KIE_SERVERS} with the {HEADLESS_CONTROLLER}

The {CONTROLLER} is integrated with {CENTRAL}. However, if you do not install {CENTRAL}, you can install the {HEADLESS_CONTROLLER} and use the REST API or the {KIE_SERVER} Java Client API to interact with it.

.Prerequisites
* A backed-up {EAP} installation version 7.2 or later is available. The base directory of the {EAP} installation is referred to as `__EAP_HOME__`.
* Sufficient user permissions to complete the installation are granted.
* An NFS server with a mounted partition is available as described in
ifeval::["{context}" == "execution-server"]
{URL_INSTALLING_ON_EAP_CLUSTER}#nfs-server-configure-proc[_{INSTALLING_ON_EAP_CLUSTER}_].

.Procedure
. Navigate to the https://access.redhat.com/jbossnetwork/restricted/listSoftware.html[Software Downloads] page in the Red Hat Customer Portal (login required), and select the product and version from the drop-down options:

* *Product: {PRODUCT_SHORT}*
* *Version: {PRODUCT_VERSION}*
. Download *{PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION_LONG} Add Ons* (the `{PRODUCT_FILE}-add-ons.zip` file).
. Unzip the `{PRODUCT_FILE}-add-ons.zip` file. The `{PRODUCT_INIT}-{PRODUCT_VERSION_LONG}-controller-ee7.zip` file is in the unzipped directory.
. Extract the `{PRODUCT_INIT}-{PRODUCT_VERSION_LONG}-controller-ee7` archive to a temporary directory. In the following examples this directory is called `__TEMP_DIR__`.
. Copy the `__TEMP_DIR__/{PRODUCT_INIT}-{PRODUCT_VERSION_LONG}-controller-ee7/controller.war` directory to `__EAP_HOME__/standalone/deployments/`.
+
WARNING: Ensure that the names of the {HEADLESS_CONTROLLER} deployments you copy do not conflict with your existing deployments in the {EAP} instance.

. Copy the contents of the `__TEMP_DIR__/{PRODUCT_INIT}-{PRODUCT_VERSION_LONG}-controller-ee7/SecurityPolicy/` directory to `__EAP_HOME__/bin`. When asked to overwrite files, select *Yes*.
. In the `__EAP_HOME__/standalone/deployments/` directory, create an empty file named `controller.war.dodeploy`. This file ensures that the {HEADLESS_CONTROLLER} is automatically deployed when the server starts.
. Open the `_EAP_HOME_/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml` file in a text editor.
. Add the following properties to the `<system-properties>` element and replace `<NFS_STORAGE>` with the absolute path to the NFS storage where the template configuration is stored:
+
[source]
----
<system-properties>
  <property name="org.kie.server.controller.templatefile.watcher.enabled" value="true"/>
  <property name="org.kie.server.controller.templatefile" value="<NFS_STORAGE>"/>
</system-properties>
----
+
Template files contain default configurations for specific deployment scenarios.
+
If the value of the `org.kie.server.controller.templatefile.watcher.enabled` property is set to true, a separate thread is started to watch for modifications of the template file. The default interval for these checks is 30000 milliseconds and can be further controlled by the `org.kie.server.controller.templatefile.watcher.interval` system property. If the value of this property is set to false, changes to the template file are detected only when the server restarts.

. To start the {HEADLESS_CONTROLLER}, navigate to `__EAP_HOME__/bin` and enter the following command:
** On Linux or UNIX-based systems:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ ./standalone.sh
----
** On Windows:
+
[source,bash]
----
standalone.bat
