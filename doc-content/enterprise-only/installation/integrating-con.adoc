= Integrating with {PRODUCT}
You can integrate {PRODUCT} with other products and components, such as Spring Boot, Red Hat Fuse, and {RH-SSO}.

== {PRODUCT} Spring Boot business applications

Spring Framework is a Java platform that provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing Java applications. Spring Boot is a lightweight framework based on Spring Boot starters. Spring Boot starters are `pom.xml` files that contain a set of dependency descriptors that you can include in your Spring Boot project. Red Hat offers support and maintenance for {PRODUCT} Spring Boot projects as part of Red Hat Runtimes.

{PRODUCT} Spring Boot business applications are flexible, UI-agnostic logical groupings of individual services that provide certain business capabilities. Business applications are based on Spring Boot starters. They are usually deployed separately and can be versioned individually. A complete business application enables a domain to achieve specific business goals, for example order management or accommodation management.

On the https://start.jbpm.org[business application] website you can create a Process Automation Manager, Decision Manager, or Business Optimizer business application. After you create and configure your business application, you can deploy it to an existing service or to the cloud, through OpenShift.

== Integrating {FUSE_LONG}
{FUSE} is a distributed, cloud-native integration platform that is part of an agile integration solution. Its distributed approach enables teams to deploy integrated services where required.

You can install {FUSE_LONG} on the Apache Karaf container platform or {EAP_LONG} and then install and configure {PRODUCT} in that container.


== Integrating {RH-SSO}
{RH-SSO} (RH-SSO) is a single sign-on solution that you can use to secure your browser applications with your REST web services and Git access.

When you integrate {PRODUCT} with RH-SSO, you create an SSO and identity management (IDM) environment for {PRODUCT}. The session management feature of RH-SSO enables you to use a single authentication for different {PRODUCT} environments on the internet.

RH-SSO 7.3 is supported with {PRODUCT} on {EAP} {EAP_VERSION}.
