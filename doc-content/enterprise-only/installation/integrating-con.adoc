= Integrating with {PRODUCT}
You can integrate {PRODUCT} with other products and components, such as Spring Boot, Red Hat Fuse, and {RH-SSO}.

== {PRODUCT} Spring Boot business applications

Spring Framework is a Java platform that provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing Java applications. Spring Boot is a lightweight framework based on Spring Boot starters. Spring Boot starters are `pom.xml` files that contain a set of dependency descriptors that you can include in your Spring Boot project. Red Hat offers support and maintenance for {PRODUCT} Spring Boot projects as part of Red Hat Runtimes.

{PRODUCT} Spring Boot business applications are flexible, UI-agnostic logical groupings of individual services that provide certain business capabilities. Business applications are based on Spring Boot starters. They are usually deployed separately and can be versioned individually. A complete business application enables a domain to achieve specific business goals, for example order management or accommodation management.

On the https://start.jbpm.org[business application] website you can create a Process Automation Manager, Decision Manager, or {PLANNER} business application. After you create and configure your business application, you can deploy it to an existing service or to the cloud, through OpenShift.

== Integrating {FUSE_LONG}
{FUSE} is a distributed, cloud-native integration platform that is part of an agile integration solution. Its distributed approach enables teams to deploy integrated services where required.

You can install {FUSE_LONG} on the Apache Karaf container platform or {EAP_LONG} and then install and configure {PRODUCT} in that container.


== Integrating {RH-SSO}
{RH-SSO} (RH-SSO) is a single sign-on solution that you can use to secure your browser applications with your REST web services and Git access.

When you integrate {PRODUCT} with RH-SSO, you create an SSO and identity management (IDM) environment for {PRODUCT}. The session management feature of RH-SSO enables you to use a single authentication for different {PRODUCT} environments on the internet.

{PRODUCT} supports RH-SSO {RH-SSO_VERSION} on {EAP} {EAP_VERSION}.
