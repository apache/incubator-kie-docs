= {PRODUCT} roles and users

To access {CENTRAL} or {KIE_SERVER}, you must create users and assign them appropriate roles before the servers are started.

The {CENTRAL} and {KIE_SERVER} use Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS) login module to authenticate the users. If both {CENTRAL} and {KIE_SERVER} are running on a single instance, then they share the same JAAS subject and security domain. Therefore, a user, who is authenticated for {CENTRAL} can also access {KIE_SERVER}.

However, if {CENTRAL} and {KIE_SERVER} are running on different instances, then the JAAS login module is triggered for both individually. Therefore, a user, who is authenticated for {CENTRAL}, needs to be authenticated separately to access the {KIE_SERVER} (for example, to view or manage process definitions in {CENTRAL}). In case, the user is not authenticated on the {KIE_SERVER}, then 401 error is logged in the log file, displaying `Invalid credentials to load data from remote server. Contact your system administrator.` message in {CENTRAL}.

This section describes available {PRODUCT} user roles.

[NOTE]
====
The `admin`,  `analyst`,
ifdef::PAM[]
`developer`, `manager`, `process-admin`, `user`,
endif::[]
 and `rest-all` roles are reserved for {CENTRAL}. The `kie-server` role is reserved for {KIE_SERVER}. For this reason, the available roles can differ depending on whether {CENTRAL}, {KIE_SERVER}, or both are installed.
====

* `admin`: Users with the `admin` role are the {CENTRAL} administrators. They can manage users and create, clone, and manage the repositories. They have full access to make required changes in the application. Users with the `admin` role have access to all areas within {PRODUCT}.
* `analyst`: Users with the `analyst` role have access to all high-level features. They can model

and execute their
endif::PAM[]
projects. However, these users cannot add contributors to spaces or delete spaces in the *Design -> Projects* view. Access to the *Deploy -> Execution Servers* view, which is intended for administrators, is not available to users with the `analyst` role. However, the *Deploy* button is available to these users when they access the Library perspective.
ifdef::PAM[]
* `developer`: Users with the `developer` role have access to almost all features and can manage rules, models, process flows, forms, and dashboards. They can manage the asset repository, they can create, build, and deploy projects, and they can use Red Hat CodeReady Studio to view processes. Only certain administrative functions such as creating and cloning a new repository are hidden from users with the `developer` role.
* `manager`: Users with the `manager` role can view reports. These users are usually interested in statistics about the business processes and their performance, business indicators, and other business-related reporting. A user with this role has access only to process and task reports.
* `process-admin`: Users with the `process-admin` role are business process administrators. They have full access to business processes, business tasks, and execution errors. These users can also view business reports and have access to the Task Inbox list.
* `user`: Users with the `user` role can work on the Task Inbox list, which contains business tasks that are part of currently running processes. Users with this role can view process and task reports and manage processes.
endif::PAM[]

* `rest-all`: Users with the `rest-all` role can access {CENTRAL} REST capabilities.
* `kie-server`: Users with the `kie-server` role can access {KIE_SERVER} (KIE Server) REST capabilities.
ifdef::PAM[]
This role is mandatory for users to have access to *Manage* and *Track* views in {CENTRAL}.
