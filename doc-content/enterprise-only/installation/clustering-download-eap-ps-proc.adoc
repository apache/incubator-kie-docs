= Downloading and extracting {EAP} 7.2 and {KIE_SERVER}
Complete the steps in this section to download and install {EAP} 7.2 and {KIE_SERVER} for installation in a clustered environment.

.Procedure
. Download {EAP} 7.2 on each node of the cluster:
.. Navigate to the https://access.redhat.com/jbossnetwork/restricted/listSoftware.html[Software Downloads] page in the Red Hat Customer Portal (login required) and select the product and version from the drop-down options:
* *Product: Enterprise Application Platform*
* *Version: 7.2*
.. Click *Download* next to *Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.2.0*. (`jboss-eap-7.2.0.zip`).
. Extract the `jboss-eap-7.2.0.zip` file. The `jboss-eap-7.2/jboss-eap-7.2` directory is referred to as `_EAP_HOME_`.
. Download and apply the latest {EAP} patch, if available.
. Download {KIE_SERVER}:
.. Navigate to the https://access.redhat.com/jbossnetwork/restricted/listSoftware.html[Software Downloads] page in the Red Hat Customer Portal and select the product and version from the drop-down options:
* *Product: {PRODUCT_SHORT}*
* *Version: {PRODUCT_VERSION}*
.. Download  *{PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION_LONG} {KIE_SERVER} for All Supported EE7 Containers* (`{PRODUCT_FILE}-kie-server-ee7.zip`).
. Extract the `{PRODUCT_FILE}-kie-server-ee7.zip` archive to a temporary directory. In the following examples this directory is called `__TEMP_DIR__`.
. Copy the
ifdef::PAM[]
`__TEMP_DIR__/{PRODUCT_FILE}-kie-server-ee7/{PRODUCT_FILE}-kie-server-ee7/kie-server.war`
endif::PAM[]
ifdef::DM[]
`__TEMP_DIR__/{PRODUCT_FILE}-kie-server-ee7/{PRODUCT_FILE}-kie-server-ee7/kie-server.war`
endif::DM[]
 directory to `__EAP_HOME__/standalone/deployments/`.

WARNING: Ensure the names of the {PRODUCT} deployments you are copying do not conflict with your existing deployments in the {EAP} instance.
. Copy the contents of the
ifdef::PAM[]
`__TEMP_DIR__/{PRODUCT_FILE}-kie-server-ee7/{PRODUCT_FILE}-kie-server-ee7/SecurityPolicy/`
endif::PAM[]
ifdef::DM[]
`__TEMP_DIR__/{PRODUCT_FILE}-kie-server-ee7/{PRODUCT_FILE}-kie-server-ee7/SecurityPolicy/`
endif::DM[]
 to `__EAP_HOME__/bin`. When asked to overwrite files, click *Replace*.
. In the `__EAP_HOME__/standalone/deployments/` directory, create an empty file named `kie-server.war.dodeploy`. This file ensures that {KIE_SERVER} is automatically deployed when the server starts.
. Download and apply the latest {PRODUCT} patch, if available.

ifdef::DM[]
. Save the `standalone-full.xml` file.
. To start the cluster, navigate to `__EAP_HOME__/bin` and enter one of the following commands:

$ ./standalone.sh -c standalone-full.xml
