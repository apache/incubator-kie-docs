= Downloading and extracting {EAP} 7.1 and {KIE_SERVER}
Complete the steps in this section to download and install {EAP} 7.1 and download and repackage {KIE_SERVER} for installation in a clustered environment.

.Procedure
. Install {EAP} 7.1 on each node of the cluster:
.. Navigate to the https://access.redhat.com/jbossnetwork/restricted/listSoftware.html[Software Downloads] page in the Red Hat Customer Portal (login required) and select the product and version from the drop-down options:
* *Product: Enterprise Application Platform*
* *Version: 7.1*
.. Click *Download* next to *Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.1.0*. (`jboss-eap-7.1.0.zip`).
.. Extract the `jboss-eap-7.1.0.zip` file. The `jboss-eap-7.1/jboss-eap-7.1` directory is referred to as `_EAP_HOME_`.

. Download and extract {KIE_SERVER}:
.. Navigate to the https://access.redhat.com/jbossnetwork/restricted/listSoftware.html[Software Downloads] page in the Red Hat Customer Portal and select the product and version from the drop-down options:
* *Product: {PRODUCT_SHORT}*
* *Version: {PRODUCT_VERSION}*
* Download  *{PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION_LONG} {KIE_SERVER} for All Supported EE7 Containers* (`{PRODUCT_FILE}-kie-server-ee7.zip`).

.. Extract the `{PRODUCT_FILE}-kie-server-ee7.zip` archive to a temporary directory. In the following examples this directory is called `_TEMP_DIR_`.
. Repackage the `kie-server.war` directory:
.. Navigate to the `_TEMP_DIR_/{PRODUCT_FILE}-kie-server-ee7/kie-server.war` directory.
.. Select the contents of the  `_TEMP_DIR_/{PRODUCT_FILE}-kie-server-ee7/kie-server.war` directory and create the `kie-server.zip` file.
..  Rename `kie-server.zip` to `kie-server.war`. This is the file that you will use to deploy {KIE_SERVER} on the cluster nodes.
.. If desired, copy the new `kie-server.war` file to a location that is more convenient to deploy from.

. If you want to use a security manager with {KIE_SERVER}, copy the contents of the `__TEMP_DIR__/{PRODUCT_FILE}-kie-server-ee7/SecurityPolicy`
directory to the `_EAP_HOME_/bin` directory on each node of the cluster.
