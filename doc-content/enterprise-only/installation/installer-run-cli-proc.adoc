= Using the installer in CLI mode

You can use the command-line interface (CLI) to run the {PRODUCT_PAM} installer.

ifdef::DM[]

NOTE: {PRODUCT} is a subset of {PRODUCT_PAM}. You must install {PRODUCT_PAM} in order to use {PRODUCT}.

endif::[]

[NOTE]
====
For security reasons, you should run the installer as a non-root user.
====

.Prerequisites
* The *{PRODUCT_PAM} {PRODUCT_VERSION_LONG} Installer* has been downloaded. For instructions, see xref:install-download-proc_{context}[].
* A supported JDK is installed. For a list of supported JDKs, see
ifdef::PAM[]
https://access.redhat.com/articles/3405381[{PRODUCT_PAM} 7 Supported Configurations].
endif::[]
ifdef::DM[]
https://access.redhat.com/articles/3354301[{PRODUCT_PAM} 7 Supported Configurations].
endif::[]
* A backed-up

{EAP} {EAP_VERSION}

ifeval::["{context}" == "install-on-jws"]
{JWS} {JWS_VERSION_LONG}
endif::[]
 server installation is available.
* Sufficient user permissions to complete the installation are granted.
+
ifeval::["{context}" == "install-on-jws"]
[NOTE]
====
Ensure that you are logged in with a user that has write permission for Tomcat.
====

* The JAR binary is included in the `$PATH` environment variable. On Red Hat Enterprise Linux, it is included in the `java-$_JAVA_VERSION_-openjdk-devel` package.

[NOTE]
====
{PRODUCT_PAM} is designed to work with UTF-8 encoding. If a different encoding system is used by the underlying JVM, unexpected errors might occur. To ensure UTF-8 is used by the JVM, use the `"-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8"` system property. For a list of system properties, see xref:business-central-system-properties-ref_{context}[].

.Procedure
. In a terminal window, navigate to the directory where you downloaded the installer file and enter the following command:
+
[source,subs="attributes+"]
----
java -jar {PRODUCT_INIT}-installer-{PRODUCT_VERSION_LONG}.jar -console
----
+
The command-line interactive process will start and display the End-User License Agreement.
+
[source,subs="attributes+"]
----
press 1 to continue, 2 to quit, 3 to redisplay.
----
. Read the license agreement, enter `1`, and press `Enter` to continue:
+
[source,subs="attributes+"]
----
Specify the home directory of one of the following servers:  {EAP} 7 or {JWS} 5. For more information, see https://access.redhat.com/articles/3405381[{PRODUCT_PAM} 7 Supported Configurations].
----
+
. Enter the parent directory of an existing
ifeval::["{context}" == "install-on-eap"]
{EAP} {EAP_VERSION}
endif::[]
ifeval::["{context}" == "install-on-jws"]
{JWS} {JWS_VERSION_LONG}
endif::[]
 installation.
+
The installer will verify the location of the installation at the location provided. Enter `1` to confirm and continue.
+
ifeval::["{context}" == "install-on-eap"]
[NOTE]
====
You can install {CENTRAL} and {KIE_SERVER} on the same server. However, you should install {CENTRAL} and {KIE_SERVER} on different servers in production environments.
====
endif::[]
. Follow the instructions in the installer to complete the installation.
+
[NOTE]
====
When you create the user name and password, make sure that the specified user name does not conflict with any known title of a role or a group. For example, if there is a role called `admin`, you should not create a user with the user name `admin`.

The password must have at least eight characters and must contain at least one number and one non-alphanumeric character (_not_ including the character `&`).

Make a note of the user name and password. You will need them to access {CENTRAL} and {KIE_SERVER}.
====

+
. When the installation has completed, you will see this message:
+
[source,subs="attributes+"]
----
Would you like to generate an automatic installation script and properties file?
----
. Enter `y` to create XML files that contain the installation data, or `n` to complete the installation. If you enter `y`, you are prompted to specify a path for the XML files.
. Enter a path or press the Enter key to accept the suggested path.
+
The installer generates two files. The `auto.xml` file automates future installations and the `auto.xml.variables` file stores user passwords and other sensitive variables.
Use the `auto.xml` file on multiple systems to easily repeat a {PRODUCT_PAM} installation on the same type of server with the same configuration as the original installation. If necessary, update the `installpath` parameter in the `auto.xml` file. To perform an installation using the XML file, enter the following command:
+
[source,subs="attributes+"]
----
java -jar {PRODUCT_INIT}-installer-{PRODUCT_VERSION_LONG}.jar <path-to-auto.xml-file>
----

ifeval::["{context}" == "install-on-eap"]
. If you installed only {CENTRAL}, repeat these steps to install {KIE_SERVER} on a separate server.
endif::[]
ifeval::["{context}" == "install-on-jws"]
. If you installed only {KIE_SERVER}, repeat these steps to install the {HEADLESS_CONTROLLER} on a separate server.
endif::[]

[NOTE]
====
If you use Microsoft SQL Server, make sure you have configured applicable transaction isolation for your database. If you do not, you may experience deadlocks. The recommended configuration is to turn on ALLOW_SNAPSHOT_ISOLATION and READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT by entering the following statements:

[source]
----
ALTER DATABASE <DBNAME> SET ALLOW_SNAPSHOT_ISOLATION ON
ALTER DATABASE <DBNAME> SET READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT ON
