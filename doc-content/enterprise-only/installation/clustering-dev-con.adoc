= {PRODUCT} clusters in a development (authoring) environment

[NOTE]
====
Configuration of {CENTRAL} for high availability is currently technology preview.
====

ifdef::PAM[]
Developers use {PRODUCT} to author rules and processes that assist users with decision making.
endif::[]  
The primary benefit of clustering {PRODUCT} development environments is high availability. If clustering is configured and Developer X is working on Node1 and that node fails, Developer X's work is preserved and visible on any other node of the cluster.

Most development environments consist of {CENTRAL} 
ifdef::PAM[]
for creating rules and processes.
endif::[]
 and at least one {KIE_SERVER}
ifdef::PAM[]
 to test those rules and processes.
endif::[]

To create a {PRODUCT} clustered development environment, you download and extract {EAP} 7.2 and {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}. Then, you configure {EAP} 7.2 with Red Hat JBoss Data Grid and AMQ Broker, a Java messaging server (JMS) broker. Finally, you start the cluster and install {CENTRAL} on each cluster node.

Red Hat JBoss Data Grid is built from the Infinispan open-source software project. It is a distributed highly scaleable full-text search and analytics engine. It contains indexing capabilities that enable you to store, search, and analyze high volumes of data quickly and in near-real time. In a {PRODUCT} clustered environment, it enables you to perform complex and efficient searches across cluster nodes.

A JMS broker is a software component that receives messages, stores them locally, and forwards the messages to a recipient. AMQ Broker enables your applications to communicate with any messaging provider. It specifies how components such as message-driven beans, Enterprise JavaBeans, and servlets can send or receive messages.
