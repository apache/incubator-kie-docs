= {PRODUCT_PAM} clusters in a development (authoring) environment

ifdef::PAM[]
Developers can use {PRODUCT} to author rules and processes that assist users with decision making.

endif::[]
You can configure {PRODUCT_PAM} as a clustered development environment to benefit from high availability. With a clustered environment, if a developer is working on a node and that node fails, that developer's work is preserved and visible on any other node of the cluster.

Most development environments consist of {CENTRAL}
ifdef::PAM[]
for creating rules and processes.
endif::[]
 and at least one {KIE_SERVER}
ifdef::PAM[]
 to test those rules and processes
endif::[]
.

To create a {PRODUCT} clustered development environment, you must perform the following tasks:

. Configure the following components on each system that will be a node of the cluster:

** Configure {EAP} {EAP_VERSION} with {DATAGRID} {DATAGRID_VERSION}.
+
{DATAGRID} is built from the Infinispan open-source software project. It is a distributed in-memory key/value data store that has indexing capabilities that enable you to store, search, and analyze high volumes of data quickly and in near-real time. In a {PRODUCT} clustered environment, it enables you to perform complex and efficient searches across cluster nodes.
** Configure AMQ Broker, a Java messaging server (JMS) broker.
+
A JMS broker is a software component that receives messages, stores them locally, and forwards the messages to a recipient. AMQ Broker enables your applications to communicate with any messaging provider. It specifies how components such as message-driven beans, Enterprise JavaBeans, and servlets can send or receive messages.
** Configure an NFS file server.
. Download {EAP} {EAP_VERSION} and {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}, and then install them on each system that will be a cluster node.
. Configure and start {CENTRAL} on each node of the cluster.
