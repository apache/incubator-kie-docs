= {PRODUCT} clusters in a development (authoring) environment

[NOTE]
====
Configuration of {CENTRAL} for high availability is currently technology preview.
====

ifdef::PAM[]
Developers can use {PRODUCT} to author rules and processes that assist users with decision making.
endif::[]

You can configure {PRODUCT} as a clustered development environment to benefit from high availability. With a clustered environment, if a developer is working on Node1 and that node fails, that developer's work is preserved and visible on any other node of the cluster.

Most development environments consist of {CENTRAL}
ifdef::PAM[]
for creating rules and processes.
endif::[]
 and at least one {KIE_SERVER}
ifdef::PAM[]
 to test those rules and processes.
endif::[]

To create a {PRODUCT} clustered development environment, you must perform the following tasks:

* Configure {EAP} {EAP_VERSION} with {DATAGRID} {DATAGRID_VERSION_LONG} on a machine.
* Configure AMQ Broker, a Java messaging server (JMS) broker, on a machine.
* Configure an NFS file server on a machine.
* Download {EAP} {EAP_VERSION} and {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}, then install them on each machine that is to become a cluster node.
* Configure and start {CENTRAL} on each cluster node to start the operation of the cluster.

{DATAGRID} is built from the Infinispan open-source software project. It is a distributed highly scalable full-text search and analytics engine. It contains indexing capabilities that enable you to store, search, and analyze high volumes of data quickly and in near-real time.  In a {PRODUCT} clustered environment, it enables you to perform complex and efficient searches across cluster nodes.

A JMS broker is a software component that receives messages, stores them locally, and forwards the messages to a recipient. AMQ Broker enables your applications to communicate with any messaging provider. It specifies how components such as message-driven beans, Enterprise JavaBeans, and servlets can send or receive messages.
