= Starting the cluster and distributing {KIE_SERVER}
After you have configured a {EAP} cluster and repackaged {KIE_SERVER}, you must start the cluster and distribute the repackaged `kie-server.war` file.

.Prerequisites
* A {EAP} {EAP_VERSION} cluster is available and the `domain.xml`, `host.xml`, and `host-slave.xml` files have been configured.
* The repackaged `kie-server.war` file is available.

.Procedure
. Add {EAP} management users to the master node (where you configured the `domain.xml` file) by using the `add-user` utility script:
+
* On Linux or UNIX-based systems, enter:
+
[source]
----
<EAP_HOME>/bin/add-user.sh
----
+
* On Windows, enter:
+
[source]
----
<EAP_HOME>\bin\add-user.bat
----
+
For more information about management users, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_enterprise_application_platform/{EAP_VERSION}/html/configuration_guide/jboss_eap_management#management_users[_Management Users] in the _{EAP} {EAP_VERSION} Configuration Guide_.

. Add {KIE_SERVER} users to each node of the cluster by using the `add-user` utility script:
+
* On Linux or UNIX-based systems, enter:
+
[source]
----
<EAP_HOME>/bin/add-user.sh
----
+
* On Windows, enter:
+
[source]
----
<EAP_HOME>\bin\add-user.bat
----
+
During user creation, make sure to answer `yes` to the question `Is this new user going to be used for one AS process to connect to another AS process?`
+
For more information about configuring users on each node of the cluster, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_enterprise_application_platform/{EAP_VERSION}/html-single/how_to_configure_server_security/index#securing_managed_domain[_Securing a Managed Domain_] in the _{EAP} {EAP_VERSION} How to Configure Server Security Guide_.

. To start the master node, enter one of the following commands:
+
* On Linux or UNIX-based systems, enter:
+
[source]
----
<EAP_HOME>/bin/domain.sh
----
+
* On Windows, enter:
+
[source]
----
<EAP_HOME>\bin\domain.bat
----

. To start the slave nodes, on each of the slave nodes enter one of the following commands, where `<MASTER_NODE_IP>` is the IP address of the master node (where the domain controller is configured):
+
* On Linux or UNIX-based systems, enter:
+
[source]
----
<EAP_HOME>/bin/domain.sh --host-config=host-slave.xml -Djboss.domain.master.address=<MASTER_NODE_IP>
----
+
* On Windows, enter:
+
[source]
----
<EAP_HOME>\bin\domain.bat --host-config=host-slave.xml -Djboss.domain.master.address=<MASTER_NODE_IP>
----
+
For more information, see the following sections of the _Red Hat JBoss EAP {EAP_VERSION} Configuration Guide_:
* https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_enterprise_application_platform/{EAP_VERSION}/html/configuration_guide/starting_and_stopping_jboss_eap#starting_jboss_eap["Starting JBoss EAP"]
* https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_enterprise_application_platform/{EAP_VERSION}/html/configuration_guide/jboss_eap_management#managed_domain_configuration_files["Managed Domain Configuration Files"].
. On each node of the cluster, review the `_EAP_HOME_/domain/servers/SERVER_NAME/log/server.log` file to verify that the nodes are available.

. To deploy the `kie-server.war` file that you created previously into the server group, complete the following steps on the master node:
.. Log in to the {EAP} `Administration` console of your domain as a `management` user.
.. Click *Deployments -> Server Groups-> main-server-group* and click *Add*.
.. In the dialog box, click *Upload a new deployment* and click *Next*.
.. In the *Upload Deployments* dialog box, click *Browse*, select the `kie-server.war` file, and click *Next*.
.. Click *Enable* and  click *Next*.
+
[NOTE]
====
Make sure to check deployment unit readiness with every cluster member.

When a deployment unit is created on a cluster node, it takes some time before it is distributed among all cluster members. You can check the deployment status using the server Administration console or REST API. However, if the query is sent to the node where the deployment was originally issued, the query will return a value of `deployed`. If the query is sent to a node where the deployment has not yet been distributed, the query returns `DeploymentNotFoundException`.
====
. To verify that the {KIE_SERVER} main endpoint is available and business process management (BPM) capabilities are enabled, enter the following command and replace `<node_IP>` and `<node_port>` with the IP address and port number of the node you are verifying:
+
[source]
----
curl -u username:password -X GET "http://<node_IP>:<node_port>/kie-server/services/rest/server"
----
+
If the following line is present in the output, BPM capabilities are enabled:
+
[source]
----
<capabilities>BPM</capabilities>
