= Applying patch updates and minor release upgrades to {PRODUCT}

Automated update tools are often provided with both patch updates and new minor versions of {PRODUCT} to facilitate updating certain components of {PRODUCT}, such as {CENTRAL}, {KIE_SERVER}, and the {HEADLESS_CONTROLLER}. Other {PRODUCT} artifacts, such as the {DECISION_ENGINE} and standalone {CENTRAL}, are released as new artifacts with each minor release and you must re-install them to apply the update.

You can use the same automated update tool to apply both patch updates and minor release upgrades to {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}. Patch updates of {PRODUCT}, such as an update from version {PRODUCT_VERSION} to {PRODUCT_VERSION}.1, include the latest security updates and bug fixes. Minor release upgrades of {PRODUCT}, such as an upgrade from version {PRODUCT_VERSION}.x to 7.4, include enhancements, security updates, and bug fixes.

You can update or upgrade {PRODUCT} versions 7.2.x through 7.3.1 directly. For example, you can use the 7.3.0 upgrade tool to upgrade {PRODUCT} 7.2.x to version 7.3.0. Likewise, you can directly upgrade {PRODUCT} 7.2.1 to version 7.3.1. However, you must have {PRODUCT} 7.3.1 to upgrade to version 7.4.0.

NOTE: Only updates for {PRODUCT} are included in {PRODUCT} update tools. Updates to {EAP} must be applied using {EAP} patch distributions. For more information about {EAP} patching, see the {EAP} https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_enterprise_application_platform/7.2/html/patching_and_upgrading_guide/[_Patching and upgrading guide_].

Do not attempt to update EE7 to EE8. It is not supported but the update tool will not prevent you from doing it. If you are updating {PRODUCT} 7.3.0 to 7.3.1, update EE7 only. If you are updating {PRODUCT} 7.3.1 to 7.4.x, update EE8 only.


.Prerequisites
* Your {PRODUCT} and {KIE_SERVER} instances are not running. Do not apply updates while you are running an instance of {PRODUCT} or {KIE_SERVER}.

.Procedure
. Navigate to the https://access.redhat.com/jbossnetwork/restricted/listSoftware.html[Software Downloads] page in the Red Hat Customer Portal (login required), and select the product and version from the drop-down options.
+
--
Example:

* *Product:* {PRODUCT_SHORT}
* *Version:* {PRODUCT_VERSION}.0
--
+
If you are upgrading to {PRODUCT} 7.4.x from 7.2.0 or higher, first apply the 7.3.1 patch update to your current version of {PRODUCT} and then follow this procedure again to upgrade to 7.4.x.
+
. Click *Patches*, download the *{PRODUCT} [VERSION] Update Tool*, and extract the downloaded `{PRODUCT_INIT}-$VERSION-update.zip` file to a temporary directory.
+
This update tool automates the update of certain components of {PRODUCT}, such as {CENTRAL}, {KIE_SERVER}, and the {HEADLESS_CONTROLLER}. Use this update tool first to apply updates and then install any other updates or new release artifacts that are relevant to your {PRODUCT} distribution.
+
. If you want to preserve any files from being updated by the update tool, navigate to the extracted `{PRODUCT_INIT}-$VERSION-update` folder, open the `blacklist.txt` file, and add the relative paths to the files that you do not want to be updated.
+
--
When a file is listed in the `blacklist.txt` file, the update script does not replace the file with the new version but instead leaves the file in place and in the same location adds the new version with a `.new` suffix. If you blacklist files that are no longer being distributed, the update tool creates an empty marker file with a `.removed` suffix. You can then choose to retain, merge, or delete these new files manually.

Example files to be excluded in `blacklist.txt` file:
[source]
----
WEB-INF/web.xml  // Custom file
styles/base.css  // Obsolete custom file kept for record
----

The contents of the blacklisted file directories after the update:
[source]
----
$ ls WEB-INF
web.xml web.xml.new
----

[source]
----
$ ls styles
base.css base.css.removed
----
--
. In your command terminal, navigate to the temporary directory where you extracted the `{PRODUCT_INIT}-$VERSION-update.zip` file and run the `apply-updates` script in the following format:
+
--
IMPORTANT: Make sure that your {PRODUCT} and {KIE_SERVER} instances are not running before you apply updates. Do not apply updates while you are running an instance of {PRODUCT} or {KIE_SERVER}.

On Linux or Unix-based systems:
[source]
----
$ ./apply-updates.sh $DISTRO_PATH $DISTRO_TYPE
----

On Windows:
[source]
----
$ .\apply-updates.bat $DISTRO_PATH $DISTRO_TYPE
----

The `$DISTRO_PATH` portion is the path to the relevant distribution directory and the `$DISTRO_TYPE` portion is the type of distribution that you are updating with this update.

The following distribution types are supported in {PRODUCT} update tool:

* `{PRODUCT_INIT}-{URL_COMPONENT_CENTRAL}-eap7-deployable`: Updates {CENTRAL} (`{URL_COMPONENT_CENTRAL}.war`)
* `{PRODUCT_INIT}-kie-server-ee8`: Updates {KIE_SERVER} (`kie-server.war`)

ifdef::DM[]
* `{PRODUCT_INIT}-kie-server-jws`: Updates {KIE_SERVER} on {JWS} (`kie-server.war`)
endif::DM[]
* `{PRODUCT_INIT}-controller-ee7`: Updates the {HEADLESS_CONTROLLER} (`controller.war`)
ifdef::DM[]
* `{PRODUCT_INIT}-controller-jws`: Updates the {HEADLESS_CONTROLLER} on {JWS} (`controller.war`)
endif::DM[]

Example update to {CENTRAL} and {KIE_SERVER} for a full {PRODUCT} distribution on {EAP}:
[source,subs="attributes+"]
----
./apply-updates.sh ~EAP_HOME/standalone/deployments/{URL_COMPONENT_CENTRAL}.war {PRODUCT_INIT}-{URL_COMPONENT_CENTRAL}-eap7-deployable

./apply-updates.sh ~EAP_HOME/standalone/deployments/kie-server.war {PRODUCT_INIT}-kie-server-ee8
----

Example update to {HEADLESS_CONTROLLER}, if used:
[source,subs="attributes+"]
----
./apply-updates.sh ~EAP_HOME/standalone/deployments/controller.war {PRODUCT_INIT}-controller-ee7
----

The update script creates a `backup` folder in the extracted `{PRODUCT_INIT}-$VERSION-update` folder with a copy of the specified distribution, and then proceeds with the update.
--
. After the update tool completes, return to the *Software Downloads* page of the Red Hat Customer Portal where you downloaded the update tool and install any other updates or new release artifacts that are relevant to your {PRODUCT} distribution.
+
For files that already exist in your {PRODUCT} distribution, such as `.jar` files for the {DECISION_ENGINE} or other add-ons, replace the existing version of the file with the new version from the Red Hat Customer Portal.
. If you use the standalone *{PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION_LONG} Maven Repository* artifact (`{PRODUCT_FILE}-maven-repository.zip`), such as in air-gap environments, download *{PRODUCT} [VERSION] Incremental Maven Repository* and extract the downloaded `{PRODUCT_INIT}-$VERSION-incremental-maven-repository.zip` file to your existing `~/maven-repository` directory to update the relevant contents.
+
--
Example Maven repository update:
[source,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ unzip -o {PRODUCT_INIT}-{PRODUCT_VERSION}.1-incremental-maven-repository.zip -d $REPO_PATH/{PRODUCT_INIT}-{PRODUCT_VERSION}.0-maven-repository/maven-repository/
----
--
. After you finish applying all relevant updates, start {PRODUCT} and {KIE_SERVER} and log in to {CENTRAL}.
. Verify that all project data is present and accurate in {CENTRAL}, and in the top-right corner of the {CENTRAL} window, click your profile name and click *About* to verify the updated product version number.
+
If you encounter errors or notice any missing data in {CENTRAL}, you can restore the contents in the `backup` folder within the `{PRODUCT_INIT}-$VERSION-update` folder to revert the update tool changes. You can also re-install the relevant release artifacts from your previous version of {PRODUCT} in the Red Hat Customer Portal. After restoring your previous distribution, you can try again to run the update.
