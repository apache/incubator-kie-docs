= {PRODUCT} clusters

By clustering two or more computers, you have the benefits of high availability, enhanced collaboration, and load balancing. High availability decreases the chance of data loss when a single computer fails. When a computer fails, another computer fills the gap by providing a copy of the data that was on the failed computer. When the failed computer comes online again, it resumes its place in the cluster.

There are several ways that you can cluster {PRODUCT} components. This document describes how to cluster the following scenarios:
