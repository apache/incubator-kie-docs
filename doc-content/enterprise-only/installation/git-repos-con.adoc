= Git repositories
Git repositories are used internally within {CENTRAL} to store all processes, rules, and other artifacts that are created in the authoring environment. Git is a distributed version control system. It implements revisions as commit objects. When you commit your changes into a repository, a new commit object in the Git repository is created. When you create a project in {CENTRAL}, it is added to the Git repository that is connected to {CENTRAL}.

If you have projects in other Git repositories, you can import them into {CENTRAL} spaces. You can use Git hooks to synchronize the internal Git repositories with external repositories.
