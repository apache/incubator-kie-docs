= Securing passwords with a keystore

You can use a keystore to encrypt passwords that are used for communication between {CENTRAL} and {KIE_SERVER}. You should encrypt both controller and {KIE_SERVER} passwords. If {CENTRAL} and {KIE_SERVER} are deployed to different application servers, then both application servers should use the keystore.

Use Java Cryptography Extension KeyStore (JCEKS) for your keystore because it supports symmetric keys.

[NOTE]
====
If {KIE_SERVER} is not configured with JCEKS, {KIE_SERVER} passwords are stored in system properties in plain text form.
====

.Prerequisites

* {KIE_SERVER} is installed in {WEBSPHERE}.
* A {KIE_SERVER} user with the `kie-server` role has been created, as described in xref:kie-server-was-goup-proc[].
* Java 8 or higher is installed.


.Procedure
. Create a JCEKS keystore.
. When prompted, enter the password for the {KIE_SERVER} user that you created.

. Set the system properties listed in the following table:

|===
| System property
| Placeholder
| Description

| `kie.keystore.keyStoreURL`
| `<KEYSTORE_URL>`
| URL for the JCEKS that you want to use, for example `\file:///home/kie/keystores/keystore.jceks`

| `kie.keystore.keyStorePwd`
| `<KEYSTORE_PWD>`
| Password for the JCEKS

| `kie.keystore.key.server.alias`
| `<KEY_SERVER_ALIAS>`
| Alias of the key for REST services where the password is stored

| `kie.keystore.key.server.pwd`
| `<KEY_SERVER_PWD>`
| Password of the alias for REST services with the stored password

| `kie.keystore.key.ctrl.alias`
| `<KEY_CONTROL_ALIAS>`
| Alias of the key for default REST Process Automation Controller where the password is stored

| `kie.keystore.key.ctrl.key.ctrl.pwd`
| `<KEY_CONTROL_PWD>`
| Password of the alias for default REST  Process Automation Controller with the stored password

|===

. Start {KIE_SERVER} to verify the configuration.
