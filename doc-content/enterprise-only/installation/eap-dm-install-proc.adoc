* Sufficient user permissions to complete the installation are granted.
* The following file is downloaded as described in xref:install-download-proc_{context}[]:
+
ifdef::DM[]
`{PRODUCT_FILE}-{URL_COMPONENT_CENTRAL}-eap7-deployable.zip`
endif::[]
ifdef::PAM[]
`{PRODUCT_FILE}-{URL_COMPONENT_CENTRAL}-eap7-deployable.zip`
endif::[]

`{PRODUCT_FILE}-{URL_COMPONENT_CENTRAL}-eap7-deployable.zip`
endif::[]
ifdef::PAM[]
`{PRODUCT_FILE}-{URL_COMPONENT_CENTRAL}-eap7-deployable.zip`

file to a temporary directory. In the following examples this directory is called `__TEMP_DIR__`.
