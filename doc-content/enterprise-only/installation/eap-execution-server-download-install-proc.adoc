= Installing {KIE_SERVER} from the ZIP file

{KIE_SERVER} provides the runtime environment for business assets and accesses the data stored in the assets repository (knowledge store).

.Prerequisites
* A backed-up {EAP} installation version 7.2 is available. The base directory of the {EAP} installation is referred to as `__EAP_HOME__`.
* Sufficient user permissions to complete the installation are granted.
* The following file is downloaded as described in <<install-download-proc_{context}>>:
+
ifdef::PAM[]
`{PRODUCT_FILE}-kie-server-ee8.zip`
endif::PAM[]
ifdef::DM[]
`{PRODUCT_FILE}-kie-server-ee8.zip`
endif::DM[]

.Procedure
. Extract the
ifdef::PAM[]
`{PRODUCT_FILE}-kie-server-ee8.zip`
endif::PAM[]
ifdef::DM[]
`{PRODUCT_FILE}-kie-server-ee8.zip`
endif::DM[]
 archive to a temporary directory. In the following examples this directory is called `__TEMP_DIR__`.
. Copy the
ifdef::PAM[]
`__TEMP_DIR__/{PRODUCT_FILE}-kie-server-ee8/kie-server.war`
endif::PAM[]
ifdef::DM[]
`__TEMP_DIR__/{PRODUCT_FILE}-kie-server-ee8/kie-server.war`
endif::DM[]
 directory to `_EAP_HOME_/standalone/deployments/`.
+
WARNING: Ensure the names of the {PRODUCT} deployments you copy do not conflict with your existing deployments in the {EAP} instance.
. Copy the contents of the
ifdef::PAM[]
`__TEMP_DIR__/{PRODUCT_FILE}-kie-server-ee8/{PRODUCT_FILE}-kie-server-ee8/SecurityPolicy/`
endif::PAM[]
ifdef::DM[]
`__TEMP_DIR__/{PRODUCT_FILE}-kie-server-ee8/{PRODUCT_FILE}-kie-server-ee8/SecurityPolicy/`
endif::DM[]
 to `__EAP_HOME__/bin`. When asked to overwrite files, click *Replace*.
. In the `__EAP_HOME__/standalone/deployments/` directory, create an empty file named `kie-server.war.dodeploy`. This file ensures that {KIE_SERVER} is automatically deployed when the server starts.

If you use Microsoft SQL Server, make sure you have configured proper transaction isolation for your database. If you do not, you may experience deadlocks. The recommended configuration is to turn on ALLOW_SNAPSHOT_ISOLATION and READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT by entering the following statements:

[source]
----
ALTER DATABASE <DBNAME> SET ALLOW_SNAPSHOT_ISOLATION ON
ALTER DATABASE <DBNAME> SET READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT ON
