= {PRODUCT} reference implementations

{PRODUCT} provides reference implementations that you can use as starter applications. They are included in the *{PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION_LONG} Reference Implementations* download, available on the {PRODUCT} Software Downloads page in the Red Hat Customer Portal.

.Employee Rostering reference implementation
The employee rostering reference implementation enables you to create an application that assigns employees to shifts on various positions in an organization. For example, you can use the application to distribute shifts in a hospital between nurses, guard duty shifts across a number of locations, or shifts on an assembly line between workers.

.Vehicle route planning reference implementation
The vehicle route planning reference implementation enables you to create an application that solves a vehicle route planning problem with real-world maps, roads, and vehicles delivering goods to locations, each with a specific capacity. For more information, see the README file in the vehicle routing ZIP file, included in the reference implementation download.

.School timetable reference implementation
The school timetable reference implementation enables you to build a REST application on Spring Boot that associates lessons with rooms and time slots and avoids conflicts by considering student and teacher constraints.

.High available event-driven decisioning reference implementation
The high available event-driven decisioning reference implementation enables you to deploy {PRODUCT_DROOLS} engine code that requires stateful processing, including rules developed with complex event processing, in an OpenShift environment. Doing this enables the {DECISION_ENGINE} to process complex event series with high availability.
