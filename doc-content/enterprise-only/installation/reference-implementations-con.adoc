= Available reference implementations

Two reference implementations are available that you can use as starter applications.

.Employee Rostering reference implementation
The employee rostering reference implementation enables you to create an application that assigns employees to shifts on various positions in an organization. For example, you can use the application to distribute shifts in a hospital between nurses, guard duty shifts across a number of locations, or shifts on an assembly line between workers.

.HA CEP reference implemntation
You can use the HA CEP reference implementation to create a custom implementation of HA CEP on {OPENSHIFT}. HA CEP enables you to use Complex Event Processing (CEP) in your code that uses the decision engine to implement high-availability rule processing on {OPENSHIFT}.
