= Configuring {KIE_SERVER} to connect to {CENTRAL}

WARNING: This section provides a sample setup that you can use for testing purposes. Some of the values are unsuitable for a production environment, and are marked as such.

If a {KIE_SERVER} is not configured in your {PRODUCT} environment, or if you require additional {KIE_SERVERS} in your {PRODUCT} environment, you must configure a {KIE_SERVER} to connect to {CENTRAL}.

[NOTE]
====
If you are deploying {KIE_SERVER} on {OPENSHIFT}, see the {URL_DEPLOYING_ON_OPENSHIFT}#assembly-openshift-operator[_{DEPLOYING_OPENSHIFT_OPERATOR}_] document for instructions about configuring it to connect to {CENTRAL}.
====

ifeval::["{context}" == "execution-server"]
{KIE_SERVER} can be managed or unmanaged. If {KIE_SERVER} is unmanaged, you must manually create and maintain KIE containers (deployment units). If {KIE_SERVER} is managed, the {CONTROLLER} manages the {KIE_SERVER} configuration and you interact with the {CONTROLLER} to create and maintain the KIE containers.

[NOTE]
====
Make the changes described in this section if {KIE_SERVER} is managed by {CENTRAL} and you have installed {PRODUCT} from the ZIP files.
If you have installed {CENTRAL}, you can use the {HEADLESS_CONTROLLER} to manage {KIE_SERVER}, as described in xref:controller-con_{context}[].
====

.Prerequisites
ifeval::["{context}" == "install-on-eap"]
* {CENTRAL} and {KIE_SERVER} are installed in the base directory of the {EAP} installation (`__EAP_HOME__`) as described in the following sections:
+
** <<eap-dm-install-proc_install-on-eap>>
** <<eap_execution_server_download_install_proc_install-on-eap>>

* Users with the following roles exist:
** In {CENTRAL}, a user with the role `rest-all`
** On the {KIE_SERVER}, a user with the role `kie-server`
+
For more information, see <<eap-users-create-proc_install-on-eap>>.
endif::[]

ifeval::["{context}" == "execution-server"]
* {CENTRAL} and {KIE_SERVER} are installed in the base directory of the {EAP} installation (`__EAP_HOME__`).

[NOTE]
====
You must install {CENTRAL} and {KIE_SERVER} on different servers in production environments. In this sample situation, we use only one user named `controllerUser`, containing both `rest-all` and the `kie-server` roles. However, if you install {KIE_SERVER} and {CENTRAL} on the same server, for example in a development environment, make the changes in the shared `standalone-full.xml` file as described in this section.
====

* Users with the following roles exist:
** In {CENTRAL}, a user with the role `rest-all`
** On the {KIE_SERVER}, a user with the role `kie-server`

.Procedure
. In your {PRODUCT} installation directory, navigate to the `standalone-full.xml` file. For example, if you use a {EAP} installation for {PRODUCT}, go to `$EAP_HOME/standalone/configuration/standalone-full.xml`.
. Open `standalone-full.xml` file and under the `<system-properties>` tag, set the following JVM properties:

----
<property name="org.kie.server.id" value="default-kie-server"/>
<property name="org.kie.server.controller" value="http://localhost:8080/{URL_COMPONENT_CENTRAL}/rest/controller"/>
<property name="org.kie.server.controller.user" value="controllerUser"/>
<property name="org.kie.server.controller.pwd" value="controllerUser1234;"/>
<property name="org.kie.server.location" value="http://localhost:8080/kie-server/services/rest/server"/>

. Send a GET request to `http://_SERVER:PORT_/kie-server/services/rest/server/` and verify the successful start of the {KIE_SERVER}. 
Once authenticated, you receive an XML response similar to the following example:

. Verify the successful registration:
.. Log in to {CENTRAL}.
.. Click *Menu* -> *Deploy* -> *Execution Servers*.
+
If registration is successful, you can see the registered server ID.
