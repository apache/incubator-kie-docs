[id='installer-controller-eap-proc_{context}']
= Using the installer to configure {KIE_SERVER} with the {CONTROLLER}

{KIE_SERVER} can be managed by the {CONTROLLER} or it can be unmanaged. If {KIE_SERVER} is unmanaged, you must manually create and maintain KIE containers (deployment units). If {KIE_SERVER} is managed, the {CONTROLLER} manages the {KIE_SERVER} configuration and you interact with the {CONTROLLER} to create and maintain KIE containers.

The {CONTROLLER} is integrated with {CENTRAL}. If you install {CENTRAL}, you can use the *Execution Server* page in {CENTRAL} to interact with the {CONTROLLER}.

You can use the installer in interactive or CLI mode to install {CENTRAL} and {KIE_SERVER}, and then configure {KIE_SERVER} with the {CONTROLLER}.

[NOTE]
====
If you do not install {CENTRAL}, see <<controller-con>> for information about using the {HEADLESS_CONTROLLER}.
