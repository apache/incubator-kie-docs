= Using the installer to configure {KIE_SERVER} with the Process Automation Manager controller



{KIE_SERVER} can be managed by the 
ifdef::PAM[]
Process Automation Manager controller
endif::[]  
ifdef::DM[]
Decision Server controller
endif::[]
 or it can be unmanaged. If {KIE_SERVER} is unmanaged, you must manually create and maintain containers. If {KIE_SERVER} is managed, the 
ifdef::PAM[]
Process Automation Manager controller
endif::[]  
ifdef::DM[]
Decision Server controller
endif::[]
 manages the {KIE_SERVER} configuration and you interact with the controller to create and maintain containers. 

The 
ifdef::PAM[]
Process Automation Manager controller
endif::[]  
ifdef::DM[]
Decision Server controller
endif::[]
 is integrated with {CENTRAL}. If you install {CENTRAL}, you can use the *Execution Server* page in {CENTRAL} to interact with the controller. 

You can use the installer in interactive or CLI mode to install {CENTRAL} and {KIE_SERVER}, and then configure {KIE_SERVER} with the {PRODUCT_SHORT} controller.

[NOTE]
====
If you do not install {CENTRAL}, see <<controller-con>> for information about using the headless 
ifdef::PAM[]
Process Automation Manager controller

ifdef::DM[]
Decision Server controller
