[id='installer-controller-eap-proc_{context}']
= Using the installer to configure {KIE_SERVER} with the {CONTROLLER}

{KIE_SERVER} can be managed by the {CONTROLLER} or it can be unmanaged. If {KIE_SERVER} is unmanaged, you must manually create and maintain KIE containers (deployment units). If {KIE_SERVER} is managed, the {CONTROLLER} manages the {KIE_SERVER} configuration and you interact with the {CONTROLLER} to create and maintain KIE containers.

The {CONTROLLER} is integrated with {CENTRAL}. If you install {CENTRAL}, you can use the *Execution Server* page in {CENTRAL} to interact with the {CONTROLLER}.

You can use the installer in interactive or CLI mode to install {CENTRAL} and {KIE_SERVER}, and then configure {KIE_SERVER} with the {CONTROLLER}.

.Prerequisites
* Two computers with backed-up {EAP} {EAP_VERSION}  server installations are available.
* Sufficient user permissions to complete the installation are granted.

.Procedure
. On the first computer, run the installer in interactive mode or CLI mode.

. On the *Component Selection* page, clear the *{KIE_SERVER}* box.
. Complete the {CENTRAL} installation.
. On the second computer, run the installer in interactive mode or CLI mode.
. On the *Component Selection* page, clear the *{CENTRAL}* box.
. On the *Configure Runtime Environment* page, select *Perform Advanced Configuration*.
. Select *Customize {KIE_SERVER} properties* and click *Next*.
. Enter the controller URL for {CENTRAL} and configure additional properties for {KIE_SERVER}. The controller URL has the following form where `<HOST:PORT>` is the address of {CENTRAL} on the second computer:
+
[source]
----
<HOST:PORT>/business-central/rest/controller
----
. Complete the installation.
. To verify that the {CONTROLLER} is now integrated with {CENTRAL}, go to the *Execution Servers* page in {CENTRAL} and confirm that the {KIE_SERVER} that you configured appears under *REMOTE SERVERS*.
