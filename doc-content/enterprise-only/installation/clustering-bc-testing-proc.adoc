= Verifying the {PRODUCT} cluster

After you have configured the cluster for {PRODUCT}, create an asset to verify that the installation is working.

.Procedure
. In a terminal window on any node of the cluster, navigate to the `_EAP_HOME_/bin` directory and enter the following command to start {PRODUCT}:
+
[source]
----
./standalone.sh -c standalone-full.xml
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If you deployed {CENTRAL} without {KIE_SERVER}, you can start {CENTRAL} with the `standalone.sh` script without specifying the `standalone-full.xml` file. In this case, ensure that you make any configuration changes to the `standalone.xml` file before starting {CENTRAL}.
====

. In a web browser, enter `<node-IP-address>:8080/{URL_COMPONENT_CENTRAL}`. Replace `<node-IP-address>` with the IP address of a particular node.
. Enter the `admin` user credentials that you created during installation. The {CENTRAL} home page appears.
. Select *Menu* -> *Deploy* -> *Execution Servers*.
. Confirm that *default-kieserver* is listed under *Server Configurations*.
. Select *Menu* -> *Design* -> *Projects*.
. Click *Try Samples* -> *Mortgages* -> *OK*. The Assets window appears.
. Click *Create New Asset* -> *Data Object*.
. Enter `MyDataObject` in the *Data Object* field and click *OK*.
. Click *Spaces* -> *myteam* -> *Mortgages* and confirm that `MyDataObject` is in the list of assets.
. Enter the following URL, where `<node_IP_address>` is the address of a different node of the cluster:
+
`http://<node_IP_address>:8080/{URL_COMPONENT_CENTRAL}`
. Enter the same credentials that you used to log in to {CENTRAL} on the first node, where you created the `MyDataObject` asset.
. Select *Menu*-> *Design* -> *Projects*.
. Select the *Mortgages* project.
. Verify that `MyDataObject` is in the asset list.
. Delete `MyDataObject`.
