= Configuring an NFS server

A shared file system is required for a {CENTRAL} clustered environment and each client node must have access to the shared file system.

You must deploy and configure an NFS version 4 server.

.Procedure

. Configure a server to export NFS version 4 shares. For instructions about exporting NFS shares on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, see _Exporting NFS shares_ in https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/managing_file_systems/index[_Managing file systems_]. For more information about creating the NFS server, see https://access.redhat.com/solutions/1355233[_How to configure NFS in RHEL 7_].

. On the server, create an `/opt/kie/data` share with the `rw,sync,no_root_squash` options by adding the following line to the `/etc/exports` file:
+
[subs="attributes,verbatim,macros"]
----
/opt/kie/data *(rw,sync,no_root_squash)
----
+
In this example, `/opt/kie/data` is the shared folder, `*` are the IP addresses allowed to connect to the NFS server, and `(rw,sync,no_root_squash)` are the minimum options required for NFS. For example:
+
----
/opt/kie/data 192.268.1.0/24(rw,sync,no_root_squash)
----
+
[NOTE]
====
You can use another share name instead of '/opt/kie/data'. In this case, you must use this name when configuring all nodes that run {CENTRAL}.
