= Running the {HEADLESS_CONTROLLER}
After you have installed the {HEADLESS_CONTROLLER} on {EAP}, use this procedure to run the {HEADLESS_CONTROLLER}.

.Prerequisites
* The {HEADLESS_CONTROLLER} is installed and configured in the base directory of the {EAP} installation (`__EAP_HOME__`).

.Procedure
. In a terminal application, navigate to `__EAP_HOME__/bin`.
. If you installed the {HEADLESS_CONTROLLER} on the same {EAP} instance as the {EAP} instance where you installed the {KIE_SERVER}, enter one of the following commands:
* On Linux or UNIX-based systems:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ ./standalone.sh -c standalone-full.xml
----
* On Windows:
+
[source,bash]
----
standalone.bat -c standalone-full.xml
----

. If you installed the {HEADLESS_CONTROLLER} on a separate {EAP} instance from the {EAP} instance where you installed the {KIE_SERVER}, you can start the {HEADLESS_CONTROLLER} with the `standalone.sh` script:

[NOTE]
====
In this case, ensure that you made all required configuration changes to the `standalone.xml` file.
