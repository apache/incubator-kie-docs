= Installing and running the {HEADLESS_CONTROLLER}

You can configure {KIE_SERVER} to run in managed or unmanaged mode. If {KIE_SERVER} is unmanaged, you must manually create and maintain KIE containers (deployment units). If {KIE_SERVER} is managed, the {CONTROLLER} manages the {KIE_SERVER} configuration and you interact with the {CONTROLLER} to create and maintain KIE containers.

{CENTRAL} has an embedded {CONTROLLER}. If you install {CENTRAL}, use the *Execution Server* page to create and maintain KIE containers. If you want to automate {KIE_SERVER} management without {CENTRAL}, you can use the {HEADLESS_CONTROLLER}.
