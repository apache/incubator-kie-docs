= Installing and running the headless {PRODUCT_SHORT} controller

You can configure {KIE_SERVER} to run in managed or unmanaged mode. If {KIE_SERVER} is unmanaged, you must manually create and maintain containers. If {KIE_SERVER} is managed, the {PRODUCT_SHORT} controller manages the {KIE_SERVER} configuration and you interact with the controller to create and maintain containers.

{CENTRAL} has an embedded {PRODUCT_SHORT} controller. If you install {CENTRAL}, use the *Execution Server* page to create and maintain containers. If you want to automate {KIE_SERVER} management without {CENTRAL}, you can use the headless {PRODUCT_SHORT} controller.
