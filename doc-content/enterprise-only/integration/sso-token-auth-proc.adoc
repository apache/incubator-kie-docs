= Token-based authentication

If you want a more secure option of authentication, you can consume the remote services from both {CENTRAL} and {KIE_SERVER} by using a granted token provided by RH-SSO.

.Procedure
. In the RH-SSO Admin Console, click the *Clients* menu item and click *Create* to create a new client.
+
The *Add Client* page opens.

. On the *Add Client* page, provide the required information to create a new client for your realm. For example:
* *Client ID*: `kie-remote`
* *Client protocol*: `openid-connect`

. Click *Save* to save your changes.

. Change the token settings in *Realm Settings*:
.. In the RH-SSO Admin Console, click the *Realm Settings* menu item.
.. Click the *Tokens* tab.
.. Change the value for *Access Token Lifespan* to [parameter]``15`` minutes.
+
This gives you enough time to get a token and invoke the service before it expires.

.. Click *Save* to save your changes.

. After a public client for your remote clients is created, you can now obtain the token by making an HTTP request to the RH-SSO server's token endpoint using:
+
[source,subs="attributes+"]
----
RESULT=`curl --data "grant_type=password&client_id=kie-remote&username=admin&password=password" http://localhost:8180/auth/realms/demo/protocol/openid-connect/token`
----
+
The user in this command is a {CENTRAL} RH-SSO user. For more information, see <<sso-user-add-proc>>.

. To view the token obtained from the RH-SSO server, use the following command:
+
[source,subs="attributes+"]
----
TOKEN=`echo $RESULT | sed 's/.*access_token":"//g' | sed 's/".*//g'`
----

You can now use this token to authorize the remote calls.
For example, if you want to check the internal {PRODUCT} repositories, use the token as shown below:

[source,subs="attributes+"]
----
curl -H "Authorization: bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8080/{URL_COMPONENT_CENTRAL}/rest/repositories
----
