= {KIE_SERVER} token-based authentication
You can also use token-based authentication for communication between {PRODUCT} and {KIE_SERVER}. You can use the complete token as a system property of your application server, instead of the user name and password, for your applications. However, you must ensure that the token will not expire while the applications are interacting because the token is not automatically refreshed. To get the token, see <<sso-token-auth-proc>>.

.Procedure
. To configure {CENTRAL} to manage {KIE_SERVER} using tokens:
.. Set the `org.kie.server.token` property.
.. Make sure that the `org.kie.server.user` and `org.kie.server.pwd` properties are not set.
+
{PRODUCT} will then use the `Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN` authentication method. 
+
. To use the REST API using the token-based authentication:
.. Set the `org.kie.server.controller.token` property.
.. Make sure that the `org.kie.server.controller.user` and `org.kie.server.controller.pwd` properties are not set.

[NOTE]
====
Because {KIE_SERVER} is unable to refresh the token, use a high-lifespan token. A token's lifespan must not exceed January 19 2038. Check with your security best practices to see whether this is a suitable solution for your environment.
