= Installing and configuring RH-SSO

A realm is a security policy domain defined for a web or application server. Security realms are used to restrict access for different application resources. You should create a new realm whether your RH-SSO instance is private or shared with other products. You can keep the master realm as a place for super administrators to create and manage the realms in your system. If you are integrating with an RH-SSO instance that is shared with other product installations to achieve single sign-on with those applications, all of those applications must use the same realm. To create an RH-SSO realm, download, install, and configure RH-SSO {RH-SSO_VERSION}.

[NOTE]
====
If {CENTRAL} and {KIE_SERVER} are installed on different servers, complete this procedure on both servers.

[NOTE]
====
If you want to run both RH-SSO and {PRODUCT} servers on the same system, ensure that you avoid port conflicts. by doing one of the following:

* Update the `_RHSSO_HOME_/standalone/configuration/standalone-full.xml` file and set a port offset to 100. For example:
+
[source]
----
<socket-binding-group name="standard-sockets" default-interface="public" port-offset="${jboss.socket.binding.port-offset:100}">
----

* Use an environment variable to run the server:
+
[source]
----
bin/standalone.sh -Djboss.socket.binding.port-offset=100
