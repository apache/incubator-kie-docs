= Creating the {KIE_SERVER} client on RH-SSO
Use the RH-SSO Admin Console to create a {KIE_SERVER} client in an existing realm.

.Prerequisites

* {KIE_SERVER} is installed in a {EAP} {EAP_VERSION} server, as described in {URL_INSTALLING_AND_CONFIGURING}#assembly-install-on-eap[_{INSTALLING_ON_EAP}_].
* RH-SSO is installed as described in <<sso-realm-proc>>.
* At least one user with the `kie-server` role has been added to RH-SSO as described in <<sso-user-add-proc>>.

.Procedure
. In the RH-SSO Admin Console, open the security realm that you created in <<sso-realm-proc>>.
. Click *Clients* and click *Create*.
+
The *Add Client* page opens.
+
. On the *Add Client* page, provide the required information to create a {KIE_SERVER} client for your realm, then click *Save*. For example:
+
* *Client ID*: `kie-execution-server`
* *Root URL*: `http://_localhost_:8080/kie-server`
* *Client protocol*: `openid-connect`
+
[NOTE]
====
If you are configuring RH-SSO with {OPENSHIFT}, enter the URL that is exposed by the {KIE_SERVER} routes. Your OpenShift administrator can provide this URL if necessary.
====
+
. The new client *Access Type* is set to `public` by default. Change it to `confidential` and click *Save* again.
. Navigate to the *Credentials* tab and copy the secret key. The secret key is required to configure the `kie-execution-server` client.
+
[NOTE]
====
The RH-SSO server client uses one URL to a single {KIE_SERVER} deployment. The following error message might be displayed if there are two or more deployment configurations:

We are sorry... `Invalid parameter: redirect_uri`

To resolve this error, append `/pass:[*]` to the *Valid Redirect URIs* field in the client configuration.

On the *Configure* page, go to *Clients* > *kie-execution-server* > *Settings*, and append the *Valid Redirect URIs* field with `/*`, for example:

----
http://localhost:8080/kie-server/*
