= Authenticating {KIE_SERVER} through RH-SSO

{KIE_SERVER} provides a REST API for third-party clients. If you integrate {KIE_SERVER} with RH-SSO, you can delegate third-party client identity management to the RH-SSO server.

After you create a realm client for {PRODUCT} and set up the RH-SSO client adapter for {EAP}, you can set up RH-SSO authentication for {KIE_SERVER}.

.Prerequisites
* RH-SSO is installed as described in <<sso-realm-proc>>.
* At least one user with the `kie-server` role has been added to RH-SSO as described in <<sso-user-add-proc>>.
* {KIE_SERVER} is installed in a {EAP} {EAP_VERSION} instance, as described in {URL_INSTALLING_ON_EAP}[_{INSTALLING_ON_EAP}_].

This chapter contains the following sections:

* <<sso-kie-server-client-proc>>
* <<sso-kie-server-client-adapter-proc>>
* <<sso-kie-server-token-proc>>

[NOTE]
====
Except for <<sso-kie-server-client-proc>>, this section is intended for standalone installations. If you are integrating RH-SSO and {PRODUCT} on {OPENSHIFT}, complete the steps in <<sso-kie-server-client-proc>> and then deploy the {PRODUCT} environment on {OPENSHIFT}. For information about deploying {PRODUCT} on {OPENSHIFT}, see the relevant document on the
