= Authenticating {KIE_SERVER} through RH-SSO

{KIE_SERVER} provides a REST API for third-party clients. If you integrate {KIE_SERVER} with RH-SSO, you can delegate third-party client identity management to the RH-SSO server.

After you have created a realm client for {PRODUCT} and set up the RH-SSO client adapter for {EAP}, you can set up RH-SSO authentication for {KIE_SERVER}.
