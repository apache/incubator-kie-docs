= Digital Experience Platform (DXP) and AppBuilder

Digital Experience Platform (DXP) is a low-code, component-based platform for building modern web, mobile, and IoT applications. AppBuilder is an application that provides features to help you configure and customize, with or without programming skills, any kind of modern web application built with AppBuilder. AppBuilder is a web-based administration console that you can use to build and configure your web application, manage your page data and activities, and integrate with other application tools, such as {PRODUCT}.

The basic components for building applications in AppBuilder are page models that define page layout and application widgets that define page data and functionality.

For more information about creating AppBuilder page models,pages and application widgets, see link:http://docs.entando.com/#getting-started-app-builder[_Getting Started with AppBuilder_].
