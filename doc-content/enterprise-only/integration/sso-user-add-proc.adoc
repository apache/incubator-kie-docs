= Adding {PRODUCT} users
Before you can use RH-SSO to authenticate {CENTRAL} or {KIE_SERVER}, you must add users to the realm that you created. To add new users and assign them a role to access {PRODUCT}, complete the following steps:

. Log in to the RH-SSO Admin Console and open the realm that you want to add a user to.
. Click the *Users* menu item under the *Manage* section.
+
An empty user list appears on the *Users* page.

. Click the *Add User* button on the empty user list to start creating your new user.
+
The *Add User* page opens.

. On the *Add User* page, enter the user information and click *Save*.
. Click the *Credentials* tab and create a password.
. Assign the new user one of the roles that allows access to {PRODUCT}. For example, assign the `admin` role to access {CENTRAL} or assign the `kie-server` role to access {KIE_SERVER}.
+
[NOTE]
====
For projects that deploy from {CENTRAL} on OpenShift, create an RH-SSO user called `mavenuser` without any role assigned, then add this user to the `BUSINESS_CENTRAL_MAVEN_USERNAME` and `BUSINESS_CENTRAL_MAVEN_PASSWORD` in your OpenShift template.
====
+
. Define the roles as realm roles in the *Realm Roles* tab under the *Roles* section.
+
Alternatively, for roles used in {CENTRAL}, you can define the roles as client roles for the `kie` client. For instructions about configuring the `kie` client, see <<sso-central-client-create-proc>>. To use client roles, you must also configure additional settings for {CENTRAL}, as described in <<sso-client-adapter-proc>>.
+
You must define roles used in {KIE_SERVER} as realm roles.
+
. Click the *Role Mappings* tab on the *Users* page to assign roles.
