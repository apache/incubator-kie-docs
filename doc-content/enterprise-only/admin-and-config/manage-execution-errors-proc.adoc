= Managing execution errors

By definition, every process error that is detected and stored is unacknowledged and must be handled by someone or something (in case of automatic error recovery). Errors are filtered on the basis of whether or not they have been acknowledged. Acknowledging an error saves the user information and time stamp for traceability. You can access the *Error Management* view at any time.

.Procedure
. In {CENTRAL}, go to *Menu* -> *Manage* -> *Execution Errors*.

. Click the *Acknowledge* button to acknowledge and clear the error. You can view the error later by selecting *Yes* on the *Acknowledged* filter in the *Manage Execution Errors* page.

. Click the *Go to Task* button, if applicable, to view the associated job information in the *Manage Tasks* page.
