= Standalone perspectives in {CENTRAL}

{CENTRAL} provides specialized editors for authoring assets based on the asset's format. {CENTRAL} has a feature that enables you to use these editors individually. This feature is known as the standalone perspective mode of the editor or simply the _standalone perspectives_.

As a business rules developer, you can embed a standalone perspective in your web application and then use it to edit rules, processes, decision tables, and other assets. After embedding a perspective you can edit an asset in your own application without switching to {CENTRAL}. You can use this feature to customize your web application. In addition to standalone perspectives you can also embed standalone custom pages (dashboards) in your applications.

You can access a standalone perspective by using a specific web address in a browser with the `standalone` and `perspective` parameters. A standalone perspective's web address may also contain additional parameters.
