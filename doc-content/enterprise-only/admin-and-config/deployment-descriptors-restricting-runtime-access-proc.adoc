[id='deployment-descriptors-restricting-runtime-access-proc']
= Restricting access to the runtime engine

The `required-roles` configuration item can be edited in the deployment descriptors. This property restricts access to the runtime engine on a per-KJAR or per-server level by ensuring that access to certain processes is only granted to users that belong to groups defined by this property.

The security role can be used to restrict access to process definitions or restrict access at run time.

The default behavior is to add required roles to this property based on repository restrictions.
You can edit these properties manually if required by providing roles that match actual roles defined in the security realm.
