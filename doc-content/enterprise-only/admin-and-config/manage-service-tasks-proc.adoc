= Managing service tasks in {CENTRAL}

Service tasks (work items) are tasks that you can customize and reuse across multiple business processes or across all projects in {CENTRAL}. {PRODUCT} provides a set of service tasks within the service task repository in {CENTRAL}. You can enable or disable the default service tasks and upload custom service tasks into {CENTRAL} to implement the tasks in the relevant processes.

.Procedure
. In {CENTRAL}, select the *Admin* icon in the top-right corner of the screen and select *Service Tasks Administration*.
+
This page lists the service task installation settings and available service tasks for processes in projects throughout {CENTRAL}. The service tasks that you enable on this page become available in the project-level settings where you can then install each service task to be used in processes. The way in which the service tasks are installed in a project is determined by the global settings that you enable or disable under *Settings* on this *Service Tasks Administration* page.
. Under *Settings*, enable or disable each setting to determine how the available service tasks will be implemented when a user installs them at the project level.

--
The following service task settings are available:

* *Install as Maven artifact*: Uploads the service task JAR file to the Maven repository that is configured with {CENTRAL}, if the file is not already present.
* *Install service task dependencies into project*: Adds any service task dependencies to the `pom.xml` file of the project where the task is installed.
* *Use version range when installing service task into project*: Uses a version range instead of a fixed version of a service task that is added as a project dependency. Example: `[7.16,)` instead of `7.16.0.Final`
--
. Enable or disable (set to *ON* or *OFF*) any available service tasks as needed. Service tasks that you enable will be displayed in project-level settings for all projects in {CENTRAL}.

.Enable service tasks and service task settings

. To add a custom service task, click *Add Service Task*, browse to the relevant JAR file, and click the *Upload* icon. The JAR file must contain work item handler implementations annotated with `@Wid`.
. After you configure all required service tasks, navigate to a project in {CENTRAL} and go to project *Settings* -> *Service Tasks* to view the available service tasks that you enabled.
. For each service task, click *Install* to make the task available to the processes in that project or click *Uninstall* to exclude the task from the processes in the project.
. If you are prompted for additional information when you install a service task, enter also the required parameters for the service task and click *Install* again.

The required parameters for the service task depend on the type of task. For example, rule and decision tasks require artifact GAV information (Group ID, Artifact ID, Version), email tasks require host and port access information, and REST tasks require API credentials. Other service tasks might not require any additional parameters.
