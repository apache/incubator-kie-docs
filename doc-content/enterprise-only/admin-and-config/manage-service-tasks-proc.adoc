= Managing custom tasks in {CENTRAL}

Custom tasks (work items) are tasks that you can customize and reuse across multiple business processes or across all projects in {CENTRAL}. {PRODUCT} provides a set of custom tasks within the custom task repository in {CENTRAL}. You can enable or disable the default custom tasks and upload custom tasks into {CENTRAL} to implement the tasks in the relevant processes.

NOTE: {PRODUCT} includes a limited set of supported custom tasks. Custom tasks that are not included in {PRODUCT} are not supported.

.Procedure
. In {CENTRAL}, click image:project-data/gear-icon.png[] in the upper-right corner and select *Custom Tasks Administration*.
+
This page lists the custom task installation settings and available custom tasks for processes in projects throughout {CENTRAL}. The custom tasks that you enable on this page become available in the project-level settings where you can then install each custom task to be used in processes. The way in which the custom tasks are installed in a project is determined by the global settings that you enable or disable under *Settings* on this *Custom Tasks Administration* page.
. Under *Settings*, enable or disable each setting to determine how the available custom tasks are implemented when a user installs them at the project level.

--
The following custom task settings are available:

* *Install as Maven artifact*: Uploads the custom task JAR file to the Maven repository that is configured with {CENTRAL}, if the file is not already present.
* *Install custom task dependencies into project*: Adds any custom task dependencies to the `pom.xml` file of the project where the task is installed.
* *Use version range when installing custom task into project*: Uses a version range instead of a fixed version of a custom task that is added as a project dependency. Example: `[7.16,)` instead of `7.16.0.Final`
--
. Enable or disable (set to *ON* or *OFF*) any available custom tasks as needed. Custom tasks that you enable are displayed in project-level settings for all projects in {CENTRAL}.

.Enable custom tasks and custom task settings

. To add a custom task, click *Add Custom Task*, browse to the relevant JAR file, and click the *Upload* icon. The JAR file must contain work item handler implementations annotated with `@Wid`.
. Optionally, to remove a custom task, click *remove* on the row of the custom task you want to remove and click *Ok* to confirm removal.
. After you configure all required custom tasks, navigate to a project in {CENTRAL} and go to the project *Settings* -> *Custom Tasks* page to view the available custom tasks that you enabled.
. For each custom task, click *Install* to make the task available to the processes in that project or click *Uninstall* to exclude the task from the processes in the project.
. If you are prompted for additional information when you install a custom task, enter the required information and click *Install* again.

--
The required parameters for the custom task depend on the type of task. For example, rule and decision tasks require artifact GAV information (Group ID, Artifact ID, Version), email tasks require host and port access information, and REST tasks require API credentials. Other custom tasks might not require any additional parameters.
