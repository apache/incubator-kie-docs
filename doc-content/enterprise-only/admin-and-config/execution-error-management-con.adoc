= Execution error management

When an execution error occurs for a business process, the process stops and reverts to the most recent stable state (the closest safe point) and continues its execution. If an error of any kind is not handled by the process the entire transaction rolls back, leaving the process instance in the previous wait state. Execution errors are visible to the caller that sent the request to the {PROCESS_ENGINE}.

Users with process administrator (`process-admin`) or administrator (`admin`) roles can access execution error messages in {CENTRAL}. Execution error messaging provides the following primary benefits:

* Better traceability
* Visibility in case of critical processes
* Reporting and analytics based on error situations
* External system error handling and compensation
