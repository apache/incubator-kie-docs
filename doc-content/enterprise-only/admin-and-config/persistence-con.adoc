= Persistence

Binary persistence, or marshaling, converts the state of the process instance into a binary data set. Binary persistence is a mechanism used to store and retrieve information persistently. The same mechanism is also applied to the session state and work item states.

When you enable persistence of a process instance:

* {PRODUCT} transforms the process instance information into binary data. Custom serialization is used instead of Java serialization for performance reasons.
* The binary data is stored together with other process instance metadata, such as process instance ID, process ID, and the process start date.

The session can also store other forms of state, such as the state of timer jobs, or data required for business rules evaluation. Session state is stored separately as a binary data set along with the ID of the session and metadata. You can restore the session state by reloading a session with given ID. Use `ksession.getId()` to get the session ID.

{PRODUCT} will persist the following when persistence is configured:

* _Session state_: This includes the session ID, date of last modification, the session data that business rules would need for evaluation, state of timer jobs.
* _Process instance state_: This includes the process instance ID, process ID, date of last modification, date of last read access, process instance start date, runtime data (the execution status including the node being executed, variable values, and other process instance data) and the event types.
* _Work item runtime state_: This includes the work item ID, creation date, name, process instance ID, and the work item state itself.

Based on the persisted data, you can restore the state of execution of all running process instances in case of failure or to temporarily remove running instances from memory and restore them later.
