{PRODUCT} manages the required maintenance, runtime data that is removed, including:

* *Process instance data*, which is removed upon process instance completion.
* *Work item data*, which is removed upon work item completion.
* *Task instance data*, which is removed upon completion of a process to which the given task belongs.

Runtime data, which is not cleaned automatically includes session information data that is based on the selected runtime strategy.

* *Singleton strategy* ensures that runtime data of session information is not automatically removed.
* *Per request strategy* allows automatic removal when a request is terminated.
* *Per process instances* are automatically removed when a process instance is mapped to a session that is completed or aborted.

In order to keep the track of process instances, {PRODUCT} provides audit data tables. There are two ways to manage and maintain the audit data tables, including cleaning up the jobs <<setup-auto-cleanup-proc, automatically>> and <<manual-cleanup-con, manually>>.
