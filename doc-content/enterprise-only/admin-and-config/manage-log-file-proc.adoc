= Managing log data

{PRODUCT} manages the required maintenance runtime data. It removes some data automatically, including the following data types:

* *Process instance data*, which is removed upon process instance completion.
* *Work item data*, which is removed upon work item completion.
* *Task instance data*, which is removed upon completion of a process to which the given task belongs.

Runtime data that is not cleaned automatically includes session information data that is based on the selected runtime strategy.

* *Singleton strategy* ensures that runtime data of session information is not automatically removed.
* *Per request strategy* allows automatic removal when a request is terminated.
* *Per process instances* automatically removes process instance data when a process instance is mapped to a session that is completed or aborted.

{PRODUCT} also provides audit log data tables. You can use these tables to keep track of current and past process instances. By default, {PRODUCT} does not remove any data from audit log tables.

There are three ways to manage and maintain the audit data tables:

* You can set up an automatic cleanup of these tables using {CENTRAL}, as described in xref:setup-auto-cleanup-proc_{context}[].
* You can remove information from the tables manually using the Java API, as described in xref:manual-cleanup-con_{context}[].
* You can run a custom query on the {PRODUCT} database, including the audit log tables, as described in xref:custom-query-proc_{context}[].
