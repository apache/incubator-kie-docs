= Configuring an external Maven repository for {CENTRAL} and {KIE_SERVER}

You can configure {CENTRAL} and {KIE_SERVER} to use an external Maven repository, such as Nexus or Artifactory, instead of the built-in repository. This enables {CENTRAL} and {KIE_SERVER} to access and download artifacts that are maintained in the external Maven repository.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Artifacts in the repository do not receive automated security patches because Maven requires that artifacts be immutable. As a result, artifacts that are missing patches for known security flaws will remain in the repository to avoid breaking builds that depend on them. The version numbers of patched artifacts are incremented. For more information, see https://access.redhat.com/maven-repository[JBoss Enterprise Maven Repository].

[NOTE]
====
For information about configuring an external Maven repository for an authoring environment on {OPENSHIFT}, see the following documents:

* {URL_DEPLOYING_ON_OPENSHIFT}#operator-deploy-central-proc_openshift-operator[_{DEPLOYING_OPENSHIFT_OPERATOR}_]
* {URL_DEPLOYING_ON_OPENSHIFT}#assembly-openshift-templates[_{DEPLOYING_OPENSHIFT_TEMPLATES}_]

.Prerequisites
* {CENTRAL} and {KIE_SERVER} are installed. For installation options, see {URL_INSTALLING_AND_CONFIGURING}#assembly-planning[_{PLANNING_INSTALL}_].

.Procedure
. Create a Maven `settings.xml` file with connection and access details for your external repository. For details about the `settings.xml` file, see the Maven link:https://maven.apache.org/settings.html[Settings Reference].
. Save the file in a known location, for example, `/opt/custom-config/settings.xml`.
. In your {PRODUCT_PAM} installation directory, navigate to the `standalone-full.xml` file. For example, if you use a {EAP} installation for {PRODUCT_PAM} go to `$EAP_HOME/standalone/configuration/standalone-full.xml`.
. Open `standalone-full.xml` and under the `<system-properties>` tag, set the `kie.maven.settings.custom` property to the full path name of the `settings.xml` file.

For example:

[source,xml]
----
<property name="kie.maven.settings.custom" value="/opt/custom-config/settings.xml"/>
----

. Start or restart {CENTRAL} and {KIE_SERVER}.

.Next steps
For each {CENTRAL} project that you want to export or push as a KJAR artifact to the external Maven repository, you must add the repository information in the project `pom.xml` file. For instructions, see
