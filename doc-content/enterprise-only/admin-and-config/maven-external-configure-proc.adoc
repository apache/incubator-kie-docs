You can configure {CENTRAL} and {KIE_SERVER} to use an external Maven repository, such as Nexus or Artifactory, instead of the built-in repository. In this case, when you build projects in {CENTRAL}, all built project KJAR files are pushed into this external repository. You can progress these files through the repository as necessary to implement your integration process, and deploy the KJAR files using {CENTRAL} or the {KIE_SERVER} REST API.

.Prerequisite
{CENTRAL} and {KIE_SERVER} are installed. For installation options, see {URL_PLANNING_INSTALL}[_{PLANNING_INSTALL}_].

.Procedure
. Create a Maven `settings.xml` file with connection and access details for your external repository. For details about the `settings.xml` file, see the Maven link:https://maven.apache.org/settings.html[Settings Reference].
. Save the file in a known location, for example, `/opt/custom-config/settings.xml`.
. In your {PRODUCT} installation directory, navigate to the `standalone-full.xml` file. For example, if you use a {EAP} installation for {PRODUCT}, go to `$EAP_HOME/standalone/configuration/standalone-full.xml`.
. Open `standalone-full.xml` and under the `<system-properties>` tag, set the `kie.maven.settings.custom` property to the full path name of the `settings.xml` file.
+
For example:
+
[source,xml]
----
<property name="kie.maven.settings.custom" value="/opt/custom-config/settings.xml"/>
----
+
. Start or restart {CENTRAL} and {KIE_SERVER}.
