= Managing data sources

{CENTRAL} provides data source management which gives you the ability of defining data sources for accessing a database. These data sources are then used by other {CENTRAL} components such as the data sets. A database driver, on the other hand, is used for enabling communication between a data source and the targeted database.

From the *Data Source Authoring* page you can add data sources and database drivers to {CENTRAL}.

[NOTE]
====
{CENTRAL} provides a default data source that can can be used but can neither be edited nor deleted.
