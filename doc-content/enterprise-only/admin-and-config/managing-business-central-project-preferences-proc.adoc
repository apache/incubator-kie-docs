= Customizing project preferences

A project stores assets and is part of a space. A space can hold multiple projects.

For example, an organization has many departments, such as HR, Payroll, Engineering, R&D, and so on. All these departments map to spaces. Every department can have one or more processes that map to projects running at the same time.

You can create a new Project from scratch or clone projects from an existing Git repository.
