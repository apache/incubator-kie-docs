= Customizing project preferences

*Projects* are virtual storage places used for storing assets. In {CENTRAL}, projects are a subset of spaces. In other words, spaces model the domain which can have n number of projects. A space can hold multiple projects whereas a project is a part of a single space only.

For example, an organization has many departments, such as, HR, Payroll, Engineering, R&D and so on. All these departments map to Spaces in {CENTRAL}. Now every department can have one or more processes running at a given point of time. These processes would map to Projects in {CENTRAL}.

You can create a new Project from scratch or clone them from an existing repository.
