= Customizing project preferences

A project stores assets and is part of a space. A space can hold multiple projects.

For example, an organization has many departments, such as HR, Payroll, Engineering, R&D, and so on. Each department maps to a space and every department can have its own projects.

You can create a new project from scratch or clone projects from an existing Git repository.
