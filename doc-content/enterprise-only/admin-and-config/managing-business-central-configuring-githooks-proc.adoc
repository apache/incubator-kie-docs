= Configuring git hooks

{CENTRAL} can automatically push changes to a remote repository using Git hooks. After you configure the post-commit hook, {CENTRAL} automatically pushes your changes to the remote repository.

[NOTE]
====
Currently only post-commit hooks are supported. Post-commit hooks are triggered after the commit process finishes.
====

.Prerequisites
* {PRODUCT} projects exist in an external Git repository.
* Credentials required for read access to that external Git repository are available.

.Procedure

. Log in to {CENTRAL}.
. Select *Menu* -> *Projects*.
. Select or create the space into which you want to import the projects.
. Click image:project-data/dots.png[] on the right side of the screen and select *Import Project*.
. In the *Import Project* window, enter the URL (for example, `\https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY_NAME.git`) and credentials for the Git repository that contains the project that you want to import and click *Import*.
+
The project is added to the {CENTRAL} Git repository and is available in the created or default space.
+
[IMPORTANT]
=====
Use the HTTPS or Git protocol instead of a SCP-style SSH URL. {CENTRAL} does not support the basic SSH URL and an error appears if you use this URL.
=====

. In a terminal window, change to the created repository.
+
[source]
----
cd JBOSS_HOME/bin/.niogit/REPOSITORY_NAME.git
----

. Create the `post-commit` file in the `JBOSS_HOME/bin/.niogit/REPOSITORY_NAME.git/hooks` directory, set the permissions to `rwxr--r--` and add the following content:
+
[source]
----
#!/bin/sh
git push origin master
----

. Make sure that the configuration was successful by creating a new guided rule in {CENTRAL}:

.. Select *Menu* -> *Projects* -> *Add Asset* -> *Guided Rule*.
.. Fill in the required information in the displayed *Create new Guided Rule* window.
.. Click *Ok*.
+
{CENTRAL} automatically pushes all changes to the remote repository.

You can also specify the `org.uberfire.nio.git.hooks` system property. Specify a directory with default hook files as the value for this property. This directory will be copied to the newly created Git repositories. See the following example of a `standalone.xml` file with this setting below:

[source]
----
<system-properties>
  <property name="org.uberfire.nio.git.hooks" value="/opt/jboss-as/git-hooks">
  </property>
  ...
</system-properties>
----

= Customizing git hook notifications
The platform provides a mechanism to enable users getting feedback about the git hooks execution using customized
messages based on the hook ``exit code``.

To enable the notification mechanism you should specify the `appformer.git.hooks.bundle` system property pointing to a
`*.properties` file containing the custom messages for each `exit code`. For example adding it to the `standalone.xml`:

[source]
----
<system-properties>
  <property name="appformer.git.hooks.bundle" value="/opt/jboss-as/git-hooks-messages/Messages.properties">
  </property>
  ...
</system-properties>
----

Each line of the  `*.properties` should have the following format `<exit code>=<display message>. Where `<exit code>` is
the git hook exit code and `<display message>` is the text of the message to display on the notification.

For example:

[source]
----
0=Success! Nothing wrong happened and the git hook worked as expected :)
1=Oops! Something went wrong, check the logs and tell your admin.
...
31=Ouch! Something went REALLY WRONG! Please run and tell your admin.
----

[NOTE]
====
Its not necessary to define all the exit codes in the `*.properties` file. Notifications will appear only for the exit
codes defined in the `*.properties`.
====

== Types of exit codes

The platform provides some ranges of codes that can be used to show different notification types on the UI:

* `0`: Success. A git hook that exits with code `0` will display a success notification on UI.

.Successful notification
image::admin-and-config/githooks/Error.png[align="center"]

* `1..30`: Warning. A git hook that exits with a code between `1` and `30` (included) will display a warning notification
on UI.

.Warning notification
image::admin-and-config/githooks/Warning.png[align="center"]

* Anything else: Error. Any other code will be displayed on UI as an error notification.

.Error notification
image::admin-and-config/githooks/Success.png[align="center"]

[IMPORTANT]
====
*UNIX* machines only support error codes between 0 (success) to 255 (error), any exit code outside of this range will
end up being converted into a different code which may cause showing a wrong notification message.

*Windows* machines don't have this limitation and support a wide range of exit codes.
====

== Internationalization support
It is possible to internationalize the notification messages by placing different `*.properties` on the same path as the
`*.properties` file specified on the `appformer.git.hooks.bundle` system property. The name of the different localized
files should be `<filename>_<lang>.properties`, and it should contain the same entries as the original one. For example:
having specified the system property pointing to `Messages.properties`, you can create other files like
`Messages_en.properties" for English, `Messages_fr.properties` for French, `Messages_it.properties` for Italian...

The notification service will choose the one based on the user language, if there are no available translations
for that language it will use the default ones specified on the `Messages.properties` file.
