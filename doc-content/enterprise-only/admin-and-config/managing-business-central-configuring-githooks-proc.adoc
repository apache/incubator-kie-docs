= Configuring git hooks

{CENTRAL} can automatically push changes to a remote repository using Git hooks. After you configure the post-commit hook, {CENTRAL} automatically pushes your changes to the remote repository.

[NOTE]
====
Currently only post-commit hooks are supported. Post-commit hooks are triggered after the commit process finishes.
====

.Prerequisites
* {PRODUCT} projects exist in an external Git repository.
* Credentials required for read access to that external Git repository are available.

.Procedure

. Log in to {CENTRAL}.
. Go to *Menu* -> *Projects*.
. Select or create the space into which you want to import the projects.
. Click image:project-data/dots.png[] on the right side of the screen and select *Import Project*.
. . In the *Import Project* window, enter the URL (for example, `https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY_NAME.git`) and credentials for the Git repository that contains the project that you want to import and click *Import*.
+
The project is added to the {CENTRAL} Git repository and is available in the created or default space.
+
[IMPORTANT]
=====
Use the HTTPS or Git protocol instead of a SCP-style SSH URL. {CENTRAL} does not support the basic SSH URL and an error appears if you use this URL.
=====

. In a terminal window, change to the created repository.
+
[source]
----
cd JBOSS_HOME/bin/.niogit/REPOSITORY_NAME.git
----

. Create the `post-commit` file in the `JBOSS_HOME/bin/.niogit/REPOSITORY_NAME.git/hooks` directory, set the permissions to `rwxr--r--` and add the following content:
+
[source]
----
#!/bin/sh
git push origin master
----

. Make sure that the configuration was successful by creating a new guided rule in {CENTRAL}:

.. Go to *Menu* -> *Projects* -> *Add Asset* -> *Guided Rule*.
.. Fill in the required information in the displayed *Create new Guided Rule* window.
.. Click *Ok*.
+
{CENTRAL} automatically pushes all changes to the remote repository.

You can also specify the `org.uberfire.nio.git.hooks` system property. Specify a directory with default hook files as the value for this property. This directory will be copied to the newly created Git repositories. See the following example of a `standalone.xml` file with this setting below:

[source]
----
<system-properties>
  <property name="org.uberfire.nio.git.hooks" value="/opt/jboss-as/git-hooks">
  </property>
  ...
</system-properties>
