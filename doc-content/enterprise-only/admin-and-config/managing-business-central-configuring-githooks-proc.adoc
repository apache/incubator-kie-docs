= Configuring Git hooks

You can use {CENTRAL} to automatically push changes to a remote repository using Git hooks by configuring the post-commit hook.

[NOTE]
====
Currently only post-commit hooks are supported. Post-commit hooks are triggered after the commit process finishes.
====

.Prerequisites
* {Product} is installed in a {EAP} {EAP_VERSION} server instance.
* {PRODUCT} projects exist in an external Git repository.
* Read access credentials for the external Git repository.
* (For Windows) Cygwin is installed with the Git package added during installation and the path to the Cygwin `/bin` folder is added to your environment `PATH` variable. For example, `C:\cygwin64\bin`. For more information about Cygwin installation, see http://www.cygwin.com/install.html[Installing and Updating Cygwin Packages].

.Procedure
. In {CENTRAL}, go to *Menu* -> *Projects*.
. Select or create the space that you want to import the Git projects into.
. Click image:project-data/dots.png[] on the right side of the screen and select *Import Project*.
. In the *Import Project* window, enter the URL of your Git repository, for example, `https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY_NAME.git`, and the credentials for the Git repository.
. Click *Import*.
+
The project is added to the {CENTRAL} Git repository and is then available in the space.
+
[IMPORTANT]
=====
Use the HTTPS or Git protocol instead of a SCP-style SSH URL. {CENTRAL} does not support the basic SSH URL and an error appears if you use this URL.

You must have your public ssh key configured in your Git provider.

The Git repository must be a KJAR project, containing only a single KJAR that is compatible with the {PRODUCT} version. The KJAR content must be in the root of the repository.
=====

. In a command terminal, navigate to the repository folder:
+
[source]
----
cd JBOSS_HOME/bin/.niogit/<SPACE>/REPOSITORY_NAME.git
----

. Create a `post-commit` file  in a `hooks` folder with permissions set to `rwxr--r--`. For example, `JBOSS_HOME/bin/.niogit/<SPACE>/REPOSITORY_NAME.git/hooks/post-commit`.

. Add the following content to the `post-commit` file:
+
[source]
----
#!/bin/sh
git push origin +master
----

. To check that the configuration was successful, create a guided rule in {CENTRAL}:

.. In {CENTRAL} go to *Menu* -> *Projects* -> *Add Asset* -> *Guided Rule*.
.. On the *Create new Guided Rule* page, enter the required information.
.. Click *Ok*.
+
{CENTRAL} automatically pushes all changes to the remote repository.

You can specify a directory with the hook file for the value of the `org.uberfire.nio.git.hooks` system property. This directory is copied to the newly created Git repositories. See the following example of a `standalone.xml` file with this setting:

[source]
----
<system-properties>
  <property name="org.uberfire.nio.git.hooks" value="/opt/jboss-as/git-hooks">
  </property>
  ...
</system-properties>
