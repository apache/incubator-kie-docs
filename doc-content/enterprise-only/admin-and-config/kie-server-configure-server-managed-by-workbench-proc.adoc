= Configuring {KIE_SERVER} Managed by {CENTRAL}

WARNING: This section provides a sample setup that you can use for testing purposes. Some of the values are unsuitable for a production environment, and are marked as such.

Use this procedure to configure {CENTRAL} to manage {A_KIE_SERVER} instance.

.Prerequisites
* Users with the following roles exist:
** In {CENTRAL}, a user with the role `rest-all`
** On the {KIE_SERVER}, a user with the role `kie-server`

NOTE: In production environments, use two distinct users, each with one role. In this sample situation, we use only one user named `controllerUser` that has both the `rest-all` and the `kie-server` roles.

.Procedure
. Set the following JVM properties.
+
The location of {CENTRAL} and the {KIE_SERVER} may be different. In such case, ensure you set the properties on the correct server instances.

*** `_EAP_HOME_/standalone/configuration/standalone*.xml` for standalone mode.
*** `_EAP_HOME_/domain/configuration/domain.xml` for domain mode.
