= Process administration

You can define the number of items to be displayed by default for all users in the _Manage_ and _Task Inbox_ sections. In the _Manage_ section, this applies to the process definitions, process instances, tasks, jobs, and execution errors. You can set the default pagination using the *Process Administration* option on the {CENTRAL} *Settings* page. After a new default is applied, it is effective for all users who do not have a custom preference saved for these items.
