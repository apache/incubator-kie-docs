Users can define the number of items to be displayed by default for all users under *Manage* (process definitions, process instances, tasks, jobs, and execution errors) and *Task Inbox* sections. You can set the default pagination using *Process Administration* option from the *Admin* settings page in {CENTRAL} and once a new default is applied it is effective for all users who do not have a custom preference saved for these items.
