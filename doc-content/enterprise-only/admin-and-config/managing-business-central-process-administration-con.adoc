= Process administration

You can define the number of items to be displayed by default for all users in the _Manage_ (process definitions, process instances, tasks, jobs, and execution errors) and _Task Inbox_ sections. You can set the default pagination using the *Process Administration* option from the *Admin* settings page in {CENTRAL}. After a new default is applied, it is effective for all users who do not have a custom preference saved for these items.
