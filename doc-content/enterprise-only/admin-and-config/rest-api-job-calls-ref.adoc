= Job calls

Most Knowledge Store REST calls return a job ID after they are issued. This is necessary as the calls are asynchronous and it is required to be able to reference the job later to check its status as it goes through a job life cycle.

During its life cycle, a job can have the following statuses:

.Job Statuses
[cols="1,3a", frame="all", options="header"]
|===
|Status
|Description

|`ACCEPTED`
|The job was accepted and is being processed.

|`BAD_REQUEST`
|The request was not accepted as it contained incorrect content.

|`RESOURCE_NOT_EXIST`
|The requested resource (path) does not exist.

|`DUPLICATE_RESOURCE`
|The resource already exists.

|`SERVER_ERROR`
|An error on the server side occurred.

|`SUCCESS`
|The job finished successfully.

|`FAIL`
|The job failed.

|`APPROVED`
|The job was approved.

|`DENIED`
|The job was denied.

|`GONE`
|The job ID could not be found. A job can be `GONE` in the following cases:

* The job was explicitly removed.
* The job finished and has been deleted from a status cache. A job is removed from a status cache after the cache has reached its maximum capacity.
* The job never existed.
|===

The following job calls are provided:

[GET] /jobs/_JOB_ID_::
Returns a status of the given `_JOB_ID_`.

{
  "status" : "SUCCESS",
  "jobId" : "1377770574783-27",
  "result" : "Alias: testInstallAndDeployProject, Scheme: git, Uri: git://testInstallAndDeployProject",
  "lastModified" : 1377770578194,
  "detailedResult" : null
}
----

[DELETE] /jobs/_JOB_ID_::
Removes a job with the given `_JOB_ID_`. If the job is not being processed yet, the call will remove the job from the job queue. However, this call will not cancel or stop an ongoing job.

Both of these job calls return a `JobResult` instance.
