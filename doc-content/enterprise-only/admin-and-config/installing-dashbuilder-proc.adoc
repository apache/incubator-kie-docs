//Need more instructions here. How do I start Dashbuilder Runtimes? What steps come before this one:

. If promted, upload a dashboard. If no static dashboards are configured then Dashbuilder Runtime prompts you to upload a dashboard. When the dashboard is uploaded the runtime will use that dashboard until the runtime is restarted.
//What if I'm not prompted? How do I upload a dashboard.

Navigation between the pages of a dashboard in Dashboard Runtime is identical to navigation in the {CENTRAL} where the dashboard was created. If a page belongs to a group, that group is imported to Dashbuilder Runtime as well as the page. If a page is not in the navigation tree then the page is added to the *Dashboards* menu group. If there is no navigation exported then all pages are added to the *Dashboards* menu group.
//This is a litte unclear.
