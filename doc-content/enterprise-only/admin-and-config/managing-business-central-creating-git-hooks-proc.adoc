= Creating post-commit Git hooks

You can create a post-commit Git hook bash script file that executes code contained in that file or execute code from a different file such as a Java program.

.Procedure
. Create a `post-commit` Git hook file:
+
[source]
----
$ touch post-commit
----
. Set the permissions of the `post-commit` file to `755`:
+
[source]
----
$ chmod 755 post-commit
----
. Add `#!/bin/bash` and any required code to the `post-commit` file, for example:
+
* To push all changes to a remote repository:
+
[source]
----
#!/bin/bash
git push origin +master
----
* To log a message:
+
[source]
----
#!/bin/bash
echo 'Hello World'
----
* To execute code of another file:
+
[source]
----
#!/bin/bash
java -jar _EAP_HOME_/bin/.niogit/<SPACE>/<PROJECT_NAME>.git/hooks/git-push.jar
----
+
[NOTE]
====
To use post-commit Git hooks that execute Java code, you must use the following Java libraries:

* https://www.eclipse.org/jgit/[JGit]: Used to interact with internal {CENTRAL} Git repositories.
* http://github-api.kohsuke.org/[GitHub API for Java]: Used to communicate with GitHub.
