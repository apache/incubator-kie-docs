[id='role-based-access']
= Role-based access control for branches in {CENTRAL}
{CENTRAL} provides the option for users to restrict the access for a target branch for a specific collaborator type. The security check uses both the *Security Management* screen and contributors sources to grant or deny permissions to spaces and  projects. For example, if a user has the security permission to update a project and has write permission on that branch, based on the contributor type, then they are able to create new assets.
