= Work item definitions

{PRODUCT} requires a work item definition (WID) file to identify the data fields to show in {CENTRAL} and accept API calls. The WID file is a mapping between user interactions with {PRODUCT} and the data that is passed to the work item handler. The WID file also handles the UI details such as the name of the custom task, the category it is displayed as on the palette in {CENTRAL}, the icon used to designate the custom task, and the work item handler the custom task will map to.

In {PRODUCT}  you can create a WID file in two ways:

* Use a `@Wid` annotation when coding the work item handler.
* Create a `.wid` text file. For example, `definitions-example.wid`.

== @Wid Annotation
The `@Wid` annotation is automatically created when you generate a work item handler project using the Maven archetype. You can also add the annotation manually.

|===
|
|Description
|`@Wid`
|Top-level annotation to auto-generate WID files.
|`widfile`
|Name of the file that is automatically created for the custom task when it is deployed in {PRODUCT}.
|`name`
|Name of the custom task, used internally. This name must be unique to custom tasks deployed in {PRODUCT}.
|`displayName`
|Displayed name of the custom task. This name is displayed in the palette in {CENTRAL}.
|`icon`
|Path from `src/main/resources/` to an icon located in the current project. The icon is displayed in the palette in {CENTRAL}. The icon, if specified, must be a PNG or GIF file and 16x16 pixels. This value can be left blank to use a default “Service Task” icon.
|`description`
|Description of the custom task.
|`defaultHandler`
|The work item handler Java class that is linked to the custom task. This entry is in the format `<language> : <class>`. {PRODUCT} recommends using `mvel` as the language value for this attribute but `java` can also be used. For more information about mvel, see http://mvel.documentnode.com/[MVEL Documentation].
|`documentation`
|Path to an HTML file in the current project that contains a description of the custom task.
|`@WidParameter`
|Child annotation of `@Wid`. Specifies values that will be populated in the {CENTRAL} GUI or expected by API calls as data inputs for the custom task. More than one parameter can be specified:

`name` - A name for the parameter.

NOTE: Due to the possibility of this name being used in API calls over transfer methods such as REST or SOAP, this name should not contain spaces or special characters.

`required` - Boolean value indicating whether the parameter is required for the custom task to execute.

|`@WidResult`
|Child annotation of `@Wid`. Specifies values that will be populated in the {CENTRAL} GUI or expected by API calls as data outputs for the custom task. You can specify more than one result:

`name` - A name for the result.

NOTE: Due to the possibility of this name being used in API calls over transfer methods such as REST or SOAP, this name should not contain spaces or special characters.

`@WidMavenDepends` - Child annotation of `@Wid`. Specifies Maven dependencies that will be required for the correct functioning of the work item handler. You can specify more than one dependency:

`group` - Maven group ID of the dependency.

`artifact` - Maven artifact ID of the dependency.

`version` - Maven version number of the dependency.
|`@WidService`
|Child annotation of `@Wid`. Specifies values that will be populated in the service repository.

`category` - The UI palette category that the handler will be placed. This value should match the `category` field of the `@Wid` annotation.

`description` - Description of the handler that will be displayed in the service repository.

`keywords` - Comma-separated list of keywords that apply to the handler. Note: Currently not used by the {CENTRAL} service repository.

`action` - The `@WidAction` object. Contains the fields `title` and `description`.

`authinfo` - The `@WidAuth` object. Optional. Contains the fields `required`, `params`, `paramsdescription`, `referencesite`.
|`@WidAction`
|Object of `@WidService` that describes the handler purpose.

`title` - The title for the handler action.

`description` - The description for the handler action.
|`@WidAuth`
|Object of `@WidService` that defines the authentication required by the handler.

`required` - The boolean value that determines whether authentication is required.

`params` - The array containing the authentication parameters required.

`paramsdescription` - The array containing the descriptions for each authentication parameter.

`referencesite` - The URL to where the handler documentation can be found. Note: Currently not used by the {CENTRAL} service repository.

== Text File
A global `WorkDefinitions` WID text file is automatically generated by new projects when a business process is added. The WID text file is similar to the JSON format but is not a completely valid JSON file. You can open this file in {CENTRAL}. You can create additional WID files by selecting *Add Asset* > *Work item definitions* from an existing project.

The file is structured as a plain-text file using a JSON-like structure. The filename extension is `.wid`.

{PRODUCT} tries to locate a `*.wid` file in two locations by default:

* Within {CENTRAL} in the project's top-level `global/` directory. This is the location of the default `WorkDefinitions.wid` file that is created automatically when a project first adds a business process asset.
* Within {CENTRAL} in the project's `src/main/resources/` directory. This is where WID files created within a project in {CENTRAL} will be placed. A WID file may be created at any level of a Java package, so a WID file created at a package location of `<default>` will be created directly inside `src/main/resources/` while a WID file created at a package location of `com.redhat` will be created at `src/main/resources/com/redhat/`

WARNING: {PRODUCT} does not validate that the value for the `defaultHandler` tag is executable or is a valid Java class. Specifying incorrect or invalid classes for this tag will return errors.
