= User management

{CENTRAL} defines three types of entities for security management - users, groups, and roles. Permissions can be assigned to both roles and groups. {CENTRAL} provides the following roles:

* process-admin
* manager
* admin
* analyst
* developer
* user

[NOTE]
====
If a role's identifier is present in the application's Role Registry only then it is considered a role otherwise its a group.
====

You can use {CENTRAL} to create and manage as many users and groups as you require. A user must be assigned at least one user-specific role to login to {CENTRAL}. User privileges depends on permissions from the groups and roles the user is a member of. Note that role or group priority is taken into account in case a user has several roles or groups assigned to it.
