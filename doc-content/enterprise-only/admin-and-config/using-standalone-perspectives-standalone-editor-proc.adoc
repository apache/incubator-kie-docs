= Using the standalone editor perspective

You can use the standalone editor perspective of {CENTRAL} to access an asset's specific editor. By using this perspective, you can open an asset's editor and can modify the asset as required.

The web address for accessing an asset's standalone editor perspective contains the `standalone` and `path` parameters. The `path` parameter must contain the complete path to the asset and the web address can end with `_#StandaloneEditorPerspective_` string. Also, by varying the `path` parameter, you can access a specific asset's editor in the standalone mode.
