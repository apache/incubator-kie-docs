. Select or create the space into which you want to add a new project from an archetype template.
. Click *Add Project*.
. Type the project name and description in the *Name* and *Description* fields respectively.
. Click *Configure Advanced Options*.
. Select the *Based on template* check box.
. Select the archetype from drop-down options if required. The default archetype is selected that is already set in the space.
. Click *Add*.

The *Assets* view of the project opens based on the selected archetype template.
