= Auto acknowledging execution errors

When executions errors occur they are unacknowledged by default, and require a manual acknowledgment to be performed otherwise they are always seen as information that requires attention. In case of larger volumes, manual actions can be time consuming and not suitable in some situations.

Auto acknowledgment resolves this issue. It is based on scheduled jobs by way of the `jbpm-executor`, with the following three types of jobs available:

`org.jbpm.executor.commands.error.JobAutoAckErrorCommand`::
Responsible for finding jobs that previously failed but now are either canceled, completed, or rescheduled for another execution. This job only acknowledges execution errors of type `Job`.
`org.jbpm.executor.commands.error.TaskAutoAckErrorCommand`::
Responsible for auto acknowledgment of user task execution errors for tasks that previously failed but now are in one of the exit states (completed, failed, exited, obsolete). This job only acknowledges execution errors of type `Task`.
`org.jbpm.executor.commands.error.ProcessAutoAckErrorCommand`::
Responsible for auto acknowledgment of process instances that have errors attached. It acknowledges errors where the process instance is already finished (completed or aborted), or the task that the error originated from is already finished. This is based on `init_activity_id` value. This job acknowledges any type of execution error that matches the above criteria.

Jobs can be registered on the {KIE_SERVER}. In {CENTRAL} you can configure auto acknowledge jobs for errors:

.Prerequisites
* Execution errors of one or more type have accumulated during processes execution but require no further attention.

.Procedure
. In {CENTRAL}, click *Menu* -> *Manage* -> *Jobs*.
. In the top right of the screen, click *New Job*.
. Type the process correlation key into the *Business Key* field.
. In the *Type* field, add type of the auto acknowledge job type from the list above.
. Select a *Due On* time for the job to be completed:
.. To run the job immediately, select the `Run now` option.
.. To run the job at a specific time, select `Run later`. A date and time field appears next to the `Run later` option. Click the field to open the calendar and schedule a specific time and date for the job.

. Click *Create* to create the job and return to the *Manage Jobs* page.

The following steps are optional, and allow you to configure auto acknowledge jobs to run either once (`SingleRun`), on specific time intervals (`NextRun`), or using the custom name of an entity manager factory to search for jobs to acknowledge (`EmfName`).

. Click on the *Advanced* tab.
. Click the *Add Parameter* button.
. Enter the configuration parameter you want to apply to the job:
.. `SingleRun`: `true` or `false`
.. `NextRun`: time expression, such as 2h, 5d, 1m, and so on.
.. `EmfName`: custom entity manager factory name.
