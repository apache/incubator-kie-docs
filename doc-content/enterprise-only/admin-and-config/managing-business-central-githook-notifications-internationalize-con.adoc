= Git hook notification internationalization support

You can internationalize notification messages by placing additional properties files in the same path as the original properties file specified as the `appformer.git.hooks.bundle` system property.

The name of the different localized files must be `<filename>_<lang>.properties`, where the `<filename>` is the same as the original. For example, where the system property points to `Messages.properties`, you can create `Messages_en.properties` for English, `Messages_fr.properties` for French, or `Messages_it.properties` for Italian.

The notification service will choose the properties file based on the user language, if there are no available translations for that language it will use the entries from the original `Messages.properties` file.
