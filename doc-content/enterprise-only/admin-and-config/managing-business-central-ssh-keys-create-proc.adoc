= Creating an SSH key

Before you can add or register SSH keys to {CENTRAL}, you must generate an SSH key on your system.

.Procedure
. Open a command terminal on your system.
. Run the `ssh-keygen` command to create the SSH key as shown in the following example, where `<user_login>` is your user name:
+
[source]
----
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "<user_login>"
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The SSH key formats supported by {CENTRAL} keystore are `ssh-rsa`, `ssh-dss`, `ecdsa-sha2-nistp256`, `ecdsa-sha2-nistp384`, and `ecdsa-sha2-nistp521`.
====
. When prompted, press Enter and accept the default key file location as shown in the following example, where `<user_login>` is your user name:
+
[source]
----
Enter a file in which to save the key (/home/<user_login>/.ssh/id_rsa): [Press enter]
----
. At the command prompt, enter and confirm the passphrase:
+
[source]
----
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase]
Enter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]
----
. Start the `ssh-agent`:
+
[source]
----
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
Agent pid <any-number-here>
----
. Add the new SSH private key to the `ssh-agent`. If you have used a different key name, replace `id_rsa` in that code:
+
[source]
----
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
----
