= Dashbuilder Runtime

Dashbuilder Runtime is an add-on {PRODUCT} application WAR that you can use to view dashboards created in and exported from {CENTRAL}. This is useful for reviewing business metrics in {EAP} installations that do not have {CENTRAL}.

.Prerequisites
* You have created and exported a dashboard in {CENTRAL}. For more information about exporting Dashbuilder data, see the "Exporting and importing Dashbuilder data" section in the {URL_MANAGING_SETTINGS}[_{CONFIGURING_CENTRAL}_] guide.

.Procedure
. Navigate to the https://access.redhat.com/jbossnetwork/restricted/listSoftware.html[Software Downloads] page in the Red Hat Customer Portal (login required), and select the product and version from the drop-down options:
+
* *Product:* {PRODUCT_SHORT}
* *Version:* {PRODUCT_VERSION}
. Download *{PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION_LONG} Add Ons* (`{PRODUCT_FILE}-add-ons.zip`) and extract the ZIP file.
. Navigate to the directory that contains the extracted files and extract the `{PRODUCT_FILE}-dashbuilder-runtime.zip` file.
//Need more instructions here.

.  If no static dashboards are configured then Dashbuilder Runtime prompts you to upload a dashboard. When the dashboard is uploaded the runtime will only use that dashboard until the runtime is restarted.
//How would a static dashboard be configured?

Navigation between pages in the dashboard is identical to the navigation of the dashboard in the {CENTRAL} where it was created. The group that a page belongs to will be imported and will remain as the navigation in Dashbuilder Runtime. If a page is not in the navigation tree then the page is added to the *Dashboards* menu group. If there is no navigation exported then all pages are added to the *Dashboards* menu group.
