Dashbuilder Runtime is an add-on application for {PRODUCT} that you can use to run dashboards in standalone installations without requiring to use {CENTRAL} for business metrics. Dashbuilder Runtime is available as a WAR file that you can run on {EAP}. To use Dashbuilder Runtime, you first author dashboards in {CENTRAL}, export the assets from {CENTRAL}, and run them on a web application. For more information about exporting Dashbuilder data, see {URL_MANAGING_SETTINGS}#exporting-importing-dashbuilder-data-proc-configuring-central[_Exporting and importing Dashbuilder data_] in the _{CONFIGURING_CENTRAL}_ guide.

Users with access to Dashbuilder Runtime are able to import the assets and explore the dashboards without using {CENTRAL}. If no static dashboards are configured then Dashbuilder Runtime prompts the user to upload a dashboard. When the dashboard is uploaded the runtime will only use that dashboard until the runtime is restarted.

The navigation between pages is the same as the configuration in Business Central. This means that if "page 1" is in "group1" and "page 2" is in "group2", then the same group will be imported and will remain as the navigation in Dashbuilder Runtime. If a page is not in the navigation tree the page is added to the "dashboards" menu group. If there is no navigation exported then all pages are added to the "dashboards" menu group.
