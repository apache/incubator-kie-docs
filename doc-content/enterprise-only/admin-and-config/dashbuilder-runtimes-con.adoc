= Dashbuilder Runtime

Dashbuilder Runtime is an add-on {PRODUCT} application WAR that you can use to view dashboards created in and exported from {CENTRAL}. This is useful for reviewing business metrics in {EAP} installations that do not have {CENTRAL}.

Navigation between the pages of a dashboard in dashbuilder Runtime is identical to navigation in the {CENTRAL} where the dashboard was created. If a page belongs to a group, that group is imported to Dashbuilder Runtime as well as the page. If a page is imported to Dashbuilder Runtime but not used for navigation, then the page is added to the *Runtime Dashboards* menu group. If no navigation is exported then all pages are added to the *Runtime Dashboards* menu group.
