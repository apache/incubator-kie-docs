= Dashbuilder Runtime and Dashbuilder Standalone

Dashbuilder Runtime and Dashbuilder Standalone are add-ons that you can use to view dashboards created in and exported from {CENTRAL}. This is useful for reviewing business metrics in environments that do not have {CENTRAL}. Dashbuilder Runtime is available to install on {EAP}. You can deploy Dashbuilder Standalone on {OPENSHIFT}.

Navigation between the pages of a dashboard in Dashbuilder Runtime and Dashbuilder Standalone is identical to navigation in the {CENTRAL} instance where the dashboard was created. If a page belongs to a group, that group is imported to Dashbuilder Runtime or Dashbuilder Standalone as well as the page. If a page is imported to Dashbuilder Runtime or Dashbuilder Standalone but not used in navigation, then the page is added to the *Runtime Dashboards* menu group. If no navigation is exported then all pages are added to the *Runtime Dashboards* menu group.
