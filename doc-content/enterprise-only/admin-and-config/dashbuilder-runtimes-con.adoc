= Dashbuilder Runtime

Dashbuilder Runtime is an add-on {PRODUCT} application that you can use to view dashboards created in and exported from {CENTRAL} to review business metrics in installations that do not have {CENTRAL}. It is a WAR file that runs on EAP.

.Prerequisites
* You have created and exported a dashboard in {CENTRAL}. For more information about exporting Dashbuilder data, see {URL_MANAGING_SETTINGS}#exporting-importing-dashbuilder-data-proc-configuring-central[_Exporting and importing Dashbuilder data_] in the _{CONFIGURING_CENTRAL}_ guide.

.Procedure
. Navigate to the https://access.redhat.com/jbossnetwork/restricted/listSoftware.html[Software Downloads] page in the Red Hat Customer Portal (login required), and select the product and version from the drop-down options:
+
* *Product:* {PRODUCT_SHORT}
* *Version:* {PRODUCT_VERSION}
. Download {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION_LONG} Add Ons* (`{PRODUCT_FILE}-add-ons.zip`) and extract the ZIP file.
. Navigate to the directory that contains the extract files and extract the `{PRODUCT_FILE}-dashbuilder-runtime.zip` file.
//Need more instructions here.

.  If no static dashboards are configured then Dashbuilder Runtime prompts you to upload a dashboard. When the dashboard is uploaded the runtime will only use that dashboard until the runtime is restarted.
//How would a static dashboard be configured?

The navigation between pages in the dashboard is identical to the navigation of the dashboard in the {CENTRAL} where it was created. This means that if page 1 is in group1 and page 2 is in group2, then the same group will be imported and will remain as the navigation in Dashbuilder Runtime. If a page is not in the navigation tree then the page is added to the *Dashboards* menu group. If there is no navigation exported then all pages are added to the *Dashboards* menu group.
//Emily needs to rework this after more info is available.
