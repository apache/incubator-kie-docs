= Archetype management

{CENTRAL} provides an archetype management feature that enables you to list, add, validate, set as default, and delete the archetypes. You can manage archetypes from the *Archetypes* page in {CENTRAL}. Archetypes are projects that are installed in Apache Maven repositories in which a template structure is set or can be created if required.

For the most up-to-date and detailed information about archetypes, see the https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-archetypes.html[Introduction to Archetypes page].
