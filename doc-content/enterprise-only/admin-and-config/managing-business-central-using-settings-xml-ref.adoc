= Configuring Maven using settings.xml

Java application development uses Apache Maven which is a distributed build automation tool to build and manage software projects. Maven uses configuration XML files called POM (Project Object Model) to define project properties and manage the build process. POM files describe the project's module and component dependencies, build order, and targets for the resulting project packaging and output. This ensures that projects are built in a correct and uniform manner.

Maven uses repositories to store Java libraries, plug-ins, and other build artifacts. Repositories can be either local or remote. A local repository is a download of artifacts from a remote repository cached on a local machine. A remote repository is any other repository accessed using common protocols, such as `http://` when located on an HTTP server, or `file://` when located on a file server. The default repository is the public remote Maven 2 Central Repository.
Configuration of Maven is performed by modifying the settings.xml file. You can either configure global Maven settings in the `M2_HOME/conf/settings.xml` file, or user-level settings in the `USER_HOME/.m2/settings.xml` file.
