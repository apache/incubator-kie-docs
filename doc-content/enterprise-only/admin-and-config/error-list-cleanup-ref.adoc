= Cleaning up the error list

The `ExecutionErrorInfo` error list table can be cleaned up to remove redundant information. Depending on the life cycle of the process, errors may remain in the list for some time, and there is no direct API with which to clean up the list. Instead, the `ExecutionErrorCleanupCommand` command can be scheduled to periodically clean up errors.

The following parameters can be set for the clean up command. The command is restricted to deleting execution errors of already completed or aborted process instances:

* `DateFormat`
** Date format for further date related parameters - if not given `yyyy-MM-dd` is used (pattern of `SimpleDateFormat` class).
* `EmfName`
** Name of the entity manager factory to be used for queries (valid persistence unit name).
* `SingleRun`
** Indicates if execution should be single run only (`true`|`false`).
* `NextRun`
** Provides next execution time (valid time expression, for example: 1d, 5h, and so on)
* `OlderThan`
** Indicates what errors should be deleted - older than given date.
* `OlderThanPeriod`
** Indicated what errors should be deleted older than given time expression (valid time expression e.g. 1d, 5h, and so on)
* `ForProcess`
** Indicates errors to be deleted only for given process definition.
* `ForProcessInstance`
** Indicates errors to be deleted only for given process instance.
* `ForDeployment`
** Indicates errors to be deleted that are from given deployment ID.
