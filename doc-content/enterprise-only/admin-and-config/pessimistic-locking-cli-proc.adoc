= Configuring pessimistic locking support via code

You can set the locking mechanism on a per process basis and to allow it to be _pessimistic_ . You can make the changes at a per KIE Session level or Runtime Manager level as well and not just at the process level.

To set a process to use pessimistic locking, use the following configuration in the runtime environment:

[source]
----

import org.kie.api.runtime.Environment;
import org.kie.api.runtime.EnvironmentName;
import org.kie.api.runtime.manager.RuntimeManager;
import org.kie.api.runtime.manager.RuntimeManagerFactory;

...

env.set(EnvironmentName.USE_PESSIMISTIC_LOCKING, true);  <1>

RuntimeManager manager = RuntimeManagerFactory.Factory.get().newPerRequestRuntimeManager(environment);  <2>
----
<1> `env` is an instance of `org.kie.api.runtime.Environment`.
<2> Create your Runtime Manager by using this environment.
