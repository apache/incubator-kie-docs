= Customizing Git hook notifications

{CENTRAL} provides a mechanism that enables users to receive customized Git hook notifications based on the hook exit codes.

To enable the notification mechanism you must create a `*.properties` file containing the custom messages and then specify the path to that file as the value of the `appformer.git.hooks.bundle` system property.

.Procedure

. Create the `*.properties` file and add a line for each exit code with a corresponding message in the following format:
+
`<exit_code>=<display_message>`
+
The `<exit_code>` is the Git hook exit code and the `<display_message>` is the custom message that is displayed to a user.
+
For example:
+
[source]
----
0=Success! All working as expected.
1=Warning! Please check the logs and advise your admin.
.
.
31=Error! Please advise your admin immediately.
----
+
[NOTE]
====
It is not necessary to define all the possible exit codes in the *.properties file. Notifications appear only for the exit codes defined in the *.properties file.
====
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The notification service only supports the `ISO 8859-1` (`LATIN 1`) character set in the properties file. If you want to use extended characters, please use their escaped Unicode character code sequences.
====

. To enable Git hook notifications, specify the path to the file as the value of the `appformer.git.hooks.bundle` system property.
+
See the following example of a `standalone.xml` file with the setting that points to a `Messages.properties` file:
+
[source]
----
<system-properties>
  <property name="appformer.git.hooks.bundle" value="/opt/jboss-as/git-hooks-messages/Messages.properties">
  </property>
  ...
</system-properties>
