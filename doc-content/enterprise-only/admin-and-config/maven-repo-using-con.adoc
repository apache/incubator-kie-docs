= Maven settings and repositories for {PRODUCT}

When you create a {PRODUCT} project, {CENTRAL} uses the Maven repositories that are configured for {CENTRAL}. You can use the Maven global or user settings to direct all {PRODUCT} projects to retrieve dependencies from the public {PRODUCT} repository by modifying the Maven project object model (POM) file (`pom.xml`). You can also configure {CENTRAL} and {KIE_SERVER} to use an external Maven repository or prepare a Maven mirror for offline use.

For more information about {PRODUCT} packaging and deployment options, see  {URL_PACKAGING_DEPLOYING_PROJECT}[_{PACKAGING_DEPLOYING_PROJECT}_].
