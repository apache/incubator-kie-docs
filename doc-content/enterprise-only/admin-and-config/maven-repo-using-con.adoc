= Maven settings and repositories for Red Hat Process Automation Manager

When you create a Red Hat Process Automation Manager project, {CENTRAL} uses the Maven repositories that are configured for {CENTRAL}. You can use the Maven global or user settings to direct all Red Hat Process Automation Manager projects to retrieve dependencies from the public Red Hat Process Automation Manager repository by modifying the Maven project object model (POM) file (`pom.xml`). You can also configure {CENTRAL} and {KIE_SERVER} to use an external Maven repository or prepare a Maven mirror for offline use.
