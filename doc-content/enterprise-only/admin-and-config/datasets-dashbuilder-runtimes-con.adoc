= {KIE_SERVER} data sets on Dashbuilder Runtime

A data set is a collection of related information. If you have a {KIE_SERVER} that contains imported data sets, you can use Dashbuilder Runtime and the {KIE_SERVER} REST API to run queries on imported data sets.

Because {KIE_SERVER} uses {CENTRAL} as a controller, {KIE_SERVER} containers are created in {CENTRAL}. Data sets are also created in {CENTRAL}. The {KIE_SERVER} configuration is a template that you can refer to when you create data sets or install containers.

Other services, such as Dashbuilder Runtime, use the {KIE_SERVER} REST API to retrieve {KIE_SERVER} information. Dashbuilder Runtime accesses the {KIE_SERVER} REST API to run queries from data sets.

When a {KIE_SERVER} data set is created in {CENTRAL}, the server template information is provided and it is used by Dashbuilder Runtime to look for the {KIE_SERVER} information. For example:

----
dashbuilder.kieserver.serverTemplate.{SERVER_TEMPLATE}.location={LOCATION}
dashbuilder.kieserver.serverTemplate.{SERVER_TEMPLATE}.user={USER}
dashbuilder.kieserver.serverTemplate.{SERVER_TEMPLATE}.password={PASSWORD}
dashbuilder.kieserver.serverTemplate.{SERVER_TEMPLATE}.token={TOKEN}
----

You can also setup {KIE_SERVER} for each  data set. For example:
----
dashbuilder.kieserver.dataset.{DATA_SET_NAME}.location={LOCATION}
dashbuilder.kieserver.dataset.{DATA_SET_NAME}.user={USER}
dashbuilder.kieserver.dataset.{DATA_SET_NAME}.password={PASSWORD}
dashbuilder.kieserver.dataset.{DATA_SET_NAME}.token={TOKEN}
----

NOTE: Token authentication is not used if credentials are provided.

You might want to run the dashboard against another {KIE_SERVER} installation. When data sets are created on a {KIE_SERVER} in a development environment, the data sets queries are created on the development {KIE_SERVER}, for example DEV. If the dashboards are exported to a production environment, for example PROD, with a different {KIE_SERVER}, the queries that you created in DEV are not available, so an error is thrown. In this case it is possible to port queries from  a data set to another {KIE_SERVER} by using the replace query functionality, either through a server template or a data set:


* Server template example:
+
----
dashbuilder.kieserver.serverTemplate.{SERVER_TEMPLATE}.replace_query=true
----

*  Data set example:
+
----
dashbuilder.kieserver.dataset.{DATA_SET_NAME}.replace_query=true
----

The `replace_query=true property` only needs to be set once so that Dashbuilder Runtime creates the queries. After the queries are created you can remove this system property.
