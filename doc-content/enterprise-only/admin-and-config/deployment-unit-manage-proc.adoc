= Starting, stopping, and removing deployment units in {CENTRAL}

When a deployment unit is started, the services in the deployment unit are available for use. If only one {KIE_SERVER} is connected to {CENTRAL}, or if all connected {KIE_SERVERS} are in the same server configuration, services are started in a deployment unit automatically when a project is deployed. If multiple server configurations are available, you are prompted upon deployment to specify server and deployment details and to start the deployment unit. However, at any time you can manually start, stop, or remove deployment units in {CENTRAL} to manage your deployed services as needed.

.Procedure

. In {CENTRAL}, go to *Menu* -> *Deploy* -> *Execution servers*.
. Under *Server Configurations*, select a configuration.
. Under *Deployment Units*, select a deployment unit.
. Click *Start*, *Stop*, or *Remove* in the upper-right corner. To remove a running deployment unit, stop it and then remove it.
