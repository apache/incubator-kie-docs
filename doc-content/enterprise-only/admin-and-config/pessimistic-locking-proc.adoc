= Pessimistic Locking Support

The default locking mechanism for persistence of processes is __optimistic__. With multi-thread high concurrency to the same process instance, this locking strategy can result in bad performance.

This can be changed at runtime to allow the user to set locking on a per process basis and to allow it to be _pessimistic_ (the change can be made at a per KIE Session level or Runtime Manager level as well and not just at the process level).

To set a process to use pessimistic locking, use the following configuration in the runtime environment:

[source]
----

import org.kie.api.runtime.Environment;
import org.kie.api.runtime.EnvironmentName;
import org.kie.api.runtime.manager.RuntimeManager;
import org.kie.api.runtime.manager.RuntimeManagerFactory;

...

env.set(EnvironmentName.USE_PESSIMISTIC_LOCKING, true);  <1>

RuntimeManager manager = RuntimeManagerFactory.Factory.get().newPerRequestRuntimeManager(environment);  <2>
----
<1> `env` is an instance of `org.kie.api.runtime.Environment`.
<2> Create your Runtime Manager by using this environment.
