= Managing artifacts

You can manage artifacts from the *Artifacts* page in {CENTRAL}. The artifact repository is a local Maven repository and there is only one Maven repository for each installation. {CENTRAL} recommends using Maven repository solutions like _Sonatype Nexus(TM)_, _Apache Archiva(TM)_, or _JFrog Artifactory(TM)_.

The *Artifacts* page lists all the artifacts in the Maven repository. You can also upload a new artifact to the Maven repository using the *Upload* button.

[NOTE]
=====
Only _*.jar_, _*.kjar_, or _pom.xml_ files can be uploaded to the Artifacts repository.
