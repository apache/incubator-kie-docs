= Customizing Dashbuilder Runtime

You can use system properties to customize Dashbuilder Runtime.

Dashboards Path::

When a dashboard is uploaded it is stored in the filesystem. The path where it is stored is controlled by the system property `dashbuilder.import.base.dir`. The default is `/tmp/dashbuilder`.
+
The system property is the root path for any dashboard model. For example, if there are multiple files on this path, the file can be imported by accessing Dashbuilder Runtime and passing a query parameter import with the name of the file that should be loaded. For example, if you want to load the `sales_dashboard`, execute `runtime_host?import=sales_dashboard` and Dashbuilder Runtime will try to load the file `/tmp/dashbuilder/sales_dashboard.zip`.

Static Dashboard::

If you want the runtime instance to load a specific dashboard, you can change the system property `dashbuilder.runtime.import`. Setting the property to a local file path will cause that specific dashboard to be loaded during Runtime startup.

Controlling upload size::

Application servers control POST request size by default. You can control the allowable size of uploaded dashboards by using the system property `dashbuilder.runtime.upload.size`. The size should be in KB and by default the value is 96kb, meaning that if someone tries to upload a file larger than 96kb then an error will be displayed and the dashboard wonâ€™t be installed.

Loading external dashboards::

A Dashboard that is located at an accessible URL can be accessed by Dashbuilder Runtime. You can access the URL by passing the URL with the import query parameter such as `runtime_host?import=http://filesHost/sales_dashboard.zip`.
+
NOTE: For security reasons this option is disabled by default. You can enable it by setting the system property `dashbuilder.runtime.allowExternal` as true.
