= Creating KIE containers (deployment units)

KIE containers, or _deployment units_, are self-contained environments that have been provisioned to hold instances of your packaged and deployed rule instances.

.Prerequisites
* The {KIE_SERVER} to which you want to deploy KIE containers is registered.

.Procedure
. Log in to {CENTRAL}.
. In the main menu, click *Menu* -> *Deploy* -> *Execution Servers*.
. Under *Server Configurations* -> *+ New Server Configuration*.
. In the *New Server Configuration* window, click *Deployment Unit*.
. Enter the *Group Name*, *Artifact Id*, and *Version* manually.
+
Alternatively, enter the name of your container and search for the project you want to deploy in the container.

. Click *Select* next to the project to automatically enter the details of the project.

+
[WARNING]
====
When entering the deployment unit version number, do _not_ use the `LATEST` or `RELEASE` keywords. This feature has been deprecated and can cause deployment issues.
====
. To deploy the container automatically, select the *Start Deployment Unit?* box.
. Click *Finish*.

After the container is successfully created, select the container from the list and click *Start* at the upper right hand corner to start it

To verify that the container is running, send a [GET] request to the endpoint.
