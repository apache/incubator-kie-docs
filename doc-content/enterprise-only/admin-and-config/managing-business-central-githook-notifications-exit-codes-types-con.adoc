= Types of exit codes

{CENTRAL} has the following three types of exit codes:

.Successful notification
`0`: Success. A git hook that exits with code `0` displays a success notification in the user interface.

.Warning notification
`1..30`: Warning. A git hook that exits with a code between `1` and `30` (inclusive) will display a warning notification in user interface.

.Error notification
Anything else: Error. Any other code number will be displayed as an error notification.

[IMPORTANT]
====
UNIX systems only support error codes between 0 (success) and 255 (error). Any exit code outside of this range is converted to a different code which might result in displaying a wrong notification message.
Windows systems don't have this limitation and can support a wide range of exit codes.
