= Types of exit codes

{CENTRAL} has the following three types of exit codes:

.Successful notification
`0`: Success. A git hook that exits with code `0` will display a success notification on the user interface.

.Warning notification
`1..30`: Warning. A git hook that exits with a code between `1` and `30` (included) will display a warning notification on user interface.

.Error notification
Anything else: Error. Any other code number will be displayed as an error notification.

[IMPORTANT]
====
*UNIX* machines only support error codes between 0 (success) to 255 (error), any exit code outside of this range will
end up being converted into a different code which may result in displaying a wrong notification message.
*Windows* machines don't have this limitation and can support a wide range of exit codes.
