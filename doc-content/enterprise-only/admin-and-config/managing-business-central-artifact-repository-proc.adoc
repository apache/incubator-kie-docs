= Customizing artifact repository properties

In some cases, projects need to resolve external dependencies to build domain model Jars. A repository contains the needed artifacts which has the following features:

* It's a Maven repository.
* All snapshots are time stamped.
* Mostly stored in the local hard drive

By default, the artifact repository is in `$WORKING_DIRECTORY/repositories/kie`.

.Procedure
. Log in to {CENTRAL}.
. Go to *Admin* -> *Artifact Repository*. The *Artifact Repository* page opens.
. Make selections and enter information in the *Properties* section.
. Click *Save*.
