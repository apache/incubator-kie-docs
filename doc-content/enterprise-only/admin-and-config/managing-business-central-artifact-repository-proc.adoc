= Customizing artifact repository properties

In some cases, projects need to resolve external dependencies to build domain model JAR files. A repository contains the needed artifacts and has the following features:

* The repository is a Maven repository.
* All snapshots are time stamped.
* Assets are stored mostly in the local hard drive.

By default, the artifact repository is in `$WORKING_DIRECTORY/repositories/kie`.

.Procedure
. In {CENTRAL}, select the *Admin* icon in the top-right corner of the screen and select *Artifact Repository*. The *Artifact Repository* page opens.
. Make selections and enter information in the *Properties* section.
. Click *Save*.
