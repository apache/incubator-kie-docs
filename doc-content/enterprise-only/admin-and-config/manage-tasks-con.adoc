= Task management

Tasks that are assigned to the current user appear in *Menu* -> *Track* -> *Task Inbox* in {CENTRAL}. You can click a task to open and begin working on it.

A user task can be assigned to a particular user, multiple users, or to a group. If assigned to multiple users or a group it appears in the task lists of all assigned users and any of the possible actors can claim the task. When a task is assigned to another user it no longer appears in your *Task Inbox*.

Business administrators can view and manage all user tasks from the *Tasks* page in {CENTRAL}, located under *Menu* -> *Manage* -> *Tasks*. Users with the `admin` or `process-admin` role can access the *Tasks* page but do not have access rights to view and manage tasks by default.

To manage all the tasks, a user must be specified as a process administrator by defining any of the following conditions:

* User is specified as `task admin user`. The default value is `Administrator`.
* User belongs to the task administrators group. The default value is `Administrators`.

You can configure the user and user group assignment with the `org.jbpm.ht.admin.user` and `org.jbpm.ht.admin.group` system properties.

You can open, view, and modify the details of a task, such as the due date, the priority, or the task description, by clicking a task in the list. The following tabs are available in the task page:

* *Details*: Displays information such as task description, status, and due date.
* *Assignments*: Displays the current owner of the task and enables you to delegate the task to another person or group.
* *Comments*: Displays comments added by task user(s). You can delete an existing comment and add a new comment.
* *Admin*: Displays the potential owner of the task and enables you to forward the task to another person or group. It also displays the actual owner of the task and you can send a reminder to the actual owner of the task.
* *Logs*: Displays task logs containing task life cycle events (such as task started, claimed, completed), updates made to task fields (such as task due date and priority).

You can filter the tasks based on the filter parameters available by clicking the *Filters* icon on the left side of the page. For more information about filtering, see <<sect-task-filtering-managing-and-monitoring-processes>>.

In addition to these, you can create custom filters to filter tasks based on the query parameters you define.
