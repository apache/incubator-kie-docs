= Task management

Tasks that are assigned to the current user appear in *Menu* -> *Track* -> *Task Inbox* in {CENTRAL}. You can click on a task to open and begin working on it.

A user task can be assigned to a particular user, multiple users, or to a group. If assigned to multiple users or a group it appears in the task lists of all assigned users and any of the possible actors can claim the task. When a task is assigned to another user it no longer appears in your *Task Inbox*.

Users with the `process-admin` role can view and manage all user tasks from the *Tasks* page in {CENTRAL}, located under *Menu* -> *Manage* -> *Tasks*. Users with the `admin` role can access the *Tasks* page but do not have access rights to view and manage tasks by default.

You can open, view, and modify the details of a task, such as the due date, the priority, or the task description, by clicking a task in the list. The following tabs are available in the task page:
