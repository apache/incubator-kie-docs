= Managing GAV checks

In {CENTRAL}, projects are identified using Maven naming convention or GAV (group Id, artifact, and version) data. GAV values differentiate projects and project versions as well as identify dependencies with particular projects.

By default, {CENTRAL} detects duplicate GAVs. This feature can be disabled by users with the _admin_ role.
