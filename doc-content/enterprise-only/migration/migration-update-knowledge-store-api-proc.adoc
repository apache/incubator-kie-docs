= Update API references to {CENTRAL} Knowledge Store

The Knowledge Store REST API has been deprecated in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}, but certain endpoints are still supported so that you can continue to manage {CENTRAL} resources. If any of your applications interact with {CENTRAL} spaces (previously known as organizational units), repositories, and projects through Knowledge Store REST API calls (`/{URL_COMPONENT_CENTRAL}/rest/`), you must update these API references according to the new endpoints supported in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}.

.Procedure
Wherever applicable in your application code, replace any legacy REST API calls to the {CENTRAL} Knowledge Store in the format `\http://<SERVER>:<PORT>/{URL_COMPONENT_CENTRAL}/rest/<ENDPOINT>` with the new corresponding Knowledge Store REST API calls listed in
ifdef::DM[]
xref:knowledge-store-rest-api-endpoints-ref_non-exec-server[].
endif::DM[]
ifdef::PAM[]
ifeval::["{context}" == "non-exec-server"]
 xref:knowledge-store-rest-api-endpoints-ref_non-exec-server[].
endif::[]
ifeval::["{context}" == "exec-server"]
 xref:knowledge-store-rest-api-endpoints-ref_exec-server[].
endif::[]
endif::PAM[]

As a result of the restructured content in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}, the endpoints may differ between the legacy {CENTRAL} REST API calls and the corresponding REST API calls in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}. Be sure to use the new endpoints to replace your legacy {CENTRAL} REST API calls. If you cannot find a corresponding REST API call in the list to replace a legacy call, then that call is no longer supported in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}.

The following example is an update to a Knowledge Store REST API call for spaces.

Legacy Knowledge Store REST API call:
[source,subs="attributes+"]
----
http://localhost:8080/{URL_COMPONENT_CENTRAL}/rest/organizational-units
----

New Knowledge Store REST API call:
[source,subs="attributes+"]
----
http://localhost:8080/{URL_COMPONENT_CENTRAL}/rest/spaces
----
