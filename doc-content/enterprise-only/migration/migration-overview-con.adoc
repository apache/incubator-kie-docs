If you use {PRODUCT_OLD} and install {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}, you need to migrate the applications that you created in {PRODUCT_OLD} to the new product. Red Hat provides migration and upgrade tools wherever possible to facilitate migration.

The main change in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} that affects product migration is a new repository structure for {CENTRAL} project data. Business assets that you created in {CENTRAL} with {PRODUCT_OLD} must be migrated using the {CENTRAL} migration tool provided with this release to accommodate a new data structure. Project data is restructured in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} so that each space (previously organizational unit) contains repositories that correspond to individual projects, instead of multiple projects in a single repository as in {PRODUCT_OLD}. This improved structure means that you do not need to create and manage repositories in the new {CENTRAL} and can focus on developing your business assets.

Migration paths are available for {CENTRAL} distributions and for environments with Java projects moving to {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}.

If you use {PRODUCT_OLD} and install {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}, you need to migrate the applications that you created and possibly your server environment to the new product. Red Hat provides migration and upgrade tools wherever possible to facilitate migration, but in some cases, manual migration or asset re-creation is required.

The following are the main changes in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} that affect product migration:

* *New repository structure for {CENTRAL} project data:* Business assets that you created in {CENTRAL} with {PRODUCT_OLD} must be migrated using the {CENTRAL} migration tool provided with this release to accommodate a new data structure. Project data is restructured in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} so that each space (previously organizational unit) contains repositories that correspond to individual projects, instead of multiple projects in a single repository as in {PRODUCT_OLD}. This improved structure means that you do not need to create and manage repositories in the new {CENTRAL} and can focus on developing Business assets.
* *No execution server capabilities in {CENTRAL}:* In {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}, {CENTRAL} no longer has execution server capabilities nor any API endpoints related to the execution server. Instead, the {KIE_SERVER} performs all execution and runtime functions and {CENTRAL} is used for application development and management only. Therefore, any {CENTRAL} environments that are currently used as an execution server must be properly migrated to the new {CENTRAL} and {KIE_SERVER} environments to retain live tasks and process instances in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}. If any applications interact with the {CENTRAL} execution server through the remote Java API or through direct REST API calls, these API references must be redirected to the {KIE_SERVER} API.
* *Upgraded database schema:* {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} contains updates to the database schema for optimal performance with the new {CENTRAL} and {KIE_SERVER}. The {PRODUCT_OLD} database to be used with {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} must be updated using one of the upgrade scripts provided with this release to accommodate the change.

The following migration paths are available, depending on your {PRODUCT_OLD} environment:

* xref:migration-non-execution-server-con[]
* xref:migration-execution-server-con[]
* xref:migration-java-projects-con[]
endif::PAM[]

IMPORTANT: If you are using a version older than {PRODUCT_OLD}, migrate your projects to version 6.4 before migrating to {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}. For migration instructions, see the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_bpm_suite/6.4/html-single/migration_guide/index[Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.4 Migration Guide]

If you use {PRODUCT_OLD} and install {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}, you must use the {CENTRAL} migration tool provided with this release to migrate the applications that you created in {PRODUCT_OLD} to the new product. The reason for this migration requirement is that project data is restructured in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} so that each space (previously organizational unit) contains repositories that correspond to individual projects, instead of multiple projects in a single repository as in {PRODUCT_OLD}. This improved structure means that you do not need to create and manage repositories in the new {CENTRAL} and can focus on developing your business assets.

{PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} also contains {PLANNER} updates that you may need to apply to the relevant {PLANNER} assets in your project, if applicable.
