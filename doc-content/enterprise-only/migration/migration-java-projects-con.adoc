Projects that you developed in Java code in {PRODUCT_OLD} (for example, in Eclipse) also require modification for {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}. You must update the dependencies in the `pom.xml` file for each

project

ifdef::PAM[]
project, upgrade the database configured for the project,
endif::PAM[]
and rebuild the project. To migrate your Java client applications, you also must update the dependencies in the `pom.xml` file for each project. If your application uses an embedded {PRODUCT_OLD} engine
ifdef::PAM[]
(jBPM, Drools, OptaPlanner),

ifdef::DM[]
(Drools),

this change also updates the engines. If the application calls the {KIE_SERVER}, the API client library is updated.
