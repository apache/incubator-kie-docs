= Configure and start {KIE_SERVER}

After you have migrated all {CENTRAL} data and have upgraded the relevant database, configure and start the new {KIE_SERVER} to transfer the execution server functionality and apply the migrated changes.

.Prerequisites
* Project data from {PRODUCT_OLD} has been migrated using the {CENTRAL} migration tool.
* The {PRODUCT_OLD} database to be used with {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} has been upgraded.
* All API references to {CENTRAL} execution server in application code have been redirected to the {KIE_SERVER}.

= Configuring and starting {KIE_SERVER}

You can configure your {KIE_SERVER} location, user name, password, and other related properties by defining the necessary configurations when you start {KIE_SERVER}.
endif::[]

.Procedure
Navigate to the {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} `bin` directory and start the new {KIE_SERVER} with the following properties. Adjust the specific properties according to your environment.

[source,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ ~/EAP_HOME/bin/standalone.sh --server-config=standalone-full.xml <1>
-Dorg.kie.server.id=myserver <2>
-Dorg.kie.server.user={URL_COMPONENT_KIE_SERVER}_username <3>
-Dorg.kie.server.pwd={URL_COMPONENT_KIE_SERVER}_password <4>
-Dorg.kie.server.controller=http://localhost:8080/{URL_COMPONENT_CENTRAL}/rest/controller <5>
-Dorg.kie.server.controller.user=controller_username <6>
-Dorg.kie.server.controller.pwd=controller_password <7>
-Dorg.kie.server.location=http://localhost:8080/kie-server/services/rest/server <8>
-Dorg.kie.server.persistence.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect <9>
-Dorg.kie.server.persistence.ds=java:jboss/datasources/psjbpmDS <10>
----
<1> Start command with `standalone-full.xml` server profile
<2> Server ID that must match the server configuration name defined in {CENTRAL}
<3> User name to connect with {KIE_SERVER} from the {CONTROLLER}
<4> Password to connect with {KIE_SERVER} from the {CONTROLLER}
<5> {CONTROLLER} location, {CENTRAL} URL with `/rest/controller` suffix
<6> User name to connect to the {CONTROLLER} REST API
<7> Password to connect to the {CONTROLLER} REST API
<8> {KIE_SERVER} location (on the same instance as {CENTRAL} in this example)
<9> Hibernate dialect to be used
<10> JNDI name of the data source used for your previous {PRODUCT_OLD} database

[NOTE]
====
If {CENTRAL} and {KIE_SERVER} are installed on separate application server instances ({EAP} or other), use a separate port for the {KIE_SERVER} location to avoid port conflicts with {CENTRAL}. If a separate {KIE_SERVER} port has not already been configured, you can add a port offset and adjust the {KIE_SERVER} port value accordingly in the {KIE_SERVER} properties.

Example:

[source]
----
-Djboss.socket.binding.port-offset=150
-Dorg.kie.server.location=http://localhost:8230/kie-server/services/rest/server
----

If the {CENTRAL} port is 8080, as in this example, then the {KIE_SERVER} port, with a defined offset of 150, is 8230.
====

{KIE_SERVER} connects to the new {CENTRAL} and collects the list of deployment units (KIE containers) to be deployed.


[NOTE]
====
When you use a class inside a dependency JAR file to access {KIE_SERVER} from {KIE_SERVER} client, you get the `ConversionException` and `ForbiddenClassException` in {CENTRAL}.
To avoid generating these exceptions in {CENTRAL}, do one of the following:

* If the exceptions are generated on the client-side, add following system property to the kie-server client:
[source]
----
System.setProperty("org.kie.server.xstream.enabled.packages", "org.example.**");
----
* If the exceptions are generated on the server-side, open `standalone-full.xml` from the {PRODUCT} installation directory, set the following property under the <system-properties> tag:
[source]
----
<property name="org.kie.server.xstream.enabled.packages" value="org.example.**"/>
----
* Set the following JVM property:
[source]
----
-Dorg.kie.server.xstream.enabled.packages=org.example.**
----
It is expected that you do not configure the classes that exists in KJAR using these system property. Ensure that only known classes are used in the system property to avoid any vulnerabilities.

The `org.example` is an example package, you can define any package that you want to use. You can specify multiple packages separated by comma , for example,
`org.example1.* * , org.example2.* * , org.example3.* *`.

You can also add specific classes , for example, `org.example1.Mydata1, org.example2.Mydata2`.
