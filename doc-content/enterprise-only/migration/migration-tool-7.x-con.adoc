{PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} contains a modified data structure and other feature changes that do not support a direct data migration from {PRODUCT_OLD}. Therefore, Red Hat provides a {CENTRAL} migration tool that enables you to migrate project data and configurations from {PRODUCT_OLD} to {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}. You can run the migration tool on the `.niogit` directory of your {CENTRAL} distribution or on an external Git repository. The migration tool prepares your {CENTRAL} data for the new data structure and features supported in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}.
