= Importing data objects

*Test Scenario (Preview)* editor will load all data objects that are located in the same package as the test scenario. You can view the the data objects by expanding *DATA OBJECTS* in *Project Explorer*. The loaded data objects are also displayed in the *Test Editor* tab in the *Test Tools* panel.

You need to close and reopen the preview editor in case the data objects change (for example, when a new data object is created or when an existing one is deleted). Select a data object from the list to display its fields and their types.
