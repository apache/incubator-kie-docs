= Importing data objects

*Test Scenario (Preview)* editor loads all data objects that are located in the same package as the test scenario. You can view all the data objects from the *Data Objects* tab in the editor. The loaded data objects are also displayed in the *Test Editor* tab in the *Test Tools* panel.

You need to close and reopen the preview editor in case the data objects change (for example, when a new data object is created or when an existing one is deleted). Select a data object from the list to display its fields and the field types.

In case you want to use a data object located in a different package than the test scenario, you need to import the data object first. Follow the procedure below to import a data object.

.Procedure
. Go to *Project Explorer* panel in the *Test Scenario (Preview)* editor.

. Select *Data Objects* tab and click *New Item*.
. In the *Add import* window, choose the data object from the drop-down list.
. Click *Ok* and then *Save*.
. Close and reopen the *Test Scenario (Preview)* editor to view the new data object from the data objects list.
