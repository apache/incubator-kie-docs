= Importing data objects using the Test Scenarios (Preview) editor

Test Scenarios (Preview) editor will load all data objects that are located in the same package as the test scenario. You can view the the data objects under *DATA OBJECTS* in the *Project Explorer* panel. The loaded data objects are also displayed in the *Test Editor* tab in the *Test Tools* panel.
