= Multiple branches in {CENTRAL}

Multiple branches support in {CENTRAL} provides the ability to create a new branch based on an existing one, including all of its assets. All new, imported, and sample projects open in the default *master* branch. You can create as many branches as you need and can work on multiple branches interchangeably without impacting the original project on the *master* branch.

{PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} includes support for persisting branches, which means that {CENTRAL} remembers the last branch used and will open in that branch when you log back in.
