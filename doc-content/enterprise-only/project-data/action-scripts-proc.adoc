= Defining an action script

Action scripts are code snippets that are associated with a script task. They specify the action of the script task. You can include global and process variables in your action scripts.

You can write action scripts in Java, JavaScript, and MVEL. Note that MVEL accepts any valid Java code and additionally provides support for nested access of parameters. For example, the MVEL equivalent of the Java call `person.getName()` is `person.name`. MVEL also provides other improvements over Java and MVEL expressions are generally more convenient for business users.
