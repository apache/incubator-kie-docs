= Project deployment in {CENTRAL}

You can use {CENTRAL} to develop your business assets and services and to manage {KIE_SERVERS} configured for project deployment. When your project is developed, you can build the project in {CENTRAL} and deploy it automatically to the {KIE_SERVER}. To enable automatic deployment, {CENTRAL} includes a built-in Maven repository. From {CENTRAL}, you can start, stop, or remove the deployment units (KIE containers) that contain the services and their project versions that you have built and deployed.

You can also connect several {KIE_SERVERS} to the same {CENTRAL} instance and group them into different server configurations (in *Menu* -> *Deploy* -> *Execution Servers*). Servers belonging to the same server configuration run the same services, but you can deploy different projects or different versions of projects on different configurations.

For example, you could have test servers in the `Test` configuration and production servers in a `Production` configuration. As you develop business assets and services in a project, you deploy the project on the `Test` server configuration and then, when a version of the project is sufficiently tested, you can deploy it on the `Production` server configuration. In this case, to keep developing the project, change the version in the project settings. Then the new version and the old version are seen as different artifacts in the built-in Maven repository. You can deploy the new version on the `Test` server configuration and keep running the old version on the  `Production` server configuration. This deployment process is simple but has significant limitations. Notably, there is not enough access control: a developer can deploy a project directly into a production environment.

IMPORTANT: You cannot move a {KIE_SERVER} into a different server configuration using {CENTRAL}. You must change the configuration file of the server to change the server configuration name for it.
