= Test scenarios

Test scenarios in {PRODUCT} enable you to validate the functionality of business rules and business rule data before deploying them into a production environment. With a test scenario, you use data from your project to set given conditions and expected results based on one or more defined business rules. When you run the scenario, the expected results and actual results of the rule instance are compared. If the expected results match the actual results, the test is successful. If the expected results do not match the actual results, then the test fails.

Test scenarios can be executed one at a time or as a group. The group execution contains all the scenarios from one package. Test scenarios are independent, so one scenario cannot affect or modify the other. You can run test scenarios at any time during project development in {CENTRAL}. You do not have to compile or deploy your decision service to run test scenarios.

All data objects related to a test scenario must be in the same project package as the test scenario. Assets in the same package are imported by default. After you create the necessary data objects and the test scenario, you can use the *Data Objects* tab of the test scenarios designer to verify that all required data objects are listed or to import other existing data objects by adding a *New item*.
