= Editing the GAV values for a project in {CENTRAL}

The `GroupId`, `ArtifactId`, and `Version` (GAV) values identify a project in a Maven repository. When {CENTRAL} and {KIE_SERVER} are on the same file system and use the same Maven repository, the project is automatically updated in the repository each time you build a new version of your project. However, if {CENTRAL} and {KIE_SERVER} are on separate file systems and use separate local Maven repositories, you must update a project GAV value, usually the version, for any new versions of the project to ensure that the project is seen as a different artifact alongside the old version.

NOTE: For development purposes only, you can toggle the *Development Mode* option in project *Settings* -> *General Settings* -> *Version* to add the `SNAPSHOT` suffix in the project version. This suffix instructs Maven to get a new snapshot update according to the Maven policy. Do not use *Development Mode* or manually add the `SNAPSHOT` version suffix for a production environment.

You can set the GAV values in the project *Settings* screen.

.Procedure
. In {CENTRAL}, go to *Menu* -> *Design* -> *Projects* and click the project name.
. Click the project *Settings* tab.
. In *General Settings*, modify the *Group ID*, *Artifact ID*, or *Version* fields as necessary. If you have deployed the project and are developing a new version, usually you need to increase the version number.
