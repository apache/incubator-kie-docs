= {PRODUCT} projects

{PRODUCT} projects contain the business assets that you develop in {PRODUCT} and are assigned to a space (for example, `MyProject` within `MySpace`). Projects also contain configuration files such as a Maven project object model file (`pom.xml`), which contains build, environment, and other information about the project, and a KIE module descriptor file (`kmodule.xml`), which contains the KIE Base and KIE Session configurations for the assets in the project.
