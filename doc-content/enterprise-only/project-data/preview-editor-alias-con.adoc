= Concept of aliases

In the Test Scenario (Preview) editor, once you map a header cell with a data object, the data object is removed from the *Test Editor* tab in the *Test Tools* panel. But you can still re-map a data object to another header cell by using the concept of *Alias*. You simply need rename (by using an alias name) for the header cell. By doing so, the data object is again available in the *Test Editor* tab for remapping.
