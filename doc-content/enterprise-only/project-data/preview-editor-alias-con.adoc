= Concept of aliases

In the Test Scenario (Preview) editor, once you map a header cell with a data object, the data object is removed from the *Test Editor* tab in the *Test Tools* panel. You can re-map a data object to another header cell by using the concept of *Alias*. Aliases enable you to specify multiple instances of the same data object. Ensure that the aliases are uniquely named. By doing so, the data object again becomes available in the *Test Editor* tab for remapping.
