= Creating a project using archetypes

Archetypes are projects that are installed in Apache Maven repositories and contain a specific template structure. You can also generate parameterized versions of the project templates using archetypes. When you use an archetype to create a project, it is added to the Git repository that is connected to your {PRODUCT} installation.

.Prerequisites
* You have created an archetype and added it to the *Archetypes* page in the {CENTRAL} *Settings*. For information about creating archetypes, see the https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-creating-archetypes.html[Guide to Creating Archetypes].

* You have set a default archetype in your space in {CENTRAL}.

For more information about archetypes management, see {URL_MANAGING_SETTINGS}#assembly-configuring-central[_{CONFIGURING_CENTRAL}_].

.Procedure
. In {CENTRAL}, go to *Menu* -> *Design* -> *Projects*.
. Select or create the space into which you want to add a new project from an archetype template.
. Click *Add Project*.
. Type the project name and description in the *Name* and *Description* fields.
. Click *Configure Advanced Options*.
. Select the *Based on template* checkbox.
. Select the archetype from drop-down options if required. The default archetype is selected that is already set in the space.
. Click *Add*.

The Assets view of the project opens based on the selected archetype template.
