= Duplicate GAV detection in {CENTRAL}

In {CENTRAL}, all Maven repositories are checked for any duplicated `GroupId`, `ArtifactId`, and `Version` (GAV) values in a project. If a GAV duplicate exists, the performed operation is canceled.

NOTE: Duplicate GAV detection is disabled for projects in *Development Mode*. To enable duplicate GAV detection in {CENTRAL}, go to project *Settings* -> *General Settings* -> *Version* and toggle the *Development Mode* option to *OFF* (if applicable).

Duplicate GAV detection is executed every time you perform the following operations:

* Save a project definition for the project.
* Save the `pom.xml` file.
* Install, build, or deploy a project.

The following Maven repositories are checked for duplicate GAVs:

* Repositories specified in the `<repositories>` and `<distributionManagement>` elements of the `pom.xml` file.
* Repositories specified in the Maven `settings.xml` configuration file.
