= KIE base attributes supported in KIE modules

A KIE base is a repository that you define in the KIE module descriptor file (`kmodule.xml`) for your project and contains all
ifdef::DM[]
rules and other business assets
endif::DM[]
ifdef::PAM[]
rules, processes, and other business assets
endif::PAM[]
in {PRODUCT}. When you define KIE bases in the `kmodule.xml` file, you can specify certain attributes and values to further customize your KIE base configuration.

.Example KIE base configuration in a `kmodule.xml` file
[source,xml]
----
<kmodule>
  ...
  <kbase name="KBase2" default="false" eventProcessingMode="stream" equalsBehavior="equality" declarativeAgenda="enabled" packages="org.domain.pkg2, org.domain.pkg3" includes="KBase1">
    ...
  </kbase>
  ...
</kmodule>

The following are the `kbase` attributes and values supported in the KIE module descriptor file (`kmodule.xml`) for your project:

.KIE base attributes supported in KIE modules
[cols="30%,30%,40%", options="header"]
|===
|Attribute
|Supported values
|Description

|`name`
|Any name
|Defines the name that retrieves `KieBase` from `KieContainer`. _This attribute is mandatory_.

|`includes`
|Comma-separated list of other KIE base objects in the KIE module
|Defines other KIE base objects and artifacts to be included in this KIE base. A KIE base can be contained in multiple KIE modules if you declare it as a dependency in the `pom.xml` file of the modules.

|`packages`
a|Comma-separated list of packages to include in the KIE base

Default: `all`
|Defines packages of artifacts (such as rules and processes) to be included in this KIE base. By default, all artifacts in the `~/resources` directory are included into a KIE base. This attribute enables you to limit the number of compiled artifacts. Only the packages belonging to the list specified in this attribute are compiled.

|`default`
a|`true`, `false`

Default: `false`
|Determines whether a KIE base is the default KIE base for a module so that it can be created from the KIE container without passing any name. Each module can have only one default KIE base.

|`equalsBehavior`
a|`identity`, `equality`

Default: `identity`
|Defines the behavior of {PRODUCT} when a new fact is inserted into the working memory. If set to `identity`, a new `FactHandle` is always created unless the same object is already present in the working memory. If set to `equality`, a new `FactHandle` is created only if the newly inserted object is not equal, according to its `equals()` method, to an existing fact.

|`eventProcessingMode`
a|`cloud`, `stream`

Default: `cloud`
|Determines how events are processed in the KIE base. If this property is set to `cloud`, the KIE base treats events as normal facts. If this property is set to `stream`, temporal reasoning on events is allowed.

|`declarativeAgenda`
a|`disabled`, `enabled`

Default: `disabled`
|Determines whether the declarative agenda is enabled or not.
