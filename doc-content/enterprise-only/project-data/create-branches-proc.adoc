= Creating branches
You can create new branches in {CENTRAL} and name them whatever you like. Initially, you will only have the default *master* branch. When you create a new branch for a project, you are making a copy of the selected branch. You can make changes to the project on the new branch without impacting the original *master* branch version.

.Procedure
. In {CENTRAL}, go to *Menu* -> *Design* -> *Projects*.
. Click on the project to create the new branch, for example the *{PROJECT}* sample project.
. Click *master* -> *Add Branch*.

. Type `testBranch1` in the *Name* field and select *master* from the *Add Branch* window. Where `testBranch1` is any name that you want to name the new branch.
. Select the branch that will be the base for the new branch from the *Add Branch* window. This can be any existing branch.
. Click *Add*.

.Add the new branch window

After adding the new branch, you will be redirected to it, and it will contain all of the assets that you had in your project in the *master* branch.
