= Creating branches
You can create new branches in {CENTRAL} and name them whatever you like. Initially, you will only have the default *master* branch. When you create a new branch for a project, you are making a copy of the selected branch and all of its assets. You can make changes to the project on the new branch without impacting the original *master* branch version.

.Procedure
. Log in to {CENTRAL} and click *Menu* -> *Design* -> *Projects*.
. Click on the project to create the new branch, for example the *Mortgage Process* sample project.
. Click *master* -> *Add Branch*.
+
.Create the new branch menu

. Click *Add*.
+
.Add the new branch window

After adding the new branch, you will be redirected to it, and it will contain all of the assets that you had in your project in the *master* branch.
