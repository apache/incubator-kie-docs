= Creating branches
You can create new branches in {CENTRAL} and name them whatever you like. Initially, you will only have the default *master* branch. When you create a new branch for a project, you are making a copy of the selected branch and all of its assets. You can make changes to the project on the new branch without impacting the original *master* branch version.

.Procedure
. Log in to {CENTRAL} and click *Menu* -> *Design* -> *Projects*.
. Click on the project to create the new branch, for example the *{PROJECT}* sample project.
. Click *master* -> *Add Branch*.

. Select the branch that will be the base for the new branch from the *From* pull-down menu. This can be any existing branch.
. Click *Add*.

After adding the new branch, you will be redirected to it, and it will contain all of the assets that you had in your project in the *master* branch.
