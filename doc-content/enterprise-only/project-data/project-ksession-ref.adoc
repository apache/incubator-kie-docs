= KIE session attributes supported in KIE modules

A KIE session stores and executes runtime data and is created from a KIE base or directly from a KIE container if you have defined the KIE session in the KIE module descriptor file (`kmodule.xml`) for your project. When you define KIE bases and KIE sessions in the `kmodule.xml` file, you can specify certain attributes and values to further customize your KIE session configuration.

The following are the `ksession` attributes and values supported in the KIE module descriptor file (`kmodule.xml`) for your project:

.KIE session attributes supported in KIE modules
[cols="30%,30%,40%", options="header"]
|===
|Attribute
|Supported values
|Description

|`name`
|Any name
|Defines the name that retrieves `KieSession` from `KieContainer`. _This attribute is mandatory_.

|`type`
a|`stateful`, `stateless`

Default: `stateful`
|Determines whether data is retained (`stateful`) or discarded (`stateless`) between invocations of the KIE session. A session set to `stateful` enables you to iteratively work with the working memory, while a session set to `stateless` is typically used for one-off execution of assets. A `stateless` session stores a knowledge state that is changed every time a new fact is added, updated, or deleted, and every time a rule is executed. An execution in a `stateless` session has no information about previous actions, such rule executions.

|`default`
a|`true`, `false`

Default: `false`
|Determines whether a KIE session is the default session for a module so that it can be created from the KIE container without passing any name. Each module can have only one default KIE session.

|`clockType`
a|`realtime`, `pseudo`

Default: `realtime`
|Determines whether event time stamps are assigned by the system clock or by a pseudo clock controlled by the application. This clock is especially useful for unit testing on temporal rules.

|`beliefSystem`
a|`simple`, `jtms`, `defeasible`

Default: `simple`
|Defines the type of belief system used by the KIE session. A belief system deduces the truth from knowledge (facts). For example, if a new fact is inserted based on another fact which is later removed from the {DECISION_ENGINE}, the system can determine that the newly inserted fact should be removed as well.
