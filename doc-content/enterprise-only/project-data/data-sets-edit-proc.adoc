= Editing data sets

You can edit existing data sets to ensure that the data fetched to the reporting components is up-to-date.

.Procedure
. In {CENTRAL}, go to *Admin* -> *Data Sets*. The *Data Set Explorer* page opens.
. In the *Data Set Explorer* pane, search for the data set you want to edit and click *Edit*.
. In the *Data Set Editor* pane, use the appropriate tab to edit the data as required. The tabs differ based on the data set provider type you chose.
+
For example, the following changes are applicable for editing a *CSV* data provider:
+
* *CSV Configuration:* Enables you to change the name of the data set definition, the source file, the separator, and other properties.
* *Preview:* Enables you to preview the data. After you click *Test* in the *CSV Configuration* tab, the system executes the data set lookup call and if the data is available, a preview appears. Note that the *Preview* tab has two sub-tabs:
** *Data columns:* Enables you to specify what columns are part of your data set definition.
** *Filter:* Enables you to add a new filter.
* *Advanced:* Enables you to manage the following configurations:
** *Caching:* See <<data_sets_caching_con>> for more information.
** *Cache life-cycle* Enables you to specify an interval of time after which a data set (or data) is refreshed. The *Refresh on stale data* feature refreshes the cached data when the back-end data changes.
. After making the required changes, click *Validate*.
. Click *Save*.
