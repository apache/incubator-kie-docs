A data set is a collection of related sets of information. It can be stored in many ways, such as in a database, in a Microsoft Excel file, or in memory. A data set definition instructs {CENTRAL} methods to access, read, and parse a data set. {CENTRAL} does not store data. It enables you to define access to a data set regardless of where the data is stored.

For example, if data is stored in a database, a valid data set could contain the entire database or a subset of the database as a result of an SQL query. In both cases, the data is used as input for the reporting components of {CENTRAL} which then displays the information.

To access a data set, you must create and register a data set definition. This data set definition specifies the location of the data set, the ways to access it, read it, and parse it, and the columns that it contains.
