= Importing projects from Git repositories
Git is a distributed version control system. It implements revisions as commit objects. When you save your changes to a repository, a new commit object in the Git repository is created.

{CENTRAL} uses Git to store project data, including assets such as rules and processes. When you create a project in {CENTRAL}, it is added to a Git repository that is connected to {CENTRAL}. If you have projects in Git repositories, you can import the project's master branch or import the master branch along with other specific branches into the {CENTRAL} Git repository through {CENTRAL} spaces.

.Prerequisites
* {PRODUCT} projects exist in an external Git repository.
* You have the credentials required for read access to that external Git repository.

.Procedure
. In {CENTRAL}, go to *Menu* -> *Design* -> *Projects*.
. Select or create the space into which you want to import the projects. The default space is *MySpace*.
. Click the three dots image:project-data/dots.png[] icon on the right side of the screen and select *Import Project*.
. In the *Import Project* window, enter the URL and credentials for the Git repository that contains the project that you want to import and click *Import*. The *Import Projects* page is displayed.
. Optional: To import master and specific branches, do the following tasks:
.. On the *Import Projects* page, click the branches image:project-data/branch-icon.png[] icon.
.. In the *Branches to be imported* window, select branches from the list.
+
NOTE: You must select the master branch as a minimum.

.. Click *Ok*.
