= Variables

Variables store data that is used during runtime. Process designer uses three types of variables:

.Global variables
Global variables are visible to all process instances and assets in a particular session. They are intended to be used primarily by business rules and by constraints and are created dynamically by rules or constraints.

.Process variables
Process variables are defined as properties in the BPMN2 definition file and are visible within the process instance. They are initialized at process creation and destroyed on process completion.

.Local variables
Local variables are associated with and available within specific process elements, such as activities. They are initialized when the element context is initialized, that is, when the execution workflow enters the node and execution of the `onEntry` action has finished, if applicable. They are destroyed when the element context is destroyed, that is, when the execution workflow leaves the element.

An element, such as a process, sub-process, or task can only access variables in its own and parent contexts. An element cannot access a variable defined in the element's child element. Therefore, when an elements requires access to a variable during runtime, its own context is searched first.

If the variable cannot be found directly in the element's context, the immediate parent context is searched. The search continues until the process context is reached. In case of global variables, the search is performed directly on the session container.

If the variable cannot be found, a read access request returns `null` and a write access produces an error message, and the process continues its execution.
Variables are searched for based on their ID.

== Defining global variables
Global variables exist in a knowledge session and can be accessed and are shared by all assets in that session. They belong to the particular session of the Knowledge Base and they are used to pass information to the engine. Every global variable defines its ID and item subject reference. The ID serves as the variable name and must be unique within the process definition. The item subject reference defines the data type the variable stores.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The rules are evaluated at the moment the fact is inserted.
Therefore, if you are using a global variable to constrain a fact pattern and the global is not set, the system returns a ``NullPointerException``.
====

Global variables are initialized either when the process with the variable definition is added to the session or when the session is initialized with globals as its parameters.

Values of global variables can typically be changed during the assignment, which is a mapping between a process variable and an activity variable. The global variable is then associated with the local activity context, local activity variable, or by a direct call to the variable from a child context.

.Prerequisites
* You have created a project in {CENTRAL} and it contains at least one business process asset.

.Procedure
. Open a business process asset.
. Click a blank area of the process designer canvas.
. Click the *Properties* icon on the upper-right side of the screen to open the *Properties* panel.
. If necessary, expand the *Process* section.
. In the *Global Variables* sub-section, click the plus icon.
. Enter a name for the variable in the *Name* box.
. Select a data type from the *Data Type* menu.

== Defining process variables
Process variables are defined as properties in the BPMN2 definition file and are visible within the process instance. They are initialized at process creation and destroyed on process completion.

A process variable is a variable that exists in a process context and can be accessed by its process or its child elements. Process variables belong to a particular process instance and cannot be accessed by other process instances.
Every process variable defines its ID and item subject reference: the ID serves as the variable name and must be unique within the process definition.
The item subject reference defines the data type the variable stores.

Process variables are initialized when the process instance is created. Their value can be changed by the process activities using the Assignment, when the global variable is associated with the local Activity context, local Activity variable, or by a direct call to the variable from a child context.

Note that process variables should be mapped to local variables.

.Prerequisites
* You have created a project in {CENTRAL} and it contains at least one business process asset.

.Procedure
. Open a business process asset.
. Click a blank area of the process designer canvas.
. Click the *Properties* icon on the upper-right side of the screen to open the *Properties* panel.
. If necessary, expand the *Process Data* section.
. In the *Process Variables* sub-section, click the plus icon.
. Enter a name for the variable in the *Name* box.
. Select a data type from the *Data Type* menu.

== Defining local variables
Local variables are available within their process element, such as an activity. They are initialized when the element context is initialized, that is, when the execution workflow enters the node and execution of the `onEntry` action has finished, if applicable. They are destroyed when the element context is destroyed, that is, when the execution workflow leaves the element.

Values of local variables can be mapped to global or process variables. This enables you to maintain relative independence of the parent element that accommodates the local variable. Such isolation might help prevent technical exceptions.

A local variable is a variable that exists in a child element context of a process and can be accessed only from within this context. Local variables belong to the particular element of a process.

For tasks, with the exception of the Script task, you can define [property]``Data Input Assignments`` and [property]``Data Output Assignments`` in the *Assignments* property. Data Input Assignment defines variables that enter the Task and therefore provide the entry data needed for the task execution. The Data Output Assignments can refer to the context of the Task after execution to acquire output data.

User Tasks present data related to the actor that is executing the User Task. Additionally, User Tasks also request the actor to provide result data related to the execution.

To request and provide the data, use task forms and map the data in the Data Input Assignment parameter to a variable. Map the data provided by the user in the Data Output Assignment parameter if you want to preserve the data as output.

.Prerequisites
* You have created a project in {CENTRAL} and it contains at least one business process asset that has at least one task that is not a script task.

.Procedure
. Open a business process asset.
. Select a task that is not a script task.
. Click the *Properties* icon on the upper-right side of the screen to open the *Properties* panel.
. If necessary, expand the *Data Assignments* section.
. Click the box under the *Assignments* sub-section. The *Task Data I/O* dialog box opens.
. Click *Add* next to *Data Inputs and Assignments* or *Data Inputs and Assignments*.
. Enter a name for the local variable in the *Name* box.
. Select a data type from the *Data Type* menu.
. Select a source or target then click *Save*.
