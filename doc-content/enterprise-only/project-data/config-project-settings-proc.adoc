= Configuring project settings

Starting with {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}, {CENTRAL} contains additional project setting categories in the new process designer.

.Prerequisites
* You have created a {CENTRAL} project.

.Procedure
. To access the project *Settings* tab, in {CENTRAL} go to *Menu* -> *Design* -> *Projects*.
. Click the project name.
. Click *Settings* to view or modify the following project settings:

* *General Settings* - Enables users to set the project's *Name*, *Description*, *Group ID*, *Artifact ID*, *Version* (GAV), and *Development Mode* attributes. It also includes the following options:
** *URL* - Use to specify a read-only URL for cloning a project as a git repository.
** *Disable GAV conflict check* - Determines whether to enable or disable the GAV conflict check. Disabling this feature enables projects to have the same GAV values.
** *Allow child GAV edition* - Allows GAV editions for sub-projects.

* *Dependencies* - Used to add dependencies either manually, by entering the *Group ID*, *Artifact ID*, and *Version* or from a repository project in {CENTRAL}. For each dependency, set select *All* or *None* for the *Package white list* option.

* *External Data Objects* - Data objects are not explicitly defined within a project or project dependencies that a rule author may require. External data objects are usually provided by the Java runtime, for example, `java.util.List`.

* *Validation* - Maven repositories that are used to check the uniqueness of a project's GAV when creating a new project or module or when installing or deploying a project to a Maven repository.
