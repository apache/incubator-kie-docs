= Modifying existing projects in {CENTRAL}

{CENTRAL} includes a number of sample projects that you can use to get familiar with the product and its features. The sample projects have been designed and created to demonstrate a variety of business scenarios. You can modify the sample projects to meet your specific business needs. For example, {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} contains the *{PROJECT}* sample project, which consists of predefined data objects, guided decision tables, guided rules, forms, and a business process. You can edit the sample to refine your business process.

If none of the existing {CENTRAL} project samples align with your requirements, you can create a new project or import one from a Git repository. For more information, see xref:git-import-project[]. You can import any other project from Git. For example, a project that was developed in another {CENTRAL} instance.
