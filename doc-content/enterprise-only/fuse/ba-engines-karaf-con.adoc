= {PRODUCT} decision and process engines with {FUSE} on Apache Karaf

Apache Karaf is a polymorphic standalone open-source container. It is based on the OSGi standard from the OSGi Alliance. Karaf provides support for modularisation through OSGi bundles with sophisticated class-loading support. You can deploy multiple versions of a dependency side by side in a Karaf container. You can use hot code swapping to upgrade or replace a module without shutting down the container.

Install {PRODUCT} features on Karaf to create a dynamic runtime environment for your {PRODUCT} processes.
