Apache Karaf is a standalone open-source runtime environment. It is based on the OSGi standard from the OSGi Alliance. Karaf provides support for modularisation through OSGi bundles with sophisticated class-loading support. You can deploy multiple versions of a dependency side by side in a Karaf container. You can use hot code swapping to upgrade or replace a module without shutting down the container.

{PRODUCT} integration with {FUSE} on Karaf is provided through Karaf features. You can install individual components of {PRODUCT} for {FUSE} on Karaf using these features.

Features files are XML files that specify which OSGI bundles are installed for a particular feature. The following features XML files facilitate {PRODUCT} and {FUSE} on Karaf integration:

* `rhba-features-<FUSE-VERSION>-features.xml`
+
This file is a part of {FUSE} installed in Karaf where `<FUSE-VERSION>` is the version of Fuse. This file is stored in the Karaf system repository, in the `system/org/jboss/fuse/features/rhba-features` directory. This file contains prerequisites for installing {PRODUCT} features.

* `kie-karaf-features-{MAVEN_ARTIFACT_VERSION}-features-fuse.xml`
+
This file is a part of {PRODUCT} and provides {PRODUCT} features, which define the OSGi features that can be deployed into {FUSE_LONG}. OSGi users can install features from this file to install {PRODUCT} into {FUSE} and use it in their applications. You can find this features file in the online and offline Maven repository that is distributed with {PRODUCT}. The group ID, artifact ID, and version (GAV) identifier of this file is `org.kie:kie-karaf-features:{MAVEN_ARTIFACT_VERSION}`.
