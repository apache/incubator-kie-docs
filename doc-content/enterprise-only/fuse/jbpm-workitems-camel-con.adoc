= The `jbpm-workitems-camel` component

Comment: Maciej, thank you for this section. I suspect that it should be incorporated in chapter 4.1. There appears to be a mapping with the items you list here with the GUI lables on the Service Task Admin page. For example `CXFCamelWorkitemHandler`/CamelCXFConnector.

The `jbpm-workitems-camel` component provides a set of integration-focused work item handlers backed by Apache Camel. These are primarily used for performing integrations from within processes, for example sending web service requests or JMS messages.

The following work item handlers are available out of the box:

* `CXFCamelWorkitemHandler`
* `FTPCamelWorkitemHandler`
* `FTPSCamelWorkitemHandler`
* `FileCamelWorkitemHandler`
* `JMSCamelWorkitemHandler`
* `SQLCamelWorkitemHandler`
* `XSLTCamelWorkitemHandler`

You can configure these work item handlers through the {CENTRAL} *Service Task Administration* and *Project Settings* pages.

Note: Service tasks can only be installed into the project after they are globally enabled (in service task administration).
