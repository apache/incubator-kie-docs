[id='kie-camel-con_{context}']
= The `kie-camel` component

The `kie-camel` component is an Apache Camel endpoint provided by {FUSE_LONG} that integrates {FUSE} with {PRODUCT}.  It enables you to specify a {PRODUCT} module by using a Maven group ID, artifact ID, and version (GAV) identifier which you can pull into the route and execute. It also enables you to specify portions of the message body as facts. You can use the `kie-camel` component with embedded engines or with {KIE_SERVER}.

.Embedded engines
In this scenario, KIE engines run in the same container as the {FUSE} integration project and you can communicate with engines using KIE commands. To create the Camel producer, use the following URI:
[source]
----
kie-local:kie-session-name?action=execute
----

For example, enter the following command to initialize a Camel route in Spring:

[source]
----
<from uri="direct:runCommand" />
  	<to uri="kie-local:kie-session1?action=execute"/>
----

.{KIE_SERVER}
In this scenario, the `kie-camel` component connects to {KIE_SERVER} using the {KIE_SERVER} REST API. This enables users to communicate with {KIE_SERVER} using the {KIE_SERVER} API. To create a producer, use the following URI:

[source]
----
kie:http://username:password@kie-server-url`
----

For example, enter the following command to initialize a Camel route in Spring:

[source]
----
<from uri="direct:runCommand" />
  	<to uri="kie:http://user:psswd@localhost:8080/kie-server-services/services/rest/server"/>
----

The message has the following headers:
