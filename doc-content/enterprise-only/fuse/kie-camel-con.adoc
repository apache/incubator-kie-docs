= The `kie-camel` component

The `kie-camel` component is an Apache Camel endpoint provided by {FUSE_LONG} that integrates {FUSE} with {PRODUCT}.  It enables you to specify a {PRODUCT} module by using a Maven group ID, artifact, and version (GAV)  which you can pull into the route and execute. It also enables you to specify portions of the message body as facts.You can use the `kie-camel` component with embedded engines or with {KIE_SERVER}.

.Embedded engines
In this scenario, KIE engines run in the same container as the {FUSE} integration project and you can communicate with engines using Kie commands. To create the Camel producer, use following URI:
[source]
----
kie-local:kie-session-name?action=execute
----

For example you can initialize Camel route using following example in Spring:
<from uri="direct:runCommand" />
  	<to uri="kie-local:kie-session1?action=execute"/>

.{KIE_SERVER}
In this scenario kie-camel component connects to kie-server using kie-server REST API and allows user to communicate with kie-server using kie server API. To create producer use following URI: “kie:http://username:password@kie-server-url”.
For example you can initialize Camel route using following example in Spring:
<from uri="direct:runCommand" />
  	<to uri="kie:http://user:psswd@localhost:8080/kie-server-services/services/rest/server"/>
