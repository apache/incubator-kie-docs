= Installing {PRODUCT} features on Karaf through maven
Install {PRODUCT} with {FUSE} on Apache Karaf to deploy integrated services where required.

.Prerequisites
* A {FUSE_LONG} {FUSE_VERSION} on Apache Karaf installation exists. For installation instructions, see  https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_fuse/{FUSE_VERSION}/html-single/installing_on_apache_karaf/[_Installing Red Hat Fuse on the Apache Karaf container_] .
* Any obsolete features XML files have been removed, as described in <<ba-karaf-xml-uninstall-proc>>.

.Procedure

. Make sure that the `\https://maven.repository.redhat.com/ga/` repository is present in the `org.ops4j.pax.url.mvn.repositories` variable and add it if necessary.
+
[NOTE]
====
Separate entries in the `org.ops4j.pax.url.mvn.repositories` variable with a comma, space, and backslash (`, \`). The backslash forces a new line.
