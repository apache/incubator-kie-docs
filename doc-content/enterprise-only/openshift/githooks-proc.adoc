= Providing the Git hooks directory

If you configure the `GIT_HOOKS_DIR` parameter, you must provide a directory of Git hooks and must mount this directory on the {CENTRAL} deployment. 

The typical use of Git hooks is interaction with an upstream repository. To enable Git hooks to push commits into an upstream repository, you must also provide a secret key that corresponds to a public key configured on the upstream repository.

.Procedure

. If pushing commits to an upstream repository is required, complete the following steps to enable access to the repository:
.. Create a pair of a secret key named `id_rsa` and public key named `id_rsa.pub`. Use an email address that can access the upstream repository. Set an empty passphrase. For instructions, see https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/#generating-a-new-ssh-key[Generating a new SSH key]. 
.. Upload the public key to the upstream repository.
.. Create an OpenShift secret named `{PRODUCT_INIT}-centr-gitkey` from the secret key:
+
[subs="attributes,verbatim,macros"]
----
oc create secret generic --from-file=id_rsa=id_rsa {PRODUCT_INIT}-centr-gitkey
----
+
.. Mount the secret in the ssh key path of the {CENTRAL} deployment:
+
[subs="attributes,verbatim,macros"]
----
oc set volume dc/<myapp>-{PRODUCT_INIT}centr --add --type secret --secret-name {PRODUCT_INIT}-centr-gitkey --mount-path=/home/jboss/.ssh --name=ssh-key
----
+
Where `<myapp>` is the application name that was set when configuring the template. 
+
. Create the Git hooks directory. For instructions, see the https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks[Git hooks reference documentation].
+
For example, a simple git hooks directory can provide a post-commit hook that pushes the changes upstream. If the project was imported into {CENTRAL} from a repository, this repository remains configured as the upstream repository. Create a file named `post-commit` with permission values `755` and the following content:
+
[subs="attributes,verbatim,macros"]
----
git push
----
+
. Supply the Git hooks directory to the {CENTRAL} deployment. You can use a configuration map or a persistent volume.
.. If the Git hooks consist of one or several fixed script files, use a configuration map. Complete the following steps:
... Change into the Git hooks directory that you have created.
... Create an OpenShift configuration map from the files in the directory. Run the following command:
+
[subs="attributes,verbatim,macros"]
----
oc create configmap git_hooks --from-file=<file_1>=<file_1> --from-file=<file_2>=<file_2> ...
----
+
Where `file_1`, `file_2` and so on are git hook script files. Example:
+
[subs="attributes,verbatim,macros"]
----
oc create configmap git_hooks --from-file=post-commit=post-commit
----
+
... Mount the configuration map on the {CENTRAL} deployment in the path that you have configured:
+
[subs="attributes,verbatim,macros"]
----
oc set volume dc/<myapp>-{PRODUCT_INIT}centr --add --type configmap --configmap-name git_hooks  --mount-path=<git_hooks_dir> --name=git_hooks
----
+
Where `<myapp>` is the application name that was set when configuring the template and `<git_hooks_dir>` is the value of `GIT_HOOKS_DIR` that was set when configuring the template.
+
.. If the Git hooks consist of long files or depend on binaries, such as executable or KJAR files, use a persistence volume. You must create a persistent volume, create a persistent volume claim and associate the volume with the claim, transfer files to the volume, and mount the volume in the `_myapp_-{PRODUCT_INIT}centr` deployment configuration (where _myapp_ is the application name). For instructions about creating and mounting persistence volumes, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/3.11/html/developer_guide/dev-guide-persistent-volumes[Using persistent volumes]. For instructions about copying files onto a persistent volume, see https://blog.openshift.com/transferring-files-in-and-out-of-containers-in-openshift-part-3/[Transferring files in and out of containers].
+
. Wait a few minutes, then review the list and status of pods in yor project. Because {CENTRAL} does not start until you provide the Git hooks directory, the {KIE_SERVER} might not start at all. To see if it has started, check the output of the following command:
+
[subs="attributes,verbatim,macros"]
----
oc get pods
----
+
If a working {KIE_SERVER} pod is not present, start it:
+
[subs="attributes,verbatim,macros"]
----
oc rollout latest dc/<myapp>-kieserver
----
+
Where `<myapp>` is the application name that was set when configuring the template.
