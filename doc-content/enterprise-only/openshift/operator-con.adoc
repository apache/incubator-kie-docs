= Deployment and management of a {PRODUCT} environment using OpenShift operators

To deploy a {PRODUCT} environment, the OpenShift operator uses a YAML source that describes the environment. {PRODUCT} provides an installer that you can use to form the YAML source and deploy the environment.

When the Business Automation operator deploys the environment, it creates a YAML description of the environment, and then ensures that the environment is consistent with the description at all times. You can edit the description to modify the environment.

You can remove the environment by deleting the operator application in {OPENSHIFT}.

[NOTE]
====
When you remove an environment with a high-availability {CENTRAL}, the operator does not delete Persistent Volume Claims that were created as part of the JBoss Datagrid and JBoss AMQ StatefulSet creation. This behaviour is a part of Kubernetes design, as deletion of the Persistent Volume Claims could cause data loss. For more information about handling persistent volumes during deletion of a StatefulSet, see the https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/delete-stateful-set/#persistent-volumes[Kubernetes documentation].

If you create a new environment using the same namespace and the same application name, the environment reuses the persistent volumes for increased performance.

You can delete the Persistent Volume Claims manually.
