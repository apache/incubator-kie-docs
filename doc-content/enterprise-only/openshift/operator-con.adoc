= Deploying and managing a {PRODUCT} environment using OpenShift Operators

To deploy a {PRODUCT} environment using OpenShift Operators, you must provide settings for the environment as a YAML source.

When {OPENSHIFT} deploys the environment, it creates a YAML description of the environment, and then ensures that the environment is coherent with the description at all times. You can edit the description to modify the environment.
