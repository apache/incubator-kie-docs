= Deploying an immutable {KIE_SERVER} from KJAR services

To deploy an immutable {KIE_SERVER} from KJAR services,
ifdef::DM[]
use the `{PRODUCT_INIT}{ENTERPRISE_VERSION_SHORT}-kieserver.yaml` template file. You can extract this file 
endif::DM[]
ifdef::PAM[]
use one of the following template files:

* `{PRODUCT_INIT}{ENTERPRISE_VERSION_SHORT}-kieserver-postgresql.yaml` to use a PostgreSQL pod for persistent storage. Use this template unless there is a sufficient reason to use another template.

* `{PRODUCT_INIT}{ENTERPRISE_VERSION_SHORT}-kieserver-mysql.yaml` to use a MySQL pod for persistent storage. 

* `{PRODUCT_INIT}{ENTERPRISE_VERSION_SHORT}-kieserver-externaldb.yaml` to use an external database server for persistent storage.
+
IMPORTANT: The standard {KIE_SERVER} image for an external database server includes drivers for MySQL and PostgreSQL external database servers. If you want to use another database server, you must build a custom {KIE_SERVER} image. For instructions, see <<externaldb-build-proc>>.

You can extract these template files 
endif::PAM[]
from the `{PRODUCT_FILE}-openshift-templates.zip` product deliverable file. You can download the file from the {PRODUCT_DOWNLOAD_LINK}[Software Downloads] page of the Red Hat Customer Portal.

In this method of deployment, the {KIE_SERVER} retrieves all the required KJAR files during the startup of the pod.

ifdef::PAM[]
You can configure the {KIE_SERVER} to connect to Smart Router and to {LOCAL_CENTRAL}. If you use the server with {LOCAL_CENTRAL}, you must ensure that the same versions of KJAR files are uploaded to the Maven repository that the {LOCAL_CENTRAL} instance uses.

endif::PAM[]
.Procedure

. Use one of the following methods to deploy the template:
* In the OpenShift Web UI, select *Add to Project -> Import YAML / JSON* and then select or paste the template file.
In the *Add Template* window, ensure *Process the template* is selected and click *Continue*.
* To use the OpenShift command line console, prepare the following command line:
+
[subs="attributes,verbatim,macros"]
----
oc new-app -f <template-path>/<template-file-name>.yaml -p KIE_SERVER_HTTPS_SECRET=kieserver-app-secret
----
+
In this command line:
+
** Replace `<template-path>` with the path to the template file.
** Replace `<template-file-name>` with the name of the template file.
** Use as many `-p PARAMETER=value` pairs as needed to set the required parameters. You can view the template file to see descriptions for all parameters.
+
. Set the following parameters as necessary:
** *KIE Server Keystore Secret Name* (`KIE_SERVER_HTTPS_SECRET`): The name of the secret for {KIE_SERVER}, as created in <<secrets-kie-create-proc>>.
** *Application Name* (`APPLICATION_NAME`): The name of the OpenShift application. It is used in the default URL for {KIE_SERVER}. OpenShift uses the application name to create a separate set of deployment configurations, services, routes, labels, and artifacts. You can deploy several applications using the same template into the same project, as long as you use different application names. Also, the application name determines the name of the server configuration (server template) on the {CENTRAL} that the {KIE_SERVER} is to join. If you are deploying several {KIE_SERVERS}, you must ensure each of the servers has a different application name.
** *KIE Server Certificate Name* (`KIE_SERVER_HTTPS_NAME`): The name of the certificate in the keystore that you created in <<secrets-kie-create-proc>>.
** *KIE Server Keystore Password* (`KIE_SERVER_HTTPS_PASSWORD`): The password for the keystore that you created in <<secrets-kie-create-proc>>.
** *KIE Server Mode* (`KIE_SERVER_MODE`): Set to `DEVELOPMENT` if you need to deploy a `SNAPSHOT` version of a KJAR artifact. 
ifdef::DM[]
In the `{PRODUCT_INIT}{ENTERPRISE_VERSION_SHORT}-kieserver.yaml` template 
endif::DM[]
ifdef::PAM[]
In the `{PRODUCT_INIT}{ENTERPRISE_VERSION_SHORT}-kieserver-*.yaml` templates
endif::PAM[]
the default value is `PRODUCTION`, which does not allow deployment of `SNAPSHOT` versions.
** *KIE Server Container Deployment* (`KIE_SERVER_CONTAINER_DEPLOYMENT`): The identifying information of the decision services (KJAR files) that the deployment must pull from the Maven repository. The format is: `<containerId>=<groupId>:<artifactId>:<version>`. You can provide two or more KJAR files using the `|` separator, as illustrated in the following example: `containerId=groupId:artifactId:version|c2=g2:a2:v2`.
** *Maven repository URL* (`MAVEN_REPO_URL`): The URL for the Maven repository.
** *Maven repository username* (`MAVEN_REPO_USERNAME`): The username for the Maven repository.
** *Maven repository password* (`MAVEN_REPO_PASSWORD`): The password for the Maven repository.
** *Disable KIE server management* (`KIE_SERVER_MGMT_DISABLED`): You must set this parameter to `true` for an immutable deployment.
** *KIE Server Startup Strategy* (`KIE_SERVER_STARTUP_STRATEGY`): You must set this parameter to `LocalContainersStartupStrategy` for an immutable deployment.
** *ImageStream Namespace* (`IMAGE_STREAM_NAMESPACE`): The namespace where the image streams are available. If the image streams were already available in your OpenShift environment (see <<imagestreams-file-install-proc>>), the namespace is `openshift`. If you have installed the image streams file, the namespace is the name of the OpenShift project.

. If you want to use {LOCAL_CENTRAL} or Smart Router, set some of the parameters that were displayed in the sample command line after you deployed the monitoring infrastructure (see <<environment-immutable-monitoring-proc>>), namely:
** Set `KIE_ADMIN_USER`, `KIE_ADMIN_PWD`, `KIE_SERVER_USER`, `KIE_SERVER_PWD`, and `KIE_SERVER_ROUTER_SERVICE` to the values that were displayed for these parameters.
** Set `KIE_SERVER_CONTROLLER_USER` to the value that was displayed for `KIE_SERVER_MONITOR_USER`.
** Set `KIE_SERVER_CONTROLLER_PWD` to the value that was displayed for `KIE_SERVER_MONITOR_PWD`.
** Set `KIE_SERVER_CONTROLLER_SERVICE` to the value that was displayed for `KIE_SERVER_MONITOR_SERVICE`.

. Complete the creation of the environment, depending on the method that you are using:
* In the OpenShift Web UI, click *Create*.
** If the `This will create resources that may have security or project behavior implications` message appears, click *Create Anyway*.
* Complete and run the command line.
