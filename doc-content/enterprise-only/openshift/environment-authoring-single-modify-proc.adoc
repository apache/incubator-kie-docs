= Modifying the template for the single authoring environment

By default, the single authoring template uses the H2 database with permanent storage. If you prefer to create a MySQL or PostgreSQL pod or to use an external database server (outside the OpenShift project), you need to modify the template before deploying the environment.

.Procedure
Edit the `{PRODUCT_INIT}{ENTERPRISE_VERSION_SHORT}-authoring.yaml` template file to make any of the following changes as necessary.

* If you want to use MySQL instead of the H2 database, you need to replace several blocks of the file, marked with comments from `BEGIN` to `END`, with blocks from the `{PRODUCT_INIT}{ENTERPRISE_VERSION_SHORT}-kieserver-mysql.yaml` file that are also marked with comments. You also need to remove several other blocks and to add blocks in designated locations:

. Replace the block named `H2 database parameters` with the block named `MySQL database parameters`. (Take this block and all subsequent replacement blocks from the `{PRODUCT_INIT}{ENTERPRISE_VERSION_SHORT}-kieserver-mysql.yaml` file.)
. Replace the block named `H2 driver settings` with the block named `MySQL driver settings`
. Replace the block named `H2 persistent volume claim` with the block named `MySQL persistent volume claim`.
. Remove the blocks named `H2 volume mount` and `H2 volume settings`
. Under the comment `Place to add database service`, add the block named `MySQL service`
. Under the comment `Place to add database deployment config`, add the block named `MySQL deployment config`

* If you want to use PostgreSQL instead of the H2 database, you need to replace several blocks of the file, marked with comments from `BEGIN` to `END`, with blocks from the `{PRODUCT_INIT}{ENTERPRISE_VERSION_SHORT}-kieserver-postgresql.yaml` file that are also marked with comments. You also need to remove several other blocks and to add blocks in designated locations:

. Replace the block named `H2 database parameters` with the block named `PostgreSQL database parameters`. (Take this block and all subsequent replacement blocks from the `{PRODUCT_INIT}{ENTERPRISE_VERSION_SHORT}-kieserver-postgresql.yaml` file.)
. Replace the block named `H2 driver settings` with the block named `PostgreSQL driver settings`
. Replace the block named `H2 persistent volume claim` with the block named `PostgreSQL persistent volume claim`.
. Remove the blocks named `H2 volume mount` and `H2 volume settings`
. Under the comment `Place to add database service`, add the block named `PostgreSQL service`
. Under the comment `Place to add database deployment config`, add the block named `PostgreSQL deployment config`

* If you want to use an external database server, replace several blocks of the file, marked with comments from `BEGIN` to `END`, with blocks from the `{PRODUCT_INIT}{ENTERPRISE_VERSION_SHORT}-kieserver-externaldb.yaml` file, and also remove some blocks:
. Replace the block named `H2 database parameters` with the block named `External database parameters`. (Take this block and all subsequent replacement blocks from the `{PRODUCT_INIT}{ENTERPRISE_VERSION_SHORT}-kieserver-externaldb.yaml` file.)
. Replace the block named `H2 driver settings` with the block named `External database driver settings`.
. Remove the following blocks of the file, marked with comments from `BEGIN` to `END`:
** `H2 persistent volume claim`
** `H2 volume mount`
** `H2 volume settings`

IMPORTANT: The standard {KIE_SERVER} image includes drivers for MySQL and PostgreSQL external database servers. If you want to use another database server, you must build a custom {KIE_SERVER} image. For instructions, see <<externaldb-build-proc>>.
