= Preparing Git hooks

In an authoring environment you can use Git hooks to execute custom operations when the source code of a project in {CENTRAL} is changed. The typical use of Git hooks is for interaction with an upstream repository.

To enable Git hooks to interact with an upstream repository using SSH authentication, you must also provide a secret key and a known hosts file for authentication with the repository.

Skip this procedure if you do not want to configure Git hooks.

.Procedure

. Create the Git hooks files. For instructions, see the https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks[Git hooks reference documentation].
+
[NOTE]
====
A `pre-commit` script is not supported in {CENTRAL}. Use a `post-commit` script.
====
+
. Create a configuration map (ConfigMap) or persistent volume with the files.
** If the Git hooks consist of one or several fixed script files, use the `oc` command to create a configuration map. For example:
+
[subs="attributes,verbatim,macros"]
----
oc create configmap git-hooks --from-file=post-commit=post-commit
----
+
** If the Git hooks consist of long files or depend on binaries, such as executable or JAR files, use a persistent volume. You must create a persistent volume, create a persistent volume claim and associate the volume with the claim, and transfer files to the volume.
+
For instructions about persistent volumes and persistent volume claims, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.6/html/storage/index[Storage] in the {OPENSHIFT} documentation. For instructions about copying files onto a persistent volume, see https://blog.openshift.com/transferring-files-in-and-out-of-containers-in-openshift-part-3/[Transferring files in and out of containers].
+
. If the Git hooks scripts must interact with an upstream repository using SSH authentication, prepare a secret with the necessary files:
.. Prepare the `id_rsa` file with a private key that matches a public key stored in the repository.
.. Prepare the `known_hosts` file with the correct name, address, and public key for the repository.
.. Create a secret with the two files using the `oc` command, for example:
+
[subs="attributes,verbatim,macros"]
----
oc create secret git-hooks-secret --from-file=id_rsa=id_rsa --from-file=known_hosts=known_hosts
----
+
[NOTE]
====
When the deployment uses this secret, it mounts the `id_rsa` and `known_hosts` files into the `/home/jboss/.ssh` directory on {CENTRAL} pods.
