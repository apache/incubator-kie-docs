= Setting Process Instance Migration configuration for the environment

You can use the operator to deploy the Process Instance Migration (PIM) service. You can use the PIM service to define the migration between two different process definitions, known as a migration plan. You can apply the migration plan to the running process instances in a specific {KIE_SERVER}.

The PIM service uses a database server for its operation.

.Prerequisites

* You completed basic configuration of a {PRODUCT} environment using {operator_name} in the installer wizard according to the instructions in <<operator-deploy-basic-proc_{context}>>.

.Procedure
. If the *Installation*, *Security*, *Console*, *KIE Servers*, or *Smart Router* tab is open, click *Next* until you view the *Process Instance Migration* tab.
. Click *Set Process Instance Migration* to add PIM to the environment and to configure PIM.
. In the *Database type* field, select the database that the PIM service must use. The following values are available:
** `mysql`: A MySQL server, created in a separate pod.
** `postgresql`: A PostgreSQL server, created in a separate pod. Use this setting unless you have a specific reason to use any other setting.
** `h2`: A built-in `h2` database engine that does not require a separate pod.
. Optional: Set configuration parameters of the persistent volume for the database:
** In the *Size* field, enter the size of the persistence volume
** In the *StorageClass name* field, enter the storage class name for the persistent volume

.Next steps

Click *Finish* and then click *Deploy* to deploy the environment.
