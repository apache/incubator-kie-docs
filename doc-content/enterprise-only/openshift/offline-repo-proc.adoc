= Preparing a Maven repository for offline use 

If your {OPENSHIFT} environment does not have outgoing access to the public Internet, you must prepare a Maven repository with a mirror of all the necessary artifacts and make this repository available to your environment for use in source to image (S2I) builds.

Skip this procedure if your {OPENSHIFT} environment is connected to the Internet.

.Procedure

. Build the source of your services on any machine using the `mvn clean install` command.

. Copy the downloaded Maven artifacts from the machine onto an internal Maven repository (for example, Nexus). 

. Make this repository available in your {OPENSHIFT} environment.
