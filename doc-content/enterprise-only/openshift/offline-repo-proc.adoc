= Preparing a Maven mirror repository for offline use

If your
ifdef::offline_onprem[]
{PRODUCT} deployment
endif::offline_onprem[]
ifndef::offline_onprem[]
{OPENSHIFT} environment
endif::offline_onprem[]
does not have outgoing access to the public Internet, you must prepare a Maven repository with a mirror of all the necessary artifacts and make this repository available to your environment.

[NOTE]
====
You do not need to complete this procedure if your
ifdef::offline_onprem[]
{PRODUCT} deployment
endif::offline_onprem[]
ifndef::offline_onprem[]
{OPENSHIFT} environment
endif::offline_onprem[]
is connected to the Internet.
====

.Prerequisites

* A computer that has outgoing access to the public Internet is available.

.Procedure

ifndef::offline_onprem[]
ifeval::["{context}"=="openshift-immutable"]
. Prepare a Maven release repository to which you can write. The repository must allow read access without authentication. Your OpenShift environment must have access to this repository. You can deploy a Nexus repository manager in the OpenShift environment. For instructions about setting up Nexus on OpenShift, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/3.11/html/developer_guide/tutorials#nexus-setting-up-nexus[Setting up Nexus]. Use this repository as a mirror repository.
ifdef::PAM[]
If you are planning to create immutable servers from KJAR services or to deploy {CENTRAL} Monitoring,

ifdef::DM[]
If you are planning to create immutable servers from KJAR services,
endif::DM[]
place your services in this repository as well. You must configure this repository as the external Maven repository. You cannot configure a separate mirror repository in an immutable environment.

Alternatively, if you use a custom external repository (for example, Nexus) for your services, you can use the same repository as a mirror repository.

. On the computer that has an outgoing connection to the public Internet, complete the following steps:
.. Download the latest version of the http://release-engineering.github.io/offliner/[Offliner tool].
.. Download the `{PRODUCT_FILE}-offliner.txt` product deliverable file from the {PRODUCT_DOWNLOAD_LINK}[Software Downloads] page of the Red Hat Customer Portal.
.. Enter the following command to use the Offliner tool to download the required artifacts:
+
[subs="attributes,verbatim,macros"]
----
java -jar offliner-<version>.jar -r \https://maven.repository.redhat.com/ga/ -r \https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/ -d /home/user/temp {PRODUCT_FILE}-offliner.txt
----
+
Replace `/home/user/temp` with an empty temporary directory and `<version>` with the version of the Offliner tool that you downloaded. The download can take a significant amount of time.
.. If the tool reports failed downloads, enter the following commands to download the artifacts that failed to download the first time:
+
[subs="attributes,verbatim,macros"]
----
grep Path: errors.log | sed -n -e 's/^.*Path: //p' > failed-downloads.txt
java -jar offliner-<version>.jar -r \https://maven.repository.redhat.com/ga/ -r \https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/ -d /home/user/temp failed-downloads.txt
----
+
If failures are reported again and are a minority of the total number downloaded the first time, you can proceed.
ifndef::offline_onprem[]
.. Upload all artifacts from the temporary directory to the Maven mirror repository that you prepared. You can use the https://github.com/simpligility/maven-repository-tools/tree/master/maven-repository-provisioner[Maven Repository Provisioner] utility to upload the artifacts.
endif::offline_onprem[]
. If you developed services outside {CENTRAL} and they have additional dependencies, add the dependencies to the mirror repository. If you developed the services as Maven projects, you can use the following steps to prepare these dependencies automatically. Complete the steps on the computer that has an outgoing connection to the public Internet.
.. Create a backup of the local Maven cache directory (`~/.m2/repository`) and then clear the directory.
.. Build the source of your projects using the `mvn clean install` command.
.. For every project, enter the following command to ensure that Maven downloads all runtime dependencies for all the artifacts generated by the project:
+
[subs="attributes,verbatim,macros"]
----
mvn -e -DskipTests dependency:go-offline -f /path/to/project/pom.xml --batch-mode -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true
----
+
Replace `/path/to/project/pom.xml` with the correct path to the `pom.xml` file of the project.
+
ifndef::offline_onprem[]
.. Upload all artifacts from the local Maven cache directory (`~/.m2/repository`) to the Maven mirror repository that you prepared. You can use the https://github.com/simpligility/maven-repository-tools/tree/master/maven-repository-provisioner[Maven Repository Provisioner] utility to upload the artifacts.
endif::offline_onprem[]
ifdef::offline_onprem[]
.. Copy the contents of the local Maven cache directory (`~/.m2/repository`) to the temporary directory that you are using.
. Copy the contents of the temporary directory to a directory on the computer on which you deployed {PRODUCT}. This directory becomes the offline Maven mirror repository.
. Create and configure a `settings.xml` file for your {PRODUCT} deployment, according to instructions in
ifeval::["{context}"=="install-on-eap"]
<<maven-external-configure-proc_install-on-eap>>.
endif::[]
ifeval::["{context}"=="install-on-jws"]
<<maven-settings-configuration-ref>>.
endif::[]
ifeval::["{context}"=="install-on-tomcat"]
<<maven-settings-configuration-ref>>.
endif::[]
. Make the following changes in the `settings.xml` file:
** Under the `<profile>` tag, if a `<repositories>` or `<pluginRepositores>` tag is absent, add the tags as necessary.
** Under `<repositories>` add the following sequence:
+
[source,xml]
----
<repository>
  <id>offline-repository</id>
  <url>file:///path/to/repo</url>
  <releases>
    <enabled>true</enabled>
  </releases>
  <snapshots>
    <enabled>false</enabled>
  </snapshots>
</repository>
----
+
Replace `/path/to/repo` with the full path to the local Maven mirror repository directory.
** Under `<pluginRepositories>` add the following sequence:
+
[source,xml]
----
<repository>
  <id>offline-plugin-repository</id>
  <url>file:///path/to/repo</url>
  <releases>
    <enabled>true</enabled>
  </releases>
  <snapshots>
    <enabled>false</enabled>
  </snapshots>
</repository>
----
+
Replace `/path/to/repo` with the full path to the local Maven mirror repository directory.
ifeval::["{context}"=="install-on-eap"]
+
. Set the `kie.maven.offline.force` property for {CENTRAL} to `true`. For instructions about setting properties for {CENTRAL}, see <<business-central-system-properties-ref>>.
