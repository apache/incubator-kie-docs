= Preparing a Maven mirror repository for offline use 

If your {OPENSHIFT} environment does not have outgoing access to the public Internet, you must prepare a Maven repository with a mirror of all the necessary artifacts and make this repository available to your environment.

Skip this procedure if your {OPENSHIFT} environment is connected to the Internet.

.Procedure

. Prepare a Maven release repository to which you can write. The repository must allow read access without authentication. Your OpenShift environment must have access to this repository. You can deploy a Nexus repository manager in the OpenShift environment. For instructions about setting up Nexus on OpenShift, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/3.11/html/developer_guide/tutorials#nexus-setting-up-nexus[Setting up Nexus]. 

. Complete the following actions on a computer that has an outgoing connection to the public Internet:

.. Clear the local Maven cache directory (`~/.m2/repository`).
.. Build the source of your services using the `mvn clean install` command.
.. Upload all artifacts from the local Maven cache directory (`~/.m2/repository`) to the Maven repository that you prepared. You can use the https://github.com/simpligility/maven-repository-tools/tree/master/maven-repository-provisioner[Maven Repository Provisioner] utility to upload the artifacts.
