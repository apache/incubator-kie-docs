//Misha, should this be Dashbuilder Runtime or is there something separate for OS called Dashbuilder Standalone?

Dashbuilder Standalone is an independent implementation of Dashbuilder, which is the dashboard and reporting tool that is integrated with {CENTRAL}.

You can install Dashbuilder Standalone separately from {PRODUCT} and import or create your own dashboards.
