= Authoring environment
You can deploy an environment for creating and modifying processes using {CENTRAL}. It consists of {CENTRAL} for the authoring work and {KIE_SERVER} for test execution of the processes.

Depending on your needs, you can deploy either a single authoring environment or a high-availability (HA) authoring environment.

A single authoring environment contains two pods. One of the pods runs {CENTRAL}, the other runs {KIE_SERVER}. The {KIE_SERVER} includes an embedded in-memory H2 database engine. This type of environment uses the least possible amount of resources. However, because of the in-memory database, restarting the {KIE_SERVER} pod leads to loss of all process information.

An HA authoring environment contains several pods. Both {CENTRAL} and {KIE_SERVER} are provided in scalable pods that can run in parallel and share persistent storage. The database is provided by a separate pod. Use a high-availability authoring environment to provide maximum reliability and responsiveness, especially if several users are involved in authoring at the same time.

You can also deploy additional managed or immutable {KIE_SERVERS}, if required. {CENTRAL} can automatically discover any {KIE_SERVERS} in the same namespace, including immutable {KIE_SERVERS} and managed {KIE_SERVERS}. This feature requires the `OpenShiftStartupStrategy` setting, which is enabled for all {KIE_SERVERS} except those deployed in a fixed managed infrastructure. For instructions about deploying managed {KIE_SERVERS} with the `OpenShiftStartupStrategy` setting enabled, see {URL_DEPLOYING_MANAGED_FREEFORM_ON_OPENSHIFT}[_{DEPLOYING_MANAGED_FREEFORM_ON_OPENSHIFT}_]. For instructions about deploying immutable {KIE_SERVERS}, see {URL_DEPLOYING_IMMUTABLE_ON_OPENSHIFT}[_{DEPLOYING_IMMUTABLE_ON_OPENSHIFT}_].

In {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}, high-availability {CENTRAL} functionality is for Technology Preview only. For more information on Red Hat Technology Preview features, see https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/[Technology Preview Features Scope].
