[id='environment-trial-con_{context}']
= Trial environment

You can deploy a trial (evaluation) {PRODUCT} environment. It consists of {CENTRAL} for authoring or managing services and {KIE_SERVER} for test execution of services.

This environment does not include permanent storage. Assets that you create or modify in a trial environment are not saved.

This environment is intended for test and demonstration access. It supports cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). This means that {KIE_SERVER} endpoints can be accessed using a browser when other resources on the page are provided by other servers. {KIE_SERVER} endpoints are normally intended for REST calls, but browser access can be needed in some demonstration configurations.
