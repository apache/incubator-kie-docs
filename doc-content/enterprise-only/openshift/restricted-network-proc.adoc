= Preparing for deployment in a restricted network
You can deploy {PRODUCT} in a restricted network that is not connected to the public Internet. For instructions about operator deployment in a restricted network, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/{OPENSHIFT_VERSION}/html/operators/administrator-tasks#olm-restricted-networks[Using Operator Lifecycle Manager on restricted networks] in {OPENSHIFT} documentation.

[IMPORTANT]
====
In {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}, deployment on restricted networks is for Technology Preview only. For more information on Red Hat Technology Preview features, see https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/[Technology Preview Features Scope].

In order to use a deployment that does not have outgoing access to the public Internet, you must also prepare a Maven repository with a mirror of all the necessary artifacts. For instructions about creating this repository, see <<offline-repo-proc_{context}>>.
