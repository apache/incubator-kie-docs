:LOCAL_CENTRAL: {CENTRAL} Monitoring

As a part of a managed server infrastructure, you can deploy an additional {KIE_SERVER} on the OpenShift infrastructure. You can then use {CENTRAL} to deploy, undeploy, and manage services on this {KIE_SERVER}.

To deploy an additional {KIE_SERVER}, use the `{PRODUCT_INIT}{ENTERPRISE_VERSION_SHORT}-kieserver.yaml` template file. You can download the file from the {PRODUCT_DOWNLOAD_LINK}[Software Downloads] page of the Red Hat Customer Portal.


.Procedure

. Use one of the following methods to deploy the template:
* In the OpenShift Web UI, select *Add to Project -> Import YAML / JSON* and then select or paste the `{PRODUCT_INIT}{ENTERPRISE_VERSION_SHORT}-kieserver.yaml` file. In the *Add Template* window, ensure *Process the template* is selected and click *Continue*.
* To use the OpenShift command line console, prepare the following command line:
+
[subs="attributes,verbatim,macros"]
----
oc new-app -f <template-path>/{PRODUCT_INIT}{ENTERPRISE_VERSION_SHORT}-kieserver.yaml -p KIE_SERVER_HTTPS_SECRET=kieserver-app-secret
----
+
In this command line:
+
** Replace `<template-path>` with the path to the downloaded template file.
** Use as many `-p PARAMETER=value` pairs as needed to set the required parameters. You can view the template file to see descriptions for all parameters.
+
. Set the following parameters:
+
** *KIE server controller service* (`KIE_SERVER_CONTROLLER_SERVICE`): The OpenShift service name for the {CENTRAL} that you installed for this environment.
** *KIE server controller user* (`KIE_SERVER_CONTROLLER_USER`): The controller user name for logging onto the {CENTRAL} that you configured.
** *KIE server controller password* (`KIE_SERVER_CONTROLLER_PWD`): The controller password for logging onto the {CENTRAL} that you configured.
** *KIE Server Keystore Secret Name* (`KIE_SERVER_HTTPS_SECRET`): The name of the secret for {KIE_SERVER}, as created in <<secrets-kie-create-proc>>.
** *Application Name* (`APPLICATION_NAME`): The name of the OpenShift application. It is used in the default URL for {KIE_SERVER}. OpenShift uses the application name to create a separate set of deployment configurations, services, routes, labels, and artifacts. You can deploy several applications using the same template into the same project, as long as you use different application names. Also, the application name determines the name of the server configuration (server template) on the {CENTRAL} that the {KIE_SERVER} is to join.
** *KIE Server Certificate Name* (`KIE_SERVER_HTTPS_NAME`): The name of the certificate in the keystore that you created in <<secrets-kie-create-proc>>.
** *KIE Server Keystore Password* (`KIE_SERVER_HTTPS_PASSWORD`): The password for the keystore that you created in <<secrets-kie-create-proc>>.
** *KIE Server Mode* (`KIE_SERVER_MODE`): In the `{PRODUCT_INIT}{ENTERPRISE_VERSION_SHORT}-kieserver.yaml` template the default value is `PRODUCTION`; in this mode, you can not deploy `SNAPSHOT` versions of KJAR artifacts and can not change versions of an artifact in an existing container. (To deploy a new version with `PRODUCTION` mode, you can create a new container on the same {KIE_SERVER}). To deploy `SNAPSHOT` versions or to change versions of an artifact in an existing container, set this parameter to `DEVELOPMENT`. 
** *ImageStream Namespace* (`IMAGE_STREAM_NAMESPACE`): The namespace where the image streams are available. If the image streams were already available in your OpenShift environment (see <<imagestreams-file-install-proc>>), the namespace is `openshift`. If you have installed the image streams file, the namespace is the name of the OpenShift project.
. Set the parameters for access to the Maven repository, depending on whether you configured the {CENTRAL} to use the built-in or external repository:
.. For a built-in repository:
*** *Name of the Maven service hosted by {CENTRAL}* (`{CENTRAL_CAPITAL_UNDER}_MAVEN_SERVICE`): The service name for the built-in Maven repository of the {CENTRAL}.
*** *Username for the Maven service hosted by {CENTRAL}* (`{CENTRAL_CAPITAL_UNDER}_MAVEN_USERNAME`): The user name for the built-in Maven repository of the {CENTRAL}. Enter the user name that you configured for the {CENTRAL} as `{CENTRAL_CAPITAL_UNDER}_MAVEN_USERNAME`.
*** *Password to access the Maven service hosted by {CENTRAL}* (`{CENTRAL_CAPITAL_UNDER}_MAVEN_PASSWORD`): The password for the built-in Maven repository of the {CENTRAL}. Enter the password that you configured for the {CENTRAL} as `{CENTRAL_CAPITAL_UNDER}_MAVEN_PASSWORD`.
+
.. For an external repository:
** *Maven repository URL* (`MAVEN_REPO_URL`): The URL for the Maven repository with services.
** *Maven repository username* (`MAVEN_REPO_USERNAME`): The user name for the Maven repository.
** *Maven repository password* (`MAVEN_REPO_PASSWORD`): The password for the Maven repository.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can set up access to both the built-in Maven repository of the {CENTRAL} an external Maven repository if your services have dependencies in both repositories.

. Complete the creation of the environment, depending on the method that you are using:
* In the OpenShift Web UI, click *Create*.
** A `This will create resources that may have security or project behavior implications` pop-up message might be displayed. If it is displayed, click *Create Anyway*.
* Complete and run the command line.
