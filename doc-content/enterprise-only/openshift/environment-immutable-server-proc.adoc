= Deploying an immutable {KIE_SERVER} from service source code

To deploy an immutable {KIE_SERVER} from service source code, use the `{PRODUCT_INIT}{ENTERPRISE_VERSION_SHORT}-prod-immutable-kieserver.yaml` template file. You can extract this file from the `{PRODUCT_FILE}-openshift-templates.zip` product deliverable file. You can download the file from the {PRODUCT_DOWNLOAD_LINK}[Software Downloads] page of the Red Hat Customer Portal.

ifdef::PAM[]
If you want to modify the environment defined by the template file, see <<environment-immutable-modify-proc>>.

endif::PAM[]
When you deploy an immutable {KIE_SERVER}, the deployment procedure retrieves the source code for any services that must run on this server, builds the services, and includes them in the server image.

ifdef::PAM[]
You can configure the {KIE_SERVER} to connect to Smart Router and to {LOCAL_CENTRAL}. If you use the server with {LOCAL_CENTRAL}, you must ensure that the same versions of KJAR files are uploaded to the Maven repository that the {LOCAL_CENTRAL} instance uses.

endif::PAM[]
.Procedure

. Use one of the following methods to deploy the template:
* In the OpenShift Web UI, select *Add to Project -> Import YAML / JSON* and then select or paste the `{PRODUCT_INIT}{ENTERPRISE_VERSION_SHORT}-prod-immutable-kieserver.yaml` file.
In the *Add Template* window, ensure *Process the template* is selected and click *Continue*.
* To use the OpenShift command line console, prepare the following command line:
+
[subs="attributes,verbatim,macros"]
----
oc new-app -f <template-path>/{PRODUCT_INIT}{ENTERPRISE_VERSION_SHORT}-prod-immutable-kieserver.yaml -p KIE_SERVER_HTTPS_SECRET=kieserver-app-secret
----
+
In this command line:
+
** Replace `<template-path>` with the path to the downloaded template file.
** Use as many `-p PARAMETER=value` pairs as needed to set the required parameters. You can view the template file to see descriptions for all parameters.
ifdef::PAM[]
+
Alternatively, if you have deployed the monitoring infrastructure (see <<environment-immutable-monitoring-proc>>), use the command line that was displayed when you deployed the infrastructure and add the `-p KIE_SERVER_HTTPS_SECRET=kieserver-app-secret` parameter.
endif::PAM[]
+
. Set the following parameters as necessary:
** *KIE Server Keystore Secret Name* (`KIE_SERVER_HTTPS_SECRET`): The name of the secret for {KIE_SERVER}, as created in <<secrets-kie-create-proc>>.
** *Application Name* (`APPLICATION_NAME`): The name of the OpenShift application. It is used in the default URL for {KIE_SERVER}. OpenShift uses the application name to create a separate set of deployment configurations, services, routes, labels, and artifacts. You can deploy several applications using the same template into the same project, as long as you use different application names. Also, the application name determines the name of the server configuration (server template) on the {CENTRAL} that the {KIE_SERVER} is to join. If you are deploying several {KIE_SERVERS}, you must ensure each of the servers has a different application name.
** *KIE Server Certificate Name* (`KIE_SERVER_HTTPS_NAME`): The name of the certificate in the keystore that you created in <<secrets-kie-create-proc>>.
** *KIE Server Keystore Password* (`KIE_SERVER_HTTPS_PASSWORD`): The password for the keystore that you created in <<secrets-kie-create-proc>>.
** *KIE Server Container Deployment* (`KIE_SERVER_CONTAINER_DEPLOYMENT`): The identifying information of the decision service (KJAR file) that is built from your source. The format is: `<containerId>=<groupId>:<artifactId>:<version>`. You can provide two or more KJAR files using the `|` separator, as illustrated in the following example: `containerId=groupId:artifactId:version|c2=g2:a2:v2`. The Maven build process must produce all these files from the source in the Git repository.
** *Git Repository URL* (`SOURCE_REPOSITORY_URL`): The URL for the Git repository that contains the source for your decision service.
** *Git Reference* (`SOURCE_REPOSITORY_REF`): The branch in the Git repository
** *Context Directory* (`CONTEXT_DIR`): The path to the source within the project downloaded from the Git repository
** *Artifact Directory* (`ARTIFACT_DIR`): The path within the project that contains the required binary files (KJAR files and any other necessary files) after a successful Maven build. Normally this directory is the target directory of the build. However, you can provide prebuilt binaries in this directory in the Git repository
** *ImageStream Namespace* (`IMAGE_STREAM_NAMESPACE`): The namespace where the image streams are available. If the image streams were already available in your OpenShift environment (see <<imagestreams-file-install-proc>>), the namespace is `openshift`. If you have installed the image streams file, the namespace is the name of the OpenShift project.
+
. If your build includes dependencies that are not available on the public Maven tree and require a separate repository, set the parameters to provide this repository:
** *Maven repository URL* (`MAVEN_REPO_URL`): The URL for the Maven repository.
** *Maven repository username* (`MAVEN_REPO_USERNAME`): The username for the Maven repository.
** *Maven repository password* (`MAVEN_REPO_PASSWORD`): The password for the Maven repository.

. If you want to use {LOCAL_CENTRAL} or Smart Router, set the parameters that were displayed in the sample command line after you deployed the monitoring infrastructure (see <<environment-immutable-monitoring-proc>>).

. Complete the creation of the environment, depending on the method that you are using:
* In the OpenShift Web UI, click *Create*.
** If the `This will create resources that may have security or project behavior implications` message appears, click *Create Anyway*.
* Complete and run the command line.
