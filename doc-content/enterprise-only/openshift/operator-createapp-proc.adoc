= Deploying a {PRODUCT} environment using the operator

After subscribing to the operator, you can _create an application_ to deploy an environment.

.Procedure

. Enter your project in the OpenShift Web cluster console.
. In the OpenShift Web console navigation panel, select *Operators* and then *Subscriptions*.
. Click the name of the subscription that contains `businessautomation`. Information about this subscription is displayed.
. Under the *Installed version* heading, click the version name of the subscription. An overview of the subscription is displayed.
. Click *Create KieApp*. A YAML source is displayed.
. Set the *name* field to an application name that is unique in the project.
. Set the *environment* field to the required environment type. Each of the types is a default deployment pattern. You can modify the pattern by editing this YAML source; you can also modify the deployment after it is completed. The following types are available:

ifdef::PAM[]
** `rhpam-trial`: A trial environment that you can set up quickly and use to evaluate or demonstrate developing and running assets. Includes {CENTRAL} and a {KIE_SERVER}. This environment does not use any persistent storage, and any work you do in the environment is not saved.
** `rhpam-production`: An environment for running existing services for staging and production purposes. This environment includes {CENTRAL} Monitoring, Smart Router, and two groups of {KIE_SERVER} pods. You can deploy and undeploy services on every such group and also scale the group up or down as necessary. Use {CENTRAL} Monitoring to deploy, run, and stop the services and to monitor their execution.
** `rhpam-production-immutable`: An alternate environment for running existing services for staging and production purposes. This environment includes {CENTRAL} Monitoring. You can configure one or more {KIE_SERVER} replicated pods that build a service from source. In this environment, when you deploy a {KIE_SERVER} pod, it builds an image that loads and starts a service or group of services. You cannot stop any service on the pod or add any new service to the pod. If you want to use another version of a service or modify the configuration in any other way, you deploy a new server image and displace the old one. In this system, the {KIE_SERVER} runs like any other pod on the OpenShift environment. You can use any container-based integration workflows and do not need to use any other tools to manage the pods.
** `rhpam-authoring`: An environment for creating and modifying services using {CENTRAL}. It consists of pods that provide {CENTRAL} for the authoring work and a {KIE_SERVER} for test execution of the services.
** `rhpam-authoring-ha`: An environment for creating and modifying services using {CENTRAL}. It consists of pods that provide {CENTRAL} for the authoring work and a {KIE_SERVER} for test execution of the services. This version of the authoring environment supports scaling the {CENTRAL} pod to ensure high availability.
endif::PAM[]
ifdef::DM[]
** `rhdm-trial`: A trial environment that you can set up quickly and use to evaluate or demonstrate developing and running assets. Includes {CENTRAL} and a {KIE_SERVER}. This environment does not use any persistent storage, and any work you do in the environment is not saved.
** `rhdm-authoring`: An environment for creating and modifying services using {CENTRAL}. It consists of pods that provide {CENTRAL} for the authoring work and a {KIE_SERVER} for test execution of the services. You can also use this environment to run services for staging and production purposes. You can add {KIE_SERVERS} to the environment and they are managed by the same {CENTRAL}.
** `rhdm-authoring-ha`: An environment for creating and modifying services using {CENTRAL}. It consists of pods that provide {CENTRAL} for the authoring work and a {KIE_SERVER} for test execution of the services. This version of the authoring environment supports scaling the {CENTRAL} pod to ensure high availability.
** `rhdm-production-immutable`: An alternate environment for running existing services for staging and production purposes. You can configure one or more {KIE_SERVER} replicated pods that build a service from source. In this environment, when you deploy a {KIE_SERVER} pod, it builds an image that loads and starts a service or group of services. You cannot stop any service on the pod or add any new service to the pod. If you want to use another version of a service or modify the configuration in any other way, you deploy a new server image and displace the old one. In this system, the {KIE_SERVER} runs like any other pod on the OpenShift environment. You can use any container-based integration workflows and do not need to use any other tools to manage the pods.

. Add lines to the YAML source to modify the environment, using the snippets listed in this document as a reference:
** The following snippet adds an immutable {KIE_SERVER} pod that builds a service from source. You must add at least one copy of this snippet when creating an immutable environment.

Replace the following values:

*** `<deployment>`: The identifying information of the decision service (KJAR file) that is built from your source. The format is `<containerId>=<groupId>:<artifactId>:<version>`. You can provide two or more KJAR files using the `|` separator, for example `containerId=groupId:artifactId:version|c2=g2:a2:v2`. The Maven build process must produce all these files from the source in the Git repository.
*** `<url>`: The URL for the Git repository that contains the source for your decision service.
*** `<branch>`: The branch in the Git repository.
*** `<directory>`: The path to the source within the project downloaded from the Git repository.

If the LDAP server does not define all the roles required for your deployment, you can map LDAP groups to {PRODUCT} roles. To enable LDAP role mapping, set the `rolesProperties` value to the fully qualified path name of a file that defines role mapping, for example, `/opt/eap/standalone/configuration/rolemapping/rolemapping.properties`. You must provide this file and mount it at this path in all applicable deployment configurations. For instructions about providing this file, see <<rolemapping-proc_{context}>>.
+
If the `replaceRole` parameter is set to `true`, mapped roles replace the roles defined on the LDAP server. It the parameter is set to `false`, both mapped roles and roles defined on the LDAP server are set as user application roles. The default setting is `false`.
. After completing the modification of the YAML source, click *Create* to create the application.
