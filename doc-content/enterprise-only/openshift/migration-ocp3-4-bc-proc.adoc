= Migrating information in {CENTRAL}

If you have an existing authoring environment in {OPENSHIFT} version 3, you can copy the `.niogit` repository and the Maven repository from {CENTRAL} in this environment to {CENTRAL} in a new deployment on {OPENSHIFT} version 4. This action makes all the same projects and artifacts available in the new deployment.

.Prerequisites

* You must have a machine that has network access to both the {OPENSHIFT} version 3 and {OPENSHIFT} version 4 infrastructures.
* The `oc` command-line client from {OPENSHIFT} version 4 must be installed on the machine. For instructions about installing the command-line client, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.6/html/cli_tools/openshift-cli-oc#installing-the-cli[_CLI tools_] in {OPENSHIFT} documentation.

.Procedure

. Ensure that no web clients and no client applications are connected to any elements of the old and new deployment, including {CENTRAL} and {KIE_SERVERS}.
. Create an empty temporary directory and change into it.
. Using the `oc` command, log in to the {OPENSHIFT} version 3 infrastructure and switch to the project containing the old deployment.
. To view the pod names in the old deployment, run the following command:
+
----
oc get pods
----
+
Find the {CENTRAL} pod. The name of this pod includes `{PRODUCT_INIT}centr`. In a high-availability deployment, you can use any of the {CENTRAL} pods.
+
. Use the `oc` command to copy the the `.niogit` repository and the Maven repository from the pod to the local machine, for example:
+
[subs="attributes,verbatim,macros,specialchars,replacements"]
----
oc cp myapp-{PRODUCT_INIT}centr-5-689mw:/opt/kie/data/.niogit .niogit
oc cp myapp-{PRODUCT_INIT}centr-5-689mw:/opt/kie/data/maven-repository maven-repository
----
+
. Using the `oc` command, log in to the {OPENSHIFT} version 4 infrastructure and switch to the project containing the new deployment.
. To view the pod names in the new deployment, run the following command:
+
----
oc get pods
----
+
Find the {CENTRAL} pod. The name of this pod includes `{PRODUCT_INIT}centr`. In a high-availability deployment, you can use any of the {CENTRAL} pods.
+
. Use the `oc` command to copy the the `.niogit` repository and the Maven repository from the local machine to the pod, for example:
+
[subs="attributes,verbatim,macros,specialchars,replacements"]
----
oc cp .niogit myappnew-{PRODUCT_INIT}centr-abd24:/opt/kie/data/.niogit
oc cp maven-repository myappnew-{PRODUCT_INIT}centr-abd24:/opt/kie/data/maven-repository
