* `rhpam71-authoring-ha.yaml` provides a high-availability {CENTRAL}, a {KIE_SERVER} connected to the {CENTRAL}, and a MySQL instance that the {KIE_SERVER} uses. You can use this environment to author processes, services, and other business assets. The high-availability functionality is in technical preview. For details about this template, see <<rhpam71-authoring-ha-ref>>.

ifeval::["{context}"=="openshift-managed"]
* `rhpam71-prod.yaml` provides a high-availability {CENTRAL} Monitoring instance, a Smart Router, two distinct {KIE_SERVERS} connected to the {CENTRAL} and to the Smart Router, and two PostgreSQL instances. Each {KIE_SERVER} uses its own PostgreSQL instance. You can use this environment to execute business assets in a production or staging environment. For details about this template, see <<rhpam71-prod-ref>>.

* `rhpam71-sit.yaml` provides a {CENTRAL} Monitoring instance, a Smart Router, two distinct {KIE_SERVERS} connected to the {CENTRAL} and to the Smart Router, and two PostgreSQL instances. Each {KIE_SERVER} uses its own PostgreSQL instance. You can use this environment to execute business assets in a production or staging environment. For details about this template, see <<rhpam71-sit-ref>>.

ifeval::["{context}"=="openshift-immutable"]
* `rhpam71-prod-immutable-monitor.yaml` provides a {CENTRAL} Monitoring instance and a Smart Router that you can use with immutable {KIE_SERVERS}. When you deploy this template, OpenShift displays the settings that you must then use for deploying the `rhpam71-prod-immutable-kieserver.yaml` template. For details about this template, see <<rhpam71-prod-immutable-monitor-ref>>.

* `rhpam71-prod-immutable-kieserver.yaml` provides an immutable {KIE_SERVER}. When you deploy this template, a source-to-image (S2I) build is triggered for one or several services that are to run on the {KIE_SERVER}. The {KIE_SERVER} can optionally be configured to connect to the {CENTRAL} Monitoring and Smart Router provided by `rhpam71-prod-immutable-monitor.yaml`. For details about this template, see <<rhpam71-prod-immutable-kieserver-ref>>.

* `rhpam71-kieserver-externaldb.yaml` provides a {KIE_SERVER} that uses an external database. You can configure the {KIE_SERVER} to connect to a {CENTRAL}. Also, you can copy sections from this template into another template to configure a {KIE_SERVER} in the other template to use an external database. For details about this template, see <<rhpam71-kieserver-externaldb-ref>>.

* `rhpam71-kieserver-mysql.yaml` provides a {KIE_SERVER} and a MySQL instance that the {KIE_SERVER} uses. You can configure the {KIE_SERVER} to connect to a {CENTRAL}.

For details about this template, see <<rhpam71-kieserver-mysql-ref>>.

* `rhpam71-kieserver-postgresql.yaml` provides a {KIE_SERVER} and a PostgreSQL instance that the {KIE_SERVER} uses. You can configure the {KIE_SERVER} to connect to a {CENTRAL}. Also, you can copy sections from this template into another template to configure a {KIE_SERVER} in the other template to use PostgreSQL and to provide the PostgreSQL instance. For details about this template, see <<rhpam71-kieserver-mysql-ref>>.
