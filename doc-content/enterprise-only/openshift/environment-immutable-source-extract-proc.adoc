+
[subs="attributes,verbatim,macros"]
----
git clone ssh://<adminUser>@<{URL_COMPONENT_CENTRAL}-host>:8001/<MySpace>/<MyProject>
----
+
In this command, replace the following variables:
+
** `<adminUser>` with the administrative user for {CENTRAL}
** `<{URL_COMPONENT_CENTRAL}-host>` with the host on which {CENTRAL} is running
** `<MySpace>` with the name of the {CENTRAL} space in which the project is located
** `<MyProject>` with the name of the project
+
. Upload the source code to another Git repository for the S2I build.
