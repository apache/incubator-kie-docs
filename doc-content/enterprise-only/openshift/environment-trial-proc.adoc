= Deploying a trial environment

You can deploy a trial (evaluation) {PRODUCT} environment. It consists of {CENTRAL} for authoring or managing services and {KIE_SERVER} for test execution of services. 

This environment does not include permanent storage. Assets that you create or modify in a trial environment are not saved. 

The procedure is minimal. There are no required settings and all passwords are set to a single value (the default password is `RedHat`).

To deploy a single authoring environment, use the `{PRODUCT_INIT}{ENTERPRISE_VERSION_SHORT}-trial-ephemeral.yaml` template file. You can extract this file from the `{PRODUCT_FILE}-openshift-templates.zip` product deliverable file. You can download the file from the {PRODUCT_DOWNLOAD_LINK}[Software Downloads] page.

.Procedure

. Use one of the following methods to deploy the template:
* In the OpenShift Web UI, select *Add to Project -> Import YAML / JSON* and then select or paste the `{PRODUCT_INIT}{ENTERPRISE_VERSION_SHORT}-trial-ephemeral.yaml` file. In the *Add Template* window, ensure *Process the template* is selected and click *Continue*.
* To use the OpenShift command line console, prepare the following command line:
+
[subs="attributes,verbatim,macros"]
----
oc new-app -f <template-path>/{PRODUCT_INIT}{ENTERPRISE_VERSION_SHORT}-trial-ephemeral.yaml  
----
+
In this command line, replace `<template-path>` with the path to the downloaded template file.
. Optionally, set any parameters as described in the template. However, a typical trial deployment does not require any parameters.
. Complete the creation of the environment, depending on the method that you are using:
* In the OpenShift Web UI, click *Create*.
** A `This will create resources that may have security or project behavior implications` pop-up message might be displayed. If it is displayed, click *Create Anyway*.
* Complete and run the command line.
