= Deploying a trial environment

You can deploy a trial (evaluation) {PRODUCT} environment. It consists of {CENTRAL} for authoring or managing services and {KIE_SERVER} for test execution of services. 

This environment does not include permanent storage. Assets that you create or modify in a trial environment are not saved. 

This environment is intended for test and demonstration access. It supports cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). This means that {KIE_SERVER} endpoints can be accessed using a browser when other resources on the page are provided by other servers. {KIE_SERVER} endpoints are normally intended for REST calls, but browser access can be needed in some demonstration configurations. 

The procedure is minimal. There are no required settings and all passwords are set to a single value (the default password is `RedHat`).

To deploy a single authoring environment, use the `{PRODUCT_INIT}{ENTERPRISE_VERSION_SHORT}-trial-ephemeral.yaml` template file. You can extract this file from the `{PRODUCT_FILE}-openshift-templates.zip` product deliverable file. You can download the file from the {PRODUCT_DOWNLOAD_LINK}[Software Downloads] page of the Red Hat Customer Portal.

.Procedure

. Use one of the following methods to deploy the template:
* In the OpenShift Web UI, select *Add to Project -> Import YAML / JSON* and then select or paste the `{PRODUCT_INIT}{ENTERPRISE_VERSION_SHORT}-trial-ephemeral.yaml` file. In the *Add Template* window, ensure *Process the template* is selected and click *Continue*.
* To use the OpenShift command line console, prepare the following command line:
+
[subs="attributes,verbatim,macros"]
----
oc new-app -f <template-path>/{PRODUCT_INIT}{ENTERPRISE_VERSION_SHORT}-trial-ephemeral.yaml  
----
+
In this command line, replace `<template-path>` with the path to the downloaded template file.
. Optionally, set any parameters as described in the template. A typical trial deployment requires only the following parameter:
** *ImageStream Namespace* (`IMAGE_STREAM_NAMESPACE`): The namespace where the image streams are available. If the image streams were already available in your OpenShift environment (see <<imagestreams-file-install-proc>>), the namespace is `openshift`. If you installed the image streams file, the namespace is the name of the OpenShift project.
. Complete the creation of the environment, depending on the method that you are using:
* In the OpenShift Web UI, click *Create*.
** A `This will create resources that may have security or project behavior implications` pop-up message might be displayed. If it is displayed, click *Create Anyway*.
* Complete and run the command line.
