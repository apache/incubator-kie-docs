= Implementing the HA CEP server with a Maven repository for updating the KJAR service

You can implement the HA CEP server that retrieves the KJAR service and all dependencies from a Maven repository that you provide. In this case, you can update the KJAR service at any time by updating it in the Maven repository and then making a call from the client code.

Prepare the source, build it, and then deploy it on {OPENSHIFT}. Set certain environment variables in the `deployment.yaml` file before deploying the server. To use a Maven repository, you must set the `UPDATABLEKJAR` variable to `true`.

.Prerequisites

* You are logged into the project with administrator privilege using the `oc` command-line tool.
* You configured a Maven repository that is accessible from your {OPENSHIFT} environment.

.Procedure

.  Download the `{PRODUCT_FILE}-reference-implementation.zip` product deliverable file from the {PRODUCT_DOWNLOAD_LINK}[Software Downloads] page of the Red Hat Customer Portal.
. Extract the contents of the file and then uncompress the `{PRODUCT_FILE}-openshift-drools-hacep-distribution.zip` file.
. Change to the `openshift-drools-hacep-distribution/sources` directory.
. Review and modify the server code based on the sample project in the `sample-hacep-project/sample-hacep-project-kjar` directory. The complex event processing logic is defined by the DRL rules in the `src/main/resources/org/drools/cep` subdirectory.
. Build the project using the standard Maven command:
+
----
mvn clean install -DskipTests
----
+
Upload the resulting KJAR and any required dependencies to the Maven repository.
+
. Enable the OpenShift operator for Red Hat AMQ Streams and then create an AMQ Streams (kafka) cluster in the project. For information about installing Red Hat AMQ Streams, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_amq/7.7/html/using_amq_streams_on_openshift/[_Using AMQ Streams on OpenShift_].
. To create the kafka topics that are required for operation of the server, remain in the `openshift-drools-hacep-distribution/sources` directory and run the following commands:
+
----
oc apply -f kafka-topics/control.yaml
oc apply -f kafka-topics/events.yaml
oc apply -f kafka-topics/kiesessioninfos.yaml
oc apply -f kafka-topics/snapshot.yaml
----
+
. In order to enable application access to the ConfigMap that is used in the leader election, configure role-based access control. Change to the `springboot` directory and enter the following commands:
+
----
oc create -f kubernetes/service-account.yaml
oc create -f kubernetes/role.yaml
oc create -f kubernetes/role-binding.yaml
----
+
For more information about configuring role-based access control in {OPENSHIFT}, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.6/html/authentication_and_authorization/using-rbac[Using RBAC to define and apply permissions] in the {OPENSHIFT} product documentation.
+
. In the `springboot` directory, edit the `pom.xml` file to remove the following dependency:
+
----
<dependency>
      <groupId>org.kie</groupId>
      <artifactId>sample-hacep-project-kjar</artifactId>
</dependency>
----
+
. In the `springboot` directory, enter the following commands to create the image for deployment and push it into the repository configured for your OpenShift environment:
+
----
oc new-build --binary --strategy=docker --name openshift-kie-springboot
oc start-build openshift-kie-springboot --from-dir=. --follow
----
+
. Enter the following command to detect the name of the image that was built:
+
----
oc get is/openshift-kie-springboot -o template --template='{{range .status.tags}}{{range .items}}{{.dockerImageReference}}{{end}}{{end}}'
----
+
. Open the `kubernetes/deployment.yaml` file in a text editor.
. Replace the existing image URL with the result of the previous command.
. Remove all characters at the end of the line starting with the `@` symbol, then add `:latest` to the line. For example:
+
----
image: image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/hacep/openshift-kie-springboot:latest
----
+
. Under the `containers:` line and the `env:` line, set environment variables as in the following example:
+
----
containers:
  - env:
    - name: UPDATABLEKJAR
      value: "true"
    - name: KJARGAV
      value: <GroupID>:<ArtifactID>:<Version>
    - name: MAVEN_LOCAL_REPO
      value: /app/.m2/repository
    - name: MAVEN_MIRROR_URL
      value: http://<nexus_url>/repository/maven-releases/
    - name: MAVEN_SETTINGS_XML
      value: /app/.m2/settings.xml
----
+
In this example, replace the value of the `KJARGAV` variable with the group, artifact, and version (GAV) of your KJAR service and the value of the `MAVEN_MIRROR_URL` variable with the URL to the Maven repository that contains your KJAR service.
+
Optionally, set other variables. For a list of supported environment variables, see <<hacep-server-environment-ref_{context}>>.
. Save the file.
+
. Enter the following command to deploy the image:
+
----
oc apply -f kubernetes/deployment.yaml
----
