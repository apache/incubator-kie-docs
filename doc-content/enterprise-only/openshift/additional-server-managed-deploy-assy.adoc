:what_deploying: an additional managed {KIE_SERVER}
:what_deploying_brief: an additional managed {KIE_SERVER}

You can deploy an additional managed {KIE_SERVER} to an authoring or managed environment.  Deploy the server in the same project as the {LOCAL_CENTRAL} deployment.

The {KIE_SERVER} loads services from a Maven repository. You must configure the server to use either the {CENTRAL} built-in repository or an external repository.

The server starts with no loaded services. Use {LOCAL_CENTRAL} or the REST API of the {KIE_SERVER} to deploy and undeploy services on the server.
