= Creating a custom {KIE_SERVER} image with an additional JAR file

You can create a custom {KIE_SERVER} image where an additional JAR file (or several JAR files) is installed to extend the capabilities of the server. You can push this image into your custom registry and then use it to deploy {KIE_SERVER}.

For example, you can create a custom class JAR to provide custom Prometheus metrics in {KIE_SERVER}. For instructions about creating the custom class, see {URL_MANAGING_SETTINGS}#prometheus-monitoring-custom-proc_execution-server[Extending Prometheus metrics monitoring in KIE Server with custom metrics] in _{MANAGING_KIE_SERVER}_.

.Procedure

. Develop a custom library that works with {KIE_SERVER}. You can use the following documentation and examples to develop the library:
** {URL_MANAGING_SETTINGS}#kie-server-extensions-con_execution-server[{KIE_SERVER} capabilities and extensions] in _{MANAGING_KIE_SERVER}_.
** https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2019/10/31/domain-specific-prometheus-metrics-with-red-hat-process-automation-manager-and-decision-manager/[Domain-specific Prometheus metrics with Red Hat Process Automation Manager and Decision Manager]
** http://mswiderski.blogspot.com/2015/12/kie-server-extend-kie-server-with.html[Extend KIE Server with additional transport]
. Build the library using Maven, so that the JAR file is placed in the `target` directory. This example uses the `custom-kieserver-ext-1.0.0.Final.jar` file name.
include::customimage-download-step.adoc[]
. Create a `Dockerfile` that defines a custom image based on the base image. The file must copy the JAR file (or several JAR files) into the `/opt/eap/standalone/deployments/ROOT.war/WEB-INF/lib/` directory. The following example shows the content of the `Dockerfile` file:
+
[subs="attributes,verbatim,macros,quotes"]
----
FROM registry.redhat.io/{PRODUCT_INIT}-7/{PRODUCT_INIT}-kieserver-rhel8:{ENTERPRISE_VERSION_LONG}
COPY target/custom-kieserver-ext-1.0.0.Final.jar /opt/eap/standalone/deployments/ROOT.war/WEB-INF/lib/
----
