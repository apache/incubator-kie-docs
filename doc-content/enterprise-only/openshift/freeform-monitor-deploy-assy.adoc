= Deploying monitoring and a single {KIE_SERVER} for a freeform environment

:subcontext: {context}-freeform-monitor
:LOCAL_CENTRAL: {CENTRAL} Monitoring
:what_deploying: {CENTRAL} Monitoring and a single managed {KIE_SERVER}
:what_deploying_brief: monitoring and a single {KIE_SERVER}


To start deploying a freeform environment, deploy {CENTRAL} Monitoring and a single managed {KIE_SERVER} instance, which uses a PostgreSQL database server in a pod. No services are loaded on the deployed {KIE_SERVER} instance. Use {LOCAL_CENTRAL} to deploy and undeploy services on the server.

You can then add more {KIE_SERVER} instances as necessary.
