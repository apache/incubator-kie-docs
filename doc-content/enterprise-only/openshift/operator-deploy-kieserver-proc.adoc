= Setting custom {KIE_SERVER} configuration of the environment

Every environment type in {operator_name} includes one or several {KIE_SERVERS} by default.

Optionally, you can set custom configuration for {KIE_SERVERS}. In this case, default {KIE_SERVERS} are not created and only the {KIE_SERVERS} that you configure are deployed.

.Prerequisites

* You completed basic configuration of a {PRODUCT} environment using {operator_name} in the installer wizard according to the instructions in <<operator-deploy-basic-proc_{context}>>.
* If you want to use RH-SSO or LDAP for authentication, you completed security configuration according to the instructions in <<operator-deploy-security-proc_{context}>>.

.Procedure
. If the *Installation*, *Security*, or *Console* tab is open, click *Next* until you view the *KIE Servers* tab.
. Click *Add new KIE Server* to add a new {KIE_SERVER} configuration.
. In the *Id* field, enter an identifier for the {KIE_SERVER}. If the {KIE_SERVER} connects to a {CENTRAL} or {CENTRAL} Monitoring instance, this identifier determines which server group the server joins.
. In the *Name* field, enter a name for the {KIE_SERVER}.
. In the *Deployments* field, enter the number of similar {KIE_SERVERS} that are to be deployed. The installer can deploy several {KIE_SERVERS} with the same configuration. The identifiers and names of the {KIE_SERVERS} are modified automatically and remain unique.
. If you created the secret for {KIE_SERVER} according to the instructions in <<secrets-kie-create-proc_{context}>>, enter the name of the secret in the *Keystore secret* field.
. Optionally, enter the number of replicas for the {KIE_SERVER} in the *Replicas* field.
. If you want to use a custom image for the {KIE_SERVER}, complete the following additional steps:
.. Click *Set KIE Server image*.
.. If you want to use a Docker image name and not an OpenShift image stream tag, change the *Kind* value to `DockerImage`.
.. Enter the name of the image stream in the *Name* field.
.. If the image stream is not in the `openshift` namespace, enter the namespace in the *Namespace* field.
+
For instructions about creating custom images, see xref:customimage-con_{context}[].
+
. If you want to configure an immutable {KIE_SERVER} using a Source to Image (S2I) build, complete the following additional steps:
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you want to configure an immutable {KIE_SERVER} that pulls services from the Maven repository, do not click *Set Immutable server configuration* and do not complete these steps. Instead, set the `KIE_SERVER_CONTAINER_REPLOYMENT` environment variable.
====
+
.. Click *Set Immutable server configuration*.
.. In the *KIE Server container deployment* field, enter the identifying information of the services (KJAR files) that the deployment must extract from the result of a Source to Image (S2I) build. The format is `<containerId>=<groupId>:<artifactId>:<version>` or, if you want to specify an alias name for the container, `<containerId>(<aliasId>)=<groupId>:<artifactId>:<version>`. You can provide two or more KJAR files using the `|` separator, as illustrated in the following example: `containerId=groupId:artifactId:version|c2(alias2)=g2:a2:v2`.
.. If your OpenShift environment does not have a connection to the public Internet, enter the URL of the Maven mirror that you set up according to <<offline-repo-proc_{context}>> in the *Maven mirror URL* field.
.. In the *Artifact directory* field, enter the path within the project that contains the required binary files (KJAR files and any other necessary files) after a successful Maven build. Normally this directory is the target directory of the build. However, you can provide prebuilt binaries in this directory in the Git repository.
.. If you want to use a custom base {KIE_SERVER} image for the S2I build, click *Set Base build image* and then enter the name of the image stream in the *Name* field. If the image stream is not in the `openshift` namespace, enter the namespace in the *Namespace* field. If you want to use a Docker image name and not an OpenShift image stream tag, change the *Kind* value to `DockerImage`.
.. Click *Set Git source* and enter information in the following fields:
*** *S2I Git URI*:The URI for the Git repository that contains the source for your services.
*** *Reference*: The branch in the Git repository.
*** *Context directory*: (Optional) The path to the source within the project downloaded from the Git repository. By default, the root directory of the downloaded project is the source directory.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you do not configure a Git source, the immutable {KIE_SERVER} does not use an S2I build. Instead, it pulls the artifacts that you define in the *KIE Server container deployment* field from the configured Maven repository.
====
+
.. If you are using S2I and want to set a Git Webhook so that changes in the Git repository cause an automatic rebuild of the {KIE_SERVER}, click *Add new Webhook*. Then select the type of the Webhook in the *Type* field and enter the secret string for the Webhook in the *Secret* field.
.. If you want to set a build environment variable for the S2I build, click *Add new Build Config Environment variable* and then enter the name and value for the variable in the *Name* and *Value* fields.
. Optionally, enter requested and maximum CPU and memory limits in the fields under *Resource quotas*. If you are configuring several {KIE_SERVERS}, the limits apply to each server separately.
. If you selected RH-SSO authentication, configure RH-SSO for the {KIE_SERVER}:
.. Enter the client name in the *Client name* field and the client secret in the *Client secret* field. If a client with this name does not exist, the deployment attempts to create a new client with this name and secret.
.. If the deployment is to create a new client, enter the HTTP and HTTPS URLs that will be used for accessing the {KIE_SERVER} into the *SSO HTTP URL* and *SSO HTTPS URL* fields. This information is recorded in the client.
. If you want to interact with the {KIE_SERVER} through JMS API using an external AMQ message broker, enable the *Enable JMS Integration* setting. Additional fields for configuring JMS Integration are displayed and you must enter the values as necessary:
* *User name*, *Password*: The user name and password of a standard broker user, if user authentication in the broker is required in your environment.
* *Executor*: Select this setting to disable the JMS executor. The executor is enabled by default.
* *Executor transacted*: Select this setting to enable JMS transactions on the executor queue.
* *Enable signal*: Select this setting to enable signal configuration through JMS.
* *Enable audit*: Select this setting to enable audit logging through JMS.
* *Audit transacted*: Select this setting to enable JMS transactions on the audit queue.
* *Queue executor*, *Queue request*, *Queue response*, *Queue signal*, *Queue audit*: Custom JNDI names of the queues to use. If you set any of these values, you must also set the *AMQ queues* parameter.
* *AMQ Queues*: AMQ queue names, separated by commas. These queues are automatically created when the broker starts and are accessible as JNDI resources in the JBoss EAP server. If you are using any custom queue names, you must enter the names of all the queues uses by the server in this field.
* *Enable SSL integration*: Select this setting if you want to use an SSL connection to the AMQ broker. In this case you must also provide the name of the secret that you created in <<secrets-amq-create-proc_{context}>> and the names and passwords of the key store and trust store that you used for the secret.
. If you want to customize the configuration of the Java virtual machine on the {KIE_SERVER} pods, select the *Enable JVM configuration* box and then enter information in any of the fields under *Enable JVM configuration*. All fields are optional. For the JVM parameters that you can configure, see <<jvm-settings-ref_{context}>>.

. In the *Database type* field, select the database that the {KIE_SERVER} must use. The following values are available:
** `mysql`: A MySQL server, created in a separate pod.
** `postgresql`: A PostgreSQL server, created in a separate pod. Use this setting unless you have a specific reason to use any other setting.
** `h2`: A built-in `h2` database engine that does not require a separate pod. Do not scale the {KIE_SERVER} pod if you use this setting.
** `external`: An external database server.
. If you selected any database except `external`, a Persistent Volume Claim will be created to store the database. Optionally, set configuration parameters for the persistent volume:
** In the *Size* field, enter the size of the persistence volume.
** In the *StorageClass name* field, enter the storage class name for the persistent volume.
. Optionally, if you selected the `external` database, configure the {KIE_SERVER} extension image. If you want to use any database server except PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MariaDB, you must provide a {KIE_SERVER} extension image with the database server driver according to instructions in <<externaldb-build-proc_{context}>>. To configure the {KIE_SERVER} to use this extension image, make the following changes:
.. Select the *Enable extension image stream* box.
.. In the *Extension image stream tag* field, enter the ImageStreamTag definition for the image that you created, for example, `jboss-kie-db2-extension-openshift-image:11.1.4.4`
.. Optionally, in the *Extension image stream namespace* field, enter the namespace into which you pushed the image. If you do not enter any value in this field, the operator expects the image to be in the `openshift` namespace.
.. Optionally, in the *Extension image install directory* field, enter the directory within the extensions image where the extensions are located. If you used the procedure in <<externaldb-build-proc_{context}>> to build the image, do not enter any value for this field.
. If you selected an external database server, provide the following information in additional fields:
.. *Driver*: Enter the database server driver, depending on the server type:
+
*** `mysql`
*** `postgresql`
*** `mariadb`
*** `mssql`
*** `db2`
*** `oracle`
*** `sybase`
+
.. *Dialect*: Enter the Hibernate dialect for the server, depending on the server type. The common settings are:
+
*** `org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL5InnoDBDialect`
*** `org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL8Dialect`
*** `org.hibernate.dialect.MariaDB102Dialect`
*** `org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQL95Dialect`
*** `org.hibernate.dialect.PostgresPlusDialect` (used for EntrepriseDB Postgres Advanced Server)
*** `org.hibernate.dialect.SQLServer2012Dialect` (used for MS SQL)
*** `org.hibernate.dialect.DB2Dialect`
*** `org.hibernate.dialect.Oracle10gDialect`
*** `org.hibernate.dialect.SybaseASE15Dialect`
+
For a complete list of supported dialects, see the _Hibernate SQL Dialects_ table in https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_enterprise_application_platform/7.3/html-single/developing_hibernate_applications/index#hibernate_properties[Hibernate properties] in the {EAP} documentation.
+
.. *Host*: Enter the host name of the external database server.
.. *Port*: Enter the port number of the external database server.
.. *Jdbc URL*: Enter the JDBC URL for the external database server.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you are using the EntrepriseDB Postgres database server, use an URL starting with `jdbc:postgresql://` and not with `jdbc:edb://`. Alternatively, do not set the URL and set the host and port parameters instead.
====
+
.. *NonXA*: Select this box if you want to configure the data source in non-XA mode.
.. *JNDI name*: Enter the JNDI name that the application uses for the data source.
.. *User name* and *Password*: Enter the user name and password for the external database server.
.. *Background validation*: Optionally, select this box to enable background SQL validation and enter the background validation interval.
.. Optionally, set the minimum and maximum connection pool sizes, valid connection checker class, and exception sorter class for the database server.
. If you are using a MySQL version 8 external database server, enable the `mysql_native_password` plugin and use it for authentication. For instructions about this pluding, see https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/native-pluggable-authentication.html[Native Pluggable Authentication] in the _MySQL 8.0 Reference Manual_.
+
If you are using a MySQL version 8 image provided by Red Hat on {OPENSHIFT}, to enable the plugin, set the `MYSQL_DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_PLUGIN` environment variable to `mysql_native_password`.
+
If you created users on the MySQL version 8 server before enabling the `mysql_native_password` plugin, you must update the `mysql-user` table after you enable the plugin.

. Optionally, depending on your needs, set environment variables. To set an environment variable, click *Add new Environment variable*, then enter the name and value for the variable in the *Name* and *Value* fields.
** If you want to configure an immutable KIE server that pulls services from the configured Maven repository, enter the following settings:
... Set the `KIE_SERVER_CONTAINER_DEPLOYMENT` environment variable. The variable must contain the identifying information of the services (KJAR files) that the deployment must pull from the Maven repository. The format is `<containerId>=<groupId>:<artifactId>:<version>` or, if you want to specify an alias name for the container, `<containerId>(<aliasId>)=<groupId>:<artifactId>:<version>`. You can provide two or more KJAR files using the `|` separator, as illustrated in the following example: `containerId=groupId:artifactId:version|c2(alias2)=g2:a2:v2`.
... Configure an external Maven repository.
** If you want to configure an external Maven repository, set the following variables:
*** `MAVEN_REPO_URL`: The URL for the Maven repository
*** `MAVEN_REPO_ID`: An identifier for the Maven repository, for example, `repo-custom`
*** `MAVEN_REPO_USERNAME`: The user name for the Maven repository
*** `MAVEN_REPO_PASSWORD`: The password for the Maven repository
** If your OpenShift environment does not have a connection to the public Internet, configure access to a Maven mirror that you set up according to <<offline-repo-proc_{context}>>. Set the following variables:
*** `MAVEN_MIRROR_URL`: The URL for the Maven mirror repository that you set up in <<offline-repo-proc_{context}>>. This URL must be accessible from a pod in your OpenShift environment. If you configured this {KIE_SERVER} as S2I, you already entered this URL.
*** `MAVEN_MIRROR_OF`: The value that determines which artifacts are to be retrieved from the mirror. If you configured this {KIE_SERVER} as S2I, do not set this value. For instructions about setting the `mirrorOf` value, see https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-mirror-settings.html[Mirror Settings] in the Apache Maven documentation. The default value is `external:*`. With this value, Maven retrieves every required artifact from the mirror and does not query any other repositories.
+
If you configure an external Maven repository (`MAVEN_REPO_URL`), change `MAVEN_MIRROR_OF` to exclude the artifacts in this repository from the mirror, for example, `external:*,!repo-custom`. Replace `repo-custom` with the ID that you configured in `MAVEN_REPO_ID`.
+
If your authoring environment uses a built-in {CENTRAL} Maven repository, change `MAVEN_MIRROR_OF` to exclude the artifacts in this repository from the mirror: `external:*,!repo-{PRODUCT_INIT}centr`.
+
** If you want to configure your {KIE_SERVER} deployment to use Prometheus to collect and store metrics, set the `PROMETHEUS_SERVER_EXT_DISABLED` environment variable to `false`. For instructions about configuring Prometheus metrics collection, see {URL_MANAGING_SETTINGS}#prometheus-monitoring-ocp-proc_execution-server[_{MANAGING_KIE_SERVER}_].
** If you are using {RH-SSO} authentication and the interaction of your application with {RH-SSO} requires support for CORS, set the `SSO_ENABLE_CORS` variable to `true`.
** In some authoring environments, you might need to ensure that several users can deploy services on the same {KIE_SERVER} at the same time. By default, after deploying a service onto a {KIE_SERVER} using {CENTRAL}, the user needs to wait for some seconds before more services can be deployed. The `OpenShiftStartupStrategy` setting is enabled by default and causes this limitation. To remove the limitation, you can configure an `{PRODUCT_INIT}-authoring` environment to use the _controller strategy_. Do not make this change unless a specific need for it exists; if you decide to enable controller strategy, make this change on {CENTRAL} and on all {KIE_SERVERS} in the same environment.
+
[NOTE]
====
Do not enable the controller strategy in an environment with a high-availability {CENTRAL}. In such environments the controller strategy does not function correctly.
====
+
To enable controller strategy on a {KIE_SERVER}, set the  `KIE_SERVER_STARTUP_STRATEGY` environment variable to `ControllerBasedStartupStrategy` and the `KIE_SERVER_CONTROLLER_OPENSHIFT_ENABLED` environment variable to `false`.
