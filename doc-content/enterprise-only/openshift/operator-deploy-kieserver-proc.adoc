= Setting custom {KIE_SERVER} configuration of the environment

Every environment type in {operator_name} includes one or several {KIE_SERVERS} by default.

Optionally, you can set custom configuration for {KIE_SERVERS}. In this case, default {KIE_SERVERS} are not created and only the {KIE_SERVERS} that you configure are deployed.

.Prerequisites

* You completed basic configuration of a {PRODUCT} environment using {operator_name} in the installer wizard according to the instructions in <<operator-deploy-basic-proc>>.
* If you want to use RH-SSO or LDAP for authentication, you completed security configuration according to the instructions in <<operator-deploy-security-proc>>.

.Procedure
. If the *Installation*, *Security*, or *Console* tab is open, click *Next* until you view the *KIE Servers* tab.
. Click *Add new KIE Server* to add a new {KIE_SERVER} configuration.
. In the *Id* field, enter an identifier for the {KIE_SERVER}. If the {KIE_SERVER} connects to a {CENTRAL} or {CENTRAL} Monitoring instance, this identifier determines which server group the server joins.
. In the *Name* field, enter a name for the {KIE_SERVER}.
. In the *Deployments* field, enter the number of similar {KIE_SERVERS} that are to be deployed. The installer can deploy several {KIE_SERVERS} with the same configuration. The identifiers and names of the {KIE_SERVERS} are modified automatically and remain unique.
. If you created the secret for {KIE_SERVER} according to the instructions in <<secrets-kie-create-proc>>, enter the name of the secret in the *Secret* field.
. Optionally, enter the number of replicas for the {KIE_SERVER} in the *Replicas* field.
. If you want to use a custom image for the {KIE_SERVER}, 
ifdef::PAM[]
for example, if you created an image with an external database driver according to instructions in <<externaldb-build-proc>>, 
endif::PAM[]
complete the following additional steps:
.. Click *Set KIE Server image*.
.. Enter the name of the image stream in the *Name* field. 
ifdef::PAM[]
If you created a custom image for using an external database server other than MySQL or PostgreSQL, as described in <<externaldb-build-proc>>, enter the following value:
+
*** For Microsoft SQL Server, `{PRODUCT_INIT}{ENTERPRISE_VERSION_SHORT}-kieserver-mssql-openshift`
*** For MariaDB, `{PRODUCT_INIT}{ENTERPRISE_VERSION_SHORT}-kieserver-mariadb-openshift`
*** For IBM DB2, `{PRODUCT_INIT}{ENTERPRISE_VERSION_SHORT}-kieserver-db2-openshift`
*** For Oracle Database, `{PRODUCT_INIT}{ENTERPRISE_VERSION_SHORT}-kieserver-oracle-openshift`
*** For Sybase, `{PRODUCT_INIT}{ENTERPRISE_VERSION_SHORT}-kieserver-sybase-openshift`
+
endif::PAM[]
.. If the image stream is not in the `openshift` namespace, enter the namespace in the *Namespace* field.
. If you want to configure an immutable {KIE_SERVER}, complete the following additional steps:
.. Click *Set Immutable server configuration*.
.. In the *KIE Server container deployment* field, enter the identifying information of the decision services (KJAR files) that the deployment must pull from the Maven repository. The format is: `<containerId>=<groupId>:<artifactId>:<version>`. You can provide two or more KJAR files using the `|` separator, as illustrated in the following example: `containerId=groupId:artifactId:version|c2=g2:a2:v2`.
.. If your OpenShift environment does not have a connection to the public Internet, enter the URL of the Maven mirror that you set up according to <<offline-repo-proc>> in the *Maven mirror URL* field.
.. In the *Artifact directory* field, enter the path within the project that contains the required binary files (KJAR files and any other necessary files) after a successful Maven build. Normally this directory is the target directory of the build. However, you can provide prebuilt binaries in this directory in the Git repository.
.. If you want to create the immutable server from source in a Git repository using the Source to Image (S2I) process, click the *Set Git source* button and enter information in the following fields:
*** *S2I Git URI*:The URI for the Git repository that contains the source for your services.
*** *Reference*: The branch in the Git repository.
*** *Context directory*: (Optional) The path to the source within the project downloaded from the Git repository. By default, the root directory of the downloaded project is the source directory.
.. If you are using S2I and want to set a Git Webhook so that changes in the Git repository cause an automatic rebuild of the {KIE_SERVER}, click *Add new Webhook*. Then select the type of the Webhook in the *Type* field and enter the secret string for the Webhook in the *Secret* field.
.. If you want to use a custom base {KIE_SERVER} image for the S2I build, click *Set Base build image*. Then enter the name of the image stream in the *Name* field. If the image stream is not in the `openshift` namespace, enter the namespace in the *Namespace* field.
. Optionally, enter requested and maximum CPU and memory limits in the fields under *Resource quotas*. If you are configuring several {KIE_SERVERS}, the limits apply to each server separately.
. If you selected RH-SSO authentication, configure RH-SSO for the {KIE_SERVER}:
.. Enter the client name in the *Client name* field and the client secret in the *Client secret* field. If a client with this name does not exist, the deployment attempts to create a new client with this name and secret.
.. If the deployment is to create a new client, enter the HTTP and HTTPS URLs that will be used for accessing the {KIE_SERVER} into the *SSO HTTP URL* and *SSO HTTPS URL* fields. This information is recorded in the client.
ifdef::PAM[]
. Select the database that the {KIE_SERVER} must use. The following values are available:
** `mysql`: A MySQL server, created in a separate pod.
** `postgresql`: A PostgreSQL server, created in a separate pod. Use this setting unless you have a specific reason to use any other setting.
** `h2`: A built-in `h2` database engine that does not require a separate pod. Do not scape the {KIE_SERVER} pod if you use this setting.
** `external`: An external database server. If you use any database server except PostgreSQL or MySQL, you must provide a {KIE_SERVER} image with the database server driver according to instructions in <<externaldb-build-proc>>.
. Optionally, in the *Size* field, enter the size of the peristence volume to create for the database server.
. If you selected an external database server, provide the following information in additional fields:
.. *Driver*: Enter the database server driver, depending on the server type:
+
*** `mysql`
*** `postgresql`
*** `mariadb`
*** `mssql`
*** `db2`
*** `oracle`
*** `sybase`
+
.. *Dialect*: Enter the Hibernate dialect for the server, depending on the server type:
+
*** `org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL5InnoDBDialect` (used for MySQL and MariaDB)
*** `org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQL82Dialect`
*** `org.hibernate.dialect.SQLServer2012Dialect` (used for MS SQL)
*** `org.hibernate.dialect.DB2Dialect`
*** `org.hibernate.dialect.Oracle10gDialect`
*** `org.hibernate.dialect.SybaseASE157Dialect`
+
.. *Host*: Enter the host name of the external database server.
.. *Port*: Enter the port number of the external database server.
.. *Jdbc URL*: Enter the JDBC URL for the external database server.
.. *NonXA*: Select this box if you want to configure the data source in non-XA mode.
.. *JNDI name*: Enter the JNDI name that the application uses for the data source.
.. *User name* and *Password*: Enter the user name and password for the external database server.
.. *Background validation*: Optionally, select this box to enable background SQL valication and enter the background validation interval.
.. Optionally, set the minimum and maximum connection pool sizes, valid connection checker class, and exception sorter class for the database server.
endif::PAM[]
. Optionally, depending on your needs, set environment variables. To set an environment variable, click *Add new Environment variable*, then enter the name and value for the variable in the *Name* and *Value* fields.
** If you want to configure your {KIE_SERVER} deployment to use Prometheus to collect and store metrics, set the `PROMETHEUS_SERVER_EXT_DISABLED` environment variable to `false`. For instructions about configuring Prometheus metrics collection, see {URL_MANAGING_KIE_SERVER}#prometheus-monitoring-ocp-proc_execution-server[_{MANAGING_KIE_SERVER}_].
** If you want to use an external Maven repository, set the following variables:
*** `MAVEN_REPO_URL`: The URL for the Maven repository
*** `MAVEN_REPO_ID`: An identifier for the Maven repository, for example, `repo-custom`
*** `MAVEN_REPO_USERNAME`: The user name for the Maven repository
*** `MAVEN_REPO_PASSWORD`: The password for the Maven repository
** If your OpenShift environment does not have a connection to the public Internet, configure access to a Maven mirror that you set up according to <<offline-repo-proc>>. Set the following variables:
*** `MAVEN_MIRROR_URL`: The URL for the Maven mirror repository that you set up in <<offline-repo-proc>>. This URL must be accessible from a pod in your OpenShift environment. If you configured this {KIE_SERVER} as S2I, you already entered this URL.
*** `MAVEN_MIRROR_OF`: The value that determines which artifacts are to be retrieved from the mirror. If you configured this {KIE_SERVER} as S2I, do not set this value. For instructions about setting the `mirrorOf` value, see https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-mirror-settings.html[Mirror Settings] in the Apache Maven documentation. The default value is `external:*`. With this value, Maven retrieves every required artifact from the mirror and does not query any other repositories.
+
If you configure an external Maven repository (`MAVEN_REPO_URL`), change `MAVEN_MIRROR_OF` to exclude the artifacts in this repository from the mirror, for example, `external:*,!repo-custom`. Replace `repo-custom` with the ID that you configured in `MAVEN_REPO_ID`.
+
If your authoring environment uses a built-in {CENTRAL} Maven repository, change `MAVEN_MIRROR_OF` to exclude the artifacts in this repository from the mirror: `external:*,!repo-{PRODUCT_INIT}centr`.
