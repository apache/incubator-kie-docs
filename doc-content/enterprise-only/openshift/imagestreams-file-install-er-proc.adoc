= Ensuring the availability of image streams and the image registry

To deploy the Employee Rostering starter application on {OPENSHIFT}, you must ensure that OpenShift can download the correct images from the Red Hat registry. To download the images, OpenShift requires the information about their location (known as _image streams_). OpenShift also must be configured to authenticate with the Red Hat registry using your service account user name and password.

Some versions of the OpenShift environment include the required image streams. You must check if they are available. If image streams are available in OpenShift by default, you can use them if the OpenShift infrastructure is configured for registry authentication server. The administrator must complete the registry authentication configuration when installing the OpenShift environment.

.Procedure
. Determine whether {OPENSHIFT} is configured with the user name and password for Red Hat registry access. For details about the required configuration, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/3.11/html/installing_clusters/install-config-configuring-inventory-file#advanced-install-configuring-registry-location[Configuring a Registry Location]. If you are using an OpenShift Online subscription, it is configured for Red Hat registry access.

. If {OPENSHIFT} is configured with the user name and password for Red Hat registry access, run the following command:
+
[subs="attributes,verbatim,macros"]
----
$ oc get imagestreamtag -n openshift | grep rhdm-optaweb-employee-rostering | grep {ENTERPRISE_VERSION}
----
+
If the output of the command is not empty, the required image streams are available in the `openshift` namespace and no further action is required.
+
. If the output of the command is empty or if OpenShift is not configured with the user name and password for Red Hat registry access, complete the following steps:
.. Ensure you are logged in to OpenShift with the `oc` command and that your project is active.

.. Complete the steps documented in https://access.redhat.com/RegistryAuthentication#registry-service-accounts-for-shared-environments-4[Registry Service Accounts for Shared Environments]. You must log in to Red Hat Customer Portal to access the document and to complete the steps to create a registry service account.
.. Select the *OpenShift Secret* tab and click the link under *Download secret* to download the YAML secret file.
.. View the downloaded file and note the name that is listed in the `name:` entry.
.. Enter the following commands:
+
[subs="attributes,verbatim,macros"]
----
oc create -f <file_name>.yaml
oc secrets link default <secret_name> --for=pull
oc secrets link builder <secret_name> --for=pull
----
+
Replace `<file_name>` with the name of the downloaded file and `<secret_name>` with the name that is listed in the `name:` entry of the file.
.. Download the `rhdm-{PRODUCT_VERSION_LONG}-openshift-templates.zip` file from the https://access.redhat.com/jbossnetwork/restricted/listSoftware.html?downloadType=distributions&product=rhdm&productChanged=yes[Software Downloads] page for Red Hat Decision Manager {PRODUCT_VERSION}.
.. Extract the `rhdm{ENTERPRISE_VERSION_SHORT}-image-streams.yaml` file.
..  Enter the following command:
+
[subs="attributes,verbatim,macros"]
----
$ oc apply -f rhdm{ENTERPRISE_VERSION_SHORT}-image-streams.yaml
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If you complete these steps, you install the image streams into the namespace of your project. If you install the image streams using these steps, you must set the `IMAGE_STREAM_NAMESPACE` parameter to the name of this project when deploying templates.
