= Building a custom {KIE_SERVER} extension image for an external database

If you want to use an external database server for a {KIE_SERVER} and the database server is not a MySQL or PostgreSQL server, you must build a custom {KIE_SERVER} extension image with drivers for this server before deploying your environment.

Complete the steps in this build procedure to provide drivers for any of the following database servers:

* Microsoft SQL Server
* IBM DB2
* Oracle Database
* Sybase

Optionally, you can use this procedure to build a new version of drivers for any of the following database servers:

* MySQL
* MariaDB
* PostgreSQL

For the supported versions of the database servers, see https://access.redhat.com/articles/3405381[Red Hat Process Automation Manager 7 Supported Configurations].

The build procedure creates a custom extension image that extends the existing {KIE_SERVER} image. You must import this custom extension image into your OpenShift environment and then reference it in the `EXTENSION_IMAGE` parameter.

.Prerequisites
* You are logged in to your OpenShift environment using the `oc` command. Your OpenShift user must have the `registry-editor` role.
* For Oracle Database, IBM DB2, or Sybase, you downloaded the JDBC driver from the database server vendor.
* You have installed the following required software:
** Docker: For installation instructions, see https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/[Get Docker].
** Cekit version 3.2: For installation instructions, see https://docs.cekit.io/en/3.2.0/handbook/installation/index.html[Installation].
** The following libraries and extensions for Cekit. For more information, see https://docs.cekit.io/en/3.2.0/handbook/installation/dependencies.html[Dependencies].
//*** `odcs-client`, provided by the `python3-odcs-client` package or similar package
*** `docker`, provided by the `python3-docker` package or similar package
*** `docker-squash`, provided by the `python3-docker-squash` package or similar package
*** `behave`, provided by the `python3-behave` package or similar package
//*** `s2i`, provided by the `source-to-image` package or similar package. For more information, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_software_collections/3/html/using_red_hat_software_collections_container_images/sti[Chapter 2. Using Source-to-Image (S2I)].

.Procedure
. For IBM DB2, Oracle Database, or Sybase, provide the JDBC driver JAR file in a local directory.
. Download the `{PRODUCT_FILE}-openshift-templates.zip` product deliverable file from the {PRODUCT_DOWNLOAD_LINK}[Software Downloads] page of the Red Hat Customer Portal.
. Unzip the file and, using the command line, change to the `templates/contrib/jdbc/cekit` directory of the unzipped file. This directory contains the source code for the custom build.
. Enter one of the following commands, depending on the database server type:
+
** For Microsoft SQL Server:
+
[subs="attributes,verbatim,macros"]
----
make mssql
----
+
** For MySQL:
+
[subs="attributes,verbatim,macros"]
----
make mysql
----
+
** For PostgreSQL:
+
[subs="attributes,verbatim,macros"]
----
make postgresql
----
+
** For MariaDB:
+
[subs="attributes,verbatim,macros"]
----
make mariadb
----
+
** For IBM DB2:
+
[subs="attributes,verbatim,macros"]
----
make db2 artifact=/tmp/db2jcc4.jar version=10.2
----
+
In this command, replace `/tmp/db2jcc4.jar` with the path name of the downloaded Oracle Database driver and `10.2` with the version of the driver.
+
** For Oracle Database:
+
[subs="attributes,verbatim,macros"]
----
make oracle artifact=/tmp/ojdbc7.jar version=7.0
----
+
In this command, replace `/tmp/ojdbc7.jar` with the path name of the downloaded Oracle Database driver and `7.0` with the version of the driver.
+
** For Sybase:
+
[subs="attributes,verbatim,macros"]
----
make build sybase artifact=/tmp/jconn4-16.0_PL05.jar version=16.0_PL05
----
+
In this command, replace `/tmp/jconn4-16.0_PL05.jar` with the path name of the downloaded Sybase driver and `16.0_PL05` with the version of the driver.
+
Alternatively, if you need to update the driver class or driver XA class for the Sybase driver, you can set the `DRIVER_CLASS` or `DRIVER_XA_CLASS` variable for this command, for example:
+
[subs="attributes,verbatim,macros"]
----
export DRIVER_CLASS=another.class.Sybase && make sybase artifact=/tmp/jconn4-16.0_PL05.jar version=16.0_PL05
----
+
. Enter the following command to list the Docker images that are available locally:
+
[subs="attributes,verbatim,macros"]
----
docker images
----
+
Note the name of the image that was built, for example, `jboss-kie-db2-extension-openshift-image`, and the version tag of the image, for example, `11.1.4.4` (not the `latest` tag).
+
. Access the registry of your OpenShift environment directly and push the image to the registry. Depending on your user permissions, you can push the image into the `openshift` namespace or into a project namespace. For instructions about accessing the registry and pushing the images, see
ifeval::["{context}"=="openshift-operator"]
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.6/html/registry/accessing-the-registry#registry-accessing-directly_accessing-the-registry[Accessing registry directly from the cluster]

in the {OPENSHIFT} product documentation.
ifeval::["{context}"!="openshift-operator"]
. When configuring your {KIE_SERVER} deployment with a template that supports an external database server, set the following parameters:
** *Drivers Extension Image* (`EXTENSIONS_IMAGE`): The ImageStreamTag definition of the extension image, for example, `jboss-kie-db2-extension-openshift-image:11.1.4.4`
** *Drivers ImageStream Namespace* (`EXTENSIONS_IMAGE_NAMESPACE`): The namespace to which you uploaded the extension image, for example, `openshift` or your project namespace.
endif::[]
