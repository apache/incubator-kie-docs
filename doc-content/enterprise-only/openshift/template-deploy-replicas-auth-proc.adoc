= Configuring {CENTRAL} and {KIE_SERVER} replicas for a high-availability authoring environment

If you are deploying a high-availability authoring environment, by default two replicas of {CENTRAL} and two replicas of {KIE_SERVER} are initially created.

Optionally, you can modify the number of replicas.

Skip this procedure for a single authoring environment.

.Prerequisites

* You started the configuration of the template, as described in {startlink}.

.Procedure

To modify the numbers of initial replicas, set the following parameters:

* *{CENTRAL} Container Replicas* (`{CENTRAL_CAPITAL_UNDER}_CONTAINER_REPLICAS`): The number of replicas that the deployment initially creates for {CENTRAL}.
* *KIE Server Container Replicas* (`KIE_SERVER_CONTAINER_REPLICAS`): The number of replicas that the deployment initially creates for {KIE_SERVER}.

.Next steps

If necessary, set additional parameters.

To complete the deployment, follow the procedure in <<template-deploy-complete-{subcontext}-proc>>.
