** *{CENTRAL} Server Keystore Secret Name* (`{CENTRAL_CAPITAL_UNDER}_HTTPS_SECRET`): The name of the secret for {CENTRAL}, as created in <<secrets-central-create-proc>>.
** *KIE Server Keystore Secret Name* (`KIE_SERVER_HTTPS_SECRET`): The name of the secret for {KIE_SERVER}, as created in <<secrets-kie-create-proc>>.
** *Application Name* (`APPLICATION_NAME`): The name of the OpenShift application. It is used in the default URLs for {CENTRAL} and {KIE_SERVER}. OpenShift uses the application name to create a separate set of deployment configurations, services, routes, labels, and artifacts. You can deploy several applications using the same template into the same project, as long as you use different application names. Also, the application name determines the name of the server configuration (server template) on the {CENTRAL} that the {KIE_SERVER} is to join.
** *{CENTRAL} Server Certificate Name* (`{CENTRAL_CAPITAL_UNDER}_HTTPS_NAME`): The name of the certificate in the keystore that you created in <<secrets-central-create-proc>>.
** *{CENTRAL} Server Keystore Password* (`{CENTRAL_CAPITAL_UNDER}_HTTPS_PASSWORD`): The password for the keystore that you created in <<secrets-central-create-proc>>.
** *KIE Server Certificate Name* (`KIE_SERVER_HTTPS_NAME`): The name of the certificate in the keystore that you created in <<secrets-kie-create-proc>>.
** *KIE Server Keystore Password* (`KIE_SERVER_HTTPS_PASSWORD`): The password for the keystore that you created in <<secrets-kie-create-proc>>.
** *ImageStream Namespace* (`IMAGE_STREAM_NAMESPACE`): The namespace where the image streams are available. If the image streams were already available in your OpenShift environment (see <<imagestreams-file-install-proc>>), the namespace is `openshift`. If you have installed the image streams file, the namespace is the name of the OpenShift project.

You can also set the following user names and passwords:
** *KIE Admin User* (`KIE_ADMIN_USER`) and *KIE Admin Password* (`KIE_ADMIN_PWD`): The user name and password for the administrative user in {CENTRAL}.
** *KIE Server User* (`KIE_SERVER_USER`) and *KIE Server Password* (`KIE_SERVER_PWD`): The user name and password that a client application must use to connect to the {KIE_SERVER}.

. If you want to deploy additional {KIE_SERVERS} and connect them to this {CENTRAL}, set the following parameters:
** *KIE Server Controller User* (`KIE_SERVER_CONTROLLER_USER`) and *KIE Server Controller Password* (`KIE_SERVER_CONTROLLER_PWD`): The user name and password that a {KIE_SERVER} must use to connect to the {CENTRAL}.

Alternatively, if you want to use the Maven repository that is built into {CENTRAL} and to connect additional {KIE_SERVERS} to the {CENTRAL}, set the following parameters:
** *Username for the Maven service hosted by {CENTRAL}* (`{CENTRAL_CAPITAL_UNDER}_MAVEN_USERNAME`): The user name for the built-in Maven repository.
** *Password for the Maven service hosted by {CENTRAL}* (`{CENTRAL_CAPITAL_UNDER}_MAVEN_PASSWORD`): The password for the built-in Maven repository.
