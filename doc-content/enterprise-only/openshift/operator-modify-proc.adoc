= Modifying an environment that is deployed using operators

If an environment is deployed using operators, you cannot modify it using typical OpenShift methods. For example, if you delete a deployment configuration or a service, it is re-created automatically with the same parameters.

To modify the environment, you must modify the YAML description of the environment. You can change common settings such as passwords, add new {KIE_SERVERS}, and scale {KIE_SERVERS}.

.Procedure
. Enter your project in the OpenShift web cluster console. 
. In the OpenShift Web console navigation panel, select *Catalog -> Installed operators* or *Operators -> Installed operators*.
. Find the `Business Automation` operator line in the table and click `KieApp` in the line. Information about the environments that you deployed using this operator is displayed.
. Click the name of a deployed environment. 
. Select the *YAML* tab. 
+
A YAML source is displayed. In this YAML source, you can edit the content under `spec:` to change the configuration of the environment.
+
. If you want to change the deployed version of {PRODUCT}, add the following line under `spec:`
+
[subs="attributes,verbatim,macros,quotes"]
----
  version: {ENTERPRISE_VERSION_LONG}
----
+ 
You can replace `{ENTERPRISE_VERSION_LONG}` with another required version. Use this setting to upgrade {PRODUCT} to a new version if automatic updates are disabled, for example, if you use a custom image.
+
. If you want to change common settings, such as passwords, edit the values under `commonConfig:`.
. If you want to add new {KIE_SERVERS}, add their descriptions at the end of the block under `servers:`, as shown in the following examples:
+ 
** To add two servers named `server-a` and `server-a-2`, add the following lines:
+
[subs="attributes,verbatim,macros"]
----
- deployments: 2
  name: server-a
----
+ 
** To add an immutable {KIE_SERVER} that includes services built from source in an S2I process, add the following lines:
+
[subs="attributes,verbatim,macros"]
----
- build:
    kieServerContainerDeployment: <deployment>
    gitSource:
      uri: <url>
      reference: <branch>
      contextDir: <directory>
----
+
Replace the following values:
+
*** `<deployment>`: The identifying information of the decision service (KJAR file) that is built from your source. The format is `<containerId>=<groupId>:<artifactId>:<version>`. You can provide two or more KJAR files using the `|` separator, for example `containerId=groupId:artifactId:version|c2=g2:a2:v2`. The Maven build process must produce all these files from the source in the Git repository.
*** `<url>`: The URL for the Git repository that contains the source for your decision service.
*** `<branch>`: The branch in the Git repository.
*** `<directory>`: The path to the source within the project downloaded from the Git repository.
+
. If you want to scale a {KIE_SERVER}, find the description of the server in the block under `servers:` and add a `replicas:` setting under that description. For example, `replicas: 3` scales the server to three pods.
. If you want to make other changes, review the CRD source for the available settings. To view the CRD source, log in to the {OPENSHIFT} environment with the `oc` command as an administrative user and then enter the following command:
+
----
oc get crd kieapps.app.kiegroup.org -oyaml
----
+ 
. Click *Save* and then wait for a `has been updated` pop-up message.
. Click *Reload* to view the new YAML description of the environment.
