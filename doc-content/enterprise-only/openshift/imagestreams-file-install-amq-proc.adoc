= Ensuring the availability of AMQ scaledown controller image streams for a high-availability deployment

If you want to deploy a {PRODUCT} high-availability authoring environment, you must ensure that image streams for AMQ scaledown controller are available.

[IMPORTANT]
====
In {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}, high-availability {CENTRAL} functionality is for Technology Preview only. For more information on Red Hat Technology Preview features, see https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/[Technology Preview Features Scope].
====

.Prerequisites
* You ensured the availability of image streams and the image registry for {PRODUCT} according to the instructions in <<imagestreams-file-install-proc>>.

.Procedure

To ensure that image streams for AMQ scaledown controller are available, complete the following additional steps:

. Verify if the AMQ scaledown controller image stream is present. Enter the following command:
+
[subs="attributes,verbatim,macros"]
----
$ oc get imagestreamtag -n openshift | grep amq-broker-72-scaledown-controller-openshift
----
+
If the output of the command is not empty, the required image stream is available in the `openshift` namespace and no further action is required.
+
. If the output of the commands is empty, complete the following steps:
.. Download the  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jboss-container-images/jboss-amq-7-broker-openshift-image/amq-broker-72/amq-broker-7-scaledown-controller-image-streams.yaml[amq-broker-7-scaledown-controller-image-streams.yaml] file.
.. Complete one of the following actions:
+
*** Enter the following command:
+
[subs="attributes,verbatim,macros"]
----
$ oc create -f amq-broker-7-scaledown-controller-image-streams.yaml
----
+
*** In the OpenShift Web UI, select *Add to Project -> Import YAML / JSON* and then choose the `amq-broker-7-scaledown-controller-image-streams.yaml` file or paste its contents.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you complete these steps, you install the image streams into the namespace of your project. In this case, when you deploy the templates, you must set the `AMQ_SCALEDOWN_CONTROLLER_IMAGE_STREAM_NAMESPACE` parameter to the name of this project.
