= Enabling the `OpenShiftStartupStrategy` setting to connect additional {KIE_SERVERS} to {CENTRAL}

In an environment deployed using {PRODUCT} authoring templates, {CENTRAL} manages one {KIE_SERVER}.

If you use the high-avalability authoring template or if you modified the single authoring template to use a database server other than an embedded H2 database, you

ifdef::DM[]
You

can scale the {KIE_SERVER} pod, but all the copies execute the same services.

If you want to connect additional {KIE_SERVERS} to {CENTRAL}, you must enable the `OpenShiftStartupStrategy` setting in the environment. With this setting, {CENTRAL} automatically discovers {KIE_SERVERS} in the same namespace and these {KIE_SERVERS} can be configured to connect to the {CENTRAL}.

If you enable the `OpenShiftStartupStrategy` setting, an additional limitation applies to your environment. If a user is deploying a service to the {KIE_SERVER}, no user is able to deploy another service to the same {KIE_SERVER} until the first deployment completes. Because of this limitation, the `OpenShiftStartupStrategy` setting might not be suitable for some authoring environments. 

Do not complete this procedure unless you want to connect additional {KIE_SERVERS} to {CENTRAL}.

.Prerequisites

* You deployed an authoring environment using the `{PRODUCT_INIT}{ENTERPRISE_VERSION_SHORT}-authoring.yaml` or `{PRODUCT_INIT}{ENTERPRISE_VERSION_SHORT}-authoring-ha.yaml` template.
* You are logged in to the OpenShift project where the environment is deployed using the `oc` tool.

.Procedure

. Enter the following command to view the deployment configurations that are deployed in the project:
+
[subs="attributes,verbatim,macros"]
----
$ oc get dc
----
+
. In the output of the command, find the deployment configuration names for the {CENTRAL} and {KIE_SERVER} pods:
** The name of the deployment configuration for {CENTRAL} is `__myapp__-{PRODUCT_INIT}centr`. Replace `__myapp__` with the application name of the environment, which is set in the `APPLICATION_NAME` parameter of the template.
** The name of the deployment configuration for {KIE_SERVER} is `__myapp__-kieserver`. Replace `__myapp__` with the application name.
+
. Enter the following commands to enable the `OpenShiftStartupStrategy` setting on the pods:
+
[subs="attributes,verbatim,macros,quotes"]
----
$ oc env __myapp__-{PRODUCT_INIT}centr KIE_SERVER_CONTROLLER_OPENSHIFT_ENABLED=true
$ oc env __myapp__-kieserver KIE_SERVER_STARTUP_STRATEGY=OpenShiftStartupStrategy
----
+
In these commands, replace `__myapp__-{PRODUCT_INIT}centr` with the {CENTRAL} deployment configuration name and `__myapp__-kieserver` with the {KIE_SERVER} deployment configuration name.
. When you enable the `OpenShiftStartupStrategy` setting, by default {CENTRAL} discovers only {KIE_SERVERS} that are deployed with the same value of the `APPLICATION_NAME` parameter as the authoring template. If you want to connect {KIE_SERVERS} with any other application names to the {CENTRAL}, enter the following command:
+
[subs="attributes,verbatim,macros,quotes"]
----
$ oc env __myapp__-{PRODUCT_INIT}centr KIE_SERVER_CONTROLLER_OPENSHIFT_GLOBAL_DISCOVERY_ENABLED=true
----
+
In this command, replace `__myapp__-{PRODUCT_INIT}centr` with the {CENTRAL} deployment configuration name.
