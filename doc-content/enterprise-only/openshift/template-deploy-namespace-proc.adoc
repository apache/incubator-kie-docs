= Configuring the image stream namespace for {what_deploying_brief}

If you created image streams in a namespace that is not `openshift`, you must configure the namespace in the template.

If all image streams were already available in your {OPENSHIFT} environment, you can skip this procedure.

.Prerequisites

* You started the configuration of the template, as described in {startlink}.

.Procedure

If you installed an image streams file according to instructions in <<imagestreams-file-install-proc_{context}>>, set the *ImageStream Namespace* (`IMAGE_STREAM_NAMESPACE`) parameter to the name of your OpenShift project.
