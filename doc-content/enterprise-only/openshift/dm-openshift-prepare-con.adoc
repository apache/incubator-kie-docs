= Preparation for deploying {PRODUCT} in your OpenShift environment

Before deploying {PRODUCT} in your OpenShift environment, you must complete several procedures. You do not need to repeat these procedures if you want to deploy additional images, for example, for new versions of
ifdef::DM[decision services or for other decision services]
ifdef::PAM[processes or for other processes.]

[NOTE]
====
If you are deploying a trial environment, complete the procedure described in
ifeval::["{context}"=="openshift-templates"]
xref:imagestreams-file-install-proc_{context}[] 
endif::[]
ifeval::["{context}"=="openshift-operator"]
xref:registry-authentication-proc_{context}[] 
endif::[]
and do not complete any other preparation procedures.
