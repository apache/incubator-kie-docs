= Ensuring your environment is authenticated to the Red Hat registry
// this is for operators where you don't do image streams

To deploy {PRODUCT} components of {OPENSHIFT}, you must ensure that OpenShift can download the correct images from the Red Hat registry. OpenShift must be configured to authenticate with the Red Hat registry using your service account user name and password.

.Procedure
. Determine whether {OPENSHIFT} was configured with the user name and password for Red Hat registry access. For details about the required configuration, see https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/install/configuring_inventory_file.html#advanced-install-configuring-registry-location[Configuring a Registry Location]. If you are using an OpenShift Online subscription, it is configured for Red Hat registry access.

. If {OPENSHIFT} was configured with the user name and password for Red Hat registry access, no further action is required. Otherwise, complete the following steps:
.. Ensure you are logged in to OpenShift with the `oc` command and that your project is active.
.. Complete the steps documented in https://access.redhat.com/RegistryAuthentication#registry-service-accounts-for-shared-environments-4[Registry Service Accounts for Shared Environments]. You must log in to Red Hat Customer Portal to access the document and to complete the steps to create a registry service account.
.. Select the *OpenShift Secret* tab and click the link under *Download secret* to download the YAML secret file.
.. View the downloaded file and note the name that is listed in the `name:` entry.
.. Run the following commands:
+
[subs="attributes,verbatim,macros"]
----
oc create -f <file_name>.yaml
oc secrets link default <secret_name> --for=pull
oc secrets link builder <secret_name> --for=pull
----
+
Replace `<file_name>` with the name of the downloaded file and `<secret_name>` with the name that is listed in the `name:` entry of the file.
