= Freeform managed server environment

You can deploy a freeform server environment that includes several different pods running {KIE_SERVER}. These {KIE_SERVERS} can run different services for staging or production purposes. You can add and remove servers as necessary at any time.

You start deploying a freeform managed server environment by deploying {CENTRAL} Monitoring and one managed {KIE_SERVER}. You can use {CENTRAL} Monitoring to monitor and, when necessary, manage the execution of services on {KIE_SERVERS}. This environment does not include Smart Router.

You can also deploy additional managed {KIE_SERVERS}. Each {KIE_SERVER} can be separately scaled as necessary.

On a managed {KIE_SERVER}, no services are initially loaded. Use {CENTRAL} Monitoring or the REST API of the {KIE_SERVER} to deploy and undeploy processes on the server.

You must provide a Maven repository with the processes (KJAR files) that you want to deploy on the servers. Your integration process must ensure that the required versions of the processes are uploaded to the Maven repository. You can use {CENTRAL} in a development environment to create the processes and upload them to the Maven repository.

Each {KIE_SERVER} uses a database server. Usually, the database servers also run in pods, although you can set up a {KIE_SERVER} to use an external database server.

You can also deploy immutable {KIE_SERVERS} in the same namespace. You can use {CENTRAL} Monitoring to view monitoring information for all {KIE_SERVERS} in the environment, including immutable servers. For instructions about deploying immutable {KIE_SERVERS}, see {URL_DEPLOYING_ON_OPENSHIFT}#assembly-openshift-immutable[_{DEPLOYING_IMMUTABLE_ON_OPENSHIFT}_].
