. Search for *Business Automation*, select it and click *Install*.
. On the *Create Operator Subscription* page, select your target namespace and approval strategy.

Set *Approval strategy* to `Automatic` to enable automatic operator updates. An operator update does not immediately update the product, but is required before you update the product. Configure automatic or manual product updates using the settings in every particular product deployment.
