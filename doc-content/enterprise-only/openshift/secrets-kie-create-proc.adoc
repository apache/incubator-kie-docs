OpenShift uses objects called _secrets_ to hold sensitive information such as passwords or keystores. For more information about OpenShift secrets, see the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/3.11/html/developer_guide/dev-guide-secrets[Secrets chapter] in the OpenShift documentation.

You must create an SSL certificate for {KIE_SERVER} and provide it to your OpenShift environment as a secret.

ifdef::CAN_AUTOCREATE[]
{KIE_SERVER} uses an SSL certificate to provide HTTPS access. The deployment can create a sample secret automatically. However, in production environments you must create an SSL certificate for {KIE_SERVER} and provide it to your OpenShift environment as a secret.

NOTE: You do not need to create the secrets object if you are planning to deploy only {KIE_SERVERS} without support for HTTPS.

.Procedure
. Generate an SSL keystore with a private and public key for SSL encryption for {KIE_SERVER}. In a production environment, generate a valid signed certificate that matches the expected URL of the {KIE_SERVER}. Save the keystore in a file named `keystore.jks`. Record the name of the certificate and the password of the keystore file. 
+
For more information on how to create a keystore with self-signed or purchased SSL certificates, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/JBoss_Enterprise_Application_Platform/6.1/html-single/Security_Guide/index.html#Generate_a_SSL_Encryption_Key_and_Certificate[Generate a SSL Encryption Key and Certificate].
+
. Use the `oc` command to generate a secret named `kieserver-app-secret` from the new keystore file:

$ oc create secret generic kieserver-app-secret --from-file=keystore.jks
