= Creating a custom {KIE_SERVER} image with an additional RPM package

You can create a custom {KIE_SERVER} image where an additional RPM package is installed. You can push this image into your custom registry and then use it to deploy the {KIE_SERVER}.

You can install any package from the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 repository. This example installs the `procps-ng` package, which provides the `ps` utility, but you can modify it to install other packages. 

.Procedure

include::customimage-download-step.adoc[]
. Create a `Dockerfile` that defines a custom image based on the base image. The file must change the current user to `root`, install the RPM package using the `yum` command, and then revert to `USER 185`, the {EAP} user. The following example shows the content of the `Dockerfile` file:
+
[subs="attributes,verbatim,macros,quotes"]
----
FROM registry.redhat.io/{PRODUCT_INIT}-7/{PRODUCT_INIT}-kieserver-rhel8:{ENTERPRISE_VERSION_LONG}
USER root
RUN yum -y install procps-ng
USER 185
----
+
Replace the name of the RPM file as necessary. The `yum` command automatically installs all dependencies from the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 repository. You might need to install several RPM files, in this case, use several `RUN` commands.

In the shell prompt for the image, enter the command to test that the RPM is installed, then enter `exit`. For example, for `procps-ng`, run the `ps` command:
+
[subs="attributes,verbatim,macros,quotes"]
----
[jboss@c2fab36b778e ~]$ ps
PID TTY          TIME CMD
  1 pts/0    00:00:00 bash
 13 pts/0    00:00:00 ps
[jboss@c2fab36b778e ~]$ exit
