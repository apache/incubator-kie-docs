= Setting parameters for LDAP authentication for {what_deploying_brief}

If you want to use LDAP authentication, complete the following additional configuration when configuring the template to deploy {what_deploying}.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not configure LDAP authentication and RH-SSO authentication in the same deployment.
====

.Prerequisites

* You created user names and passwords for {PRODUCT} in the LDAP system. For a list of the available roles, see <<roles-users-con_{context}>>.
+
You must create a user with the username and password configured in the secret for the administrative user, as described in <<secret-adminuser-create-proc_{context}>>. This user must have the `kie-server,rest-all,admin` roles.
* You started the configuration of the template, as described in {startlink}.

.Procedure
. Set the `AUTH_LDAP*` parameters of the template. These parameters configure LDAP authentication using the Elytron subsystem of {EAP}. For more information about using the Elytron subsystem of {EAP} with LDAP, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_enterprise_application_platform/{EAP_VERSION}/html/how_to_configure_identity_management/elytron_secure_apps#elytron_ldap_auth_app[Configure Authentication with an LDAP-Based Identity Store].
+
[NOTE]
====
If you want to enable LDAP failover, you can put set or more LDAP server addresses in the `AUTH_LDAP_URL` parameter, separated by a space.
====
+
If the LDAP server does not define all the roles required for your deployment, you can map LDAP groups to {PRODUCT} roles. To enable LDAP role mapping, set the following parameters:
+
** *RoleMapping rolesProperties file path or one lined roles* (`AUTH_ROLE_MAPPER_ROLES_PROPERTIES`): The fully qualified path name of a file that defines role mapping, for example `/opt/eap/standalone/configuration/rolemapping/rolemapping.properties`. You must provide this file and mount it at this path in all applicable deployment configurations; for instructions, see <<rolemapping-proc_{context}>>.
+
Alternatively, you can enter role mapping settings directly in this property, using the `role=role1,role2;another-role=role2` pattern, for example `admins=kie-server,rest-all,admin;developers=kie-server,rest-all`.
** *Role Mapper Keep Mapped* (`AUTH_LDAP_MAPPER_KEEP_MAPPED`): If set to `true`, both mapped roles and roles defined on the LDAP server are set as user application roles; if set to `false`, mapped roles replace the roles defined on the LDAP server. The default setting is `false`.
** *Role Mapper Keep Non-mapped* (`AUTH_LDAP_MAPPER_KEEP_NON_MAPPED`): If set to `true`, roles defined on the LDAP server and not corresponding to any mapping are kept as user application roles; if set to `false`, roles that have no mapping are removed. The default setting is `false`.

.Next steps

If necessary, set additional parameters.

To complete the deployment, follow the procedure in <<template-deploy-complete-{subcontext}-proc>>.
