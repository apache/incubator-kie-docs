= Customizing Dashbuilder Standalone

When you use the Dashbuilder Container Image within operator, you can configure Dashbuilder by using the environment variables or through Custom Resource.

You can use operator to set environment variables by using the `env` property. The following example sets the value of the `DASHBUILDER_UPLOAD_SIZE` property to `1000`.
