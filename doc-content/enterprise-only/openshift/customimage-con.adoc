and Smart Router

deployments. You must push the images to your own container registry. When deploying {PRODUCT}, you can configure the operator to use the custom images.

If you use a custom image, you must disable automatic version updates. When you want to install a new version, build the image with the same name as before and the new version tag and push the image into your registry. You can then change the version and the operator automatically pulls the new image. For instructions about changing the product version in the operator, see xref:operator-modify-proc_{context}[].

In particular, you can create the following types of custom images:

* A custom image of {KIE_SERVER} that includes an additional RPM package
* A custom image of {KIE_SERVER} that includes an additional JAR class library
ifdef::PAM[]
* A custom image of Smart Router that includes an additional JAR class library to implement custom routing
