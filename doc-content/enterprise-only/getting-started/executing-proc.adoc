= Executing the *MortgageApprovalProcess* process application
Now that you have deployed the project, you can execute the project's defined functionality. For this tutorial you input data into a mortgage application form acting as the mortgage broker. The *MortgageApprovalProcess* business process runs and determines whether or not the applicant has offered an acceptable down payment based on the decision rules that you defined earlier. The business process either ends the rule testing or requests that the applicant increase the down payment to proceed. If the application passes the business rule testing, the bank's approver reviews the application and either approve or deny the loan.
