= Creating users
You can create as many {CENTRAL} users as you require. User privileges and settings are controlled by the roles assigned to a user and the groups that a user belongs to. For this example, you must create two new users: `Katy` who will act as the bank's loan manager and approver, and `Bill` who will act as the broker requesting the loan. For more information on creating users, see the *Creating users* chapter of {URL_INSTALLING_AND_CONFIGURING}#assembly-install-on-eap[_{INSTALLING_ON_EAP}_].

In {CENTRAL}, you can use groups and roles to control permissions for a collection of users. You can create as many groups and roles as you want but a group must have at least one user.

* For this example, the user or users working on the tasks must be assigned to one or more of the following groups and roles:
** *approver* group: For the *Qualify* task
** *broker* group: For the *Correct Data* and *Increase Down Payment* tasks
** *manager* role: For the *Final Approval* task
