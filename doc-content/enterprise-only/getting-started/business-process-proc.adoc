= Creating the business process
The following procedures guide you through the creation of tasks, connections, and gateways that make up the *MortgageApprovalProcess* business process. The mortgage validation business process determines whether a mortgage application contains all required data. If the specified data requirements are met, the application proceeds on to the mortgage calculation business process.

.Procedure
. In {CENTRAL}, go to *Menu* -> *Design* -> *Projects* -> *mortgage-process*.
. Click *Add Asset* -> *Business Process*.
. Enter the following values:
+
* *Business Process*: `MortgageApprovalProcess`
* *Package*: Select `com.myspace.mortgage_process`
+
The *Package* specifies the location inside the existing project where the asset will be created. In this example, it is created in `com/myspace/mortgage_process`.

. Click *Ok*. The diagram editor opens.
. In the upper-right corner, click the *Diagram properties* image:getting-started/diagram_properties.png[] icon.
. Scroll down and expand *Process Data* and click image:getting-started/btn_plus.png[] in the *Process Variables* section.
. Enter the following values:
+
* *Name*: `application`
* *Data Type*: `Application [com.myspace.mortgage_process]`

== Creating outgoing connections and exclusive gateways
This section shows you how to create outgoing connections, exclusive gateways, and business rule tasks. Use exclusive gateways to make decisions and react to events based on the available data.

{PRODUCT} contains a predefined selection of node types to simplify business process creation. The predefined node panel is located on the left side of the diagram editor.
