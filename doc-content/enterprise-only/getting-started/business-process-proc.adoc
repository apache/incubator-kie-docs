= Creating a new *MortgageApprovalProcess* business process application

The following procedures guide you through the creation of each task, connection, and gateway that comprises the *MortgageApprovalProcess* business process.

{PRODUCT} contains a predefined selection of node types to simplify business process creation. The predefined node panel is located on the left side of the diagram editor.

== Validating the mortgage
The mortgage validation business process determines whether the new application contains the required data before proceeding. If all of the specified data requirements are met, the application moves on to the mortgage calculation business process.

.Procedure
. In {CENTRAL}, go to *Menu* -> *Design* -> *Projects* -> *Mortgage_Process*.
. Click *Add Asset* -> *Business Process*.
. Enter the following values:
+
* *Business Process*: `MortgageApprovalProcess`
* *Package*: Select `com.myspace.mortgage_app`
+
The *Package* specifies the location inside the existing project where the asset will be created. In this example, it is created in `com/myspace/mortgage_app`.

. Click *Ok*. The diagram editor opens.
. In the upper-right corner, click the *Diagram properties* image:getting-started/diagram_properties.png[] icon.
. Scroll down and expand *Process Data* and click image:getting-started/btn_plus.png[] in the *Process Variables* section.
. Enter the following values:
+
* *Name*: `application`.

== Creating outgoing connections and exclusive gateways
Create an outgoing connection to an exclusive gateway. Exclusive gateways are used to make decisions and react to events based on the available data.

.Procedure
. Click on the start event and create an outgoing connection from the start event to an exclusive gateway.
