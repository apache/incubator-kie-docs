= Creating the *MortgageApprovalProcess* business process

A business process is a graph that describes the order in which a series of steps must be executed using a flow chart. A business process consists of a collection of nodes that are linked to each other using connections. Each of the nodes represents one step in the overall process while the connections specify how to transition from one node to the other.

The *Mortgage Process* sample project contains a predefined *MortgageApprovalProcess* business process. For this tutorial, you will delete the existing *MortgageApprovalProcess* business process and recreate it to gain a better understanding of creating a business process.

.Procedure

== Delete the existing business process
You must delete the sample business process before you can create your own.

.Procedure
. Log in to {CENTRAL} and click *Menu* -> *Design* -> *Projects*, then click *Mortgage Process*.
. Input `MortgageApprovalProcess.bpmn` in to the project's asset search box and click on the *MortgageApprovalProcess* business process.
. Click *Delete* in the upper-right corner, then click *Delete* to confirm that you want to delete this asset.

=== Validating the mortgage
The mortgage validation business process determines whether or not the new application contains the required data before proceeding. If all of the specified data requirements are met, the application will move on to the mortgage calculation business process.

.Procedure
. Log in to {CENTRAL} and click *Menu* -> *Design* -> *Projects*, then click *Mortgage Process*.
. Click *Add Asset* -> *Business Process*.
. Enter the following values:
+
* *Business Process*: `MortgageApprovalProcess`
* *Package*: Select `com.myspace.mortgage_app`

. Click *Ok*. The diagram editor opens.
. In the upper-right corner, click the *Diagram properties* image:getting-started/diagram_properties.png[] icon.
. Scroll down and expand *Process Data* and click image:getting-started/btn_plus.png[] in the *Process Variables* section.
. Enter the following values:
+
* *Name*: `application`.
* *Data Type*: `Application [com.myspace.mortgage_app]`

. Click *Save*, then *Save*, to confirm your changes.

=== Creating outgoing connections
This section describes how to create an outgoing connection from the start event to an exclusive gateway and then from the exclusive gateway to the business rule task. Exclusive gateways are used to make decisions and react to events based on the available data. A business rule task represents a set of rules that must be evaluated.

{PRODUCT} contains a predefined selection of node types to simplify business process creation. The predefined node panel is located on the left side of the diagram editor. Click on the various node icons to reveal the available options as shown here.

.Procedure
. Click on the start event and create an outgoing connection from the start event to an exclusive gateway.
