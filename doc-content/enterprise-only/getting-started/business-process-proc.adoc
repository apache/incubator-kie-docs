== Creating the initial mortgage business process
The mortgage validation business process determines whether a mortgage application contains all required data. If the specified data requirements are met, the application proceeds on to the mortgage calculation business process.

.Procedure
. In {CENTRAL}, go to *Menu* -> *Design* -> *Projects* -> *Mortgage_Process*.
. Click *Add Asset* -> *Business Process*.
. Enter the following values:
+
* *Business Process*: `MortgageApprovalProcess`
* *Package*: Select `com.myspace.mortgage_app`
+
The *Package* specifies the location inside the existing project where the asset will be created. In this example, it is created in `com/myspace/mortgage_app`.

. Click *Ok*. The diagram editor opens.
. In the upper-right corner, click the *Diagram properties* image:getting-started/diagram_properties.png[] icon.
. Scroll down and expand *Process Data* and click image:getting-started/btn_plus.png[] in the *Process Variables* section.
. Enter the following values:
+
* *Name*: `application`
* *Data Type*: `Application [com.myspace.mortgage_app]`
