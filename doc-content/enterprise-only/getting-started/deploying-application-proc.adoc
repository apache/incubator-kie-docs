= Deploying the *MortgageApprovalProcess* process application

The following chapter instructs you how to build and deploy a new instance of the *Mortgage_Process* application in {PRODUCT}.

.Prerequisites
The {KIE_SERVER} is deployed and connected to the {CENTRAL}.

.Procedure
. Log in to {CENTRAL} and click *Menu* -> *Design* -> *Projects* -> *Mortgage_Process*.
. Click *Deploy*.
+
* If no KIE container (deployment unit) is included with the project name, a container with default values is automatically created.
* If an older version of the project is already deployed, go to the project settings and change the project version. When finished, save the change and click *Deploy*. This deploys a new version of the same project with the latest changes in place, alongside the older version(s).
+
[NOTE]
====
For development purposes, you can select the *Build and Install* option to compile the project and publish the KJAR file to the configured Maven repository without deploying to a {KIE_SERVER}. This option is equivalent to running `mvn clean install` for your project in the command terminal. You can also click *Deploy* to deploy the compiled KJAR file to a {KIE_SERVER} without aborting any running instances (if applicable), or click *Redeploy* to deploy the compiled KJAR file and abort any running instances.

To enable development mode in {CENTRAL}, go to project *Settings* -> *General Settings* -> *Version* and toggle the *Development Mode* option. Do not use *Development Mode* or manually add the `SNAPSHOT` version suffix for a production environment.
====

. To verify the deployment, click *Menu* -> *Manage* -> *Process Definitions*, and click image:getting-started/btn_refresh.png[].
. Click on the three vertical dots in the *Actions* column and select *Start* to start a new instance of the process.
