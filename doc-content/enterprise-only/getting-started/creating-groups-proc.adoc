= Creating users and assigning them to groups
In {CENTRAL}, you can use groups to control permissions for a collection of users. You can create as many groups as you want but a group must have at least one user. For this example, you must create the following groups:

* *Approver*: For the *Qualify* business process task
* *Broker*: For the *Correct Data* and *Increase Down Payment* business process tasks
* *Manager*: For the *Final Approval* business process task
