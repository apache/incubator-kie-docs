= Viewing the Pricing loans decision table
The goal of this chapter is to introduce you to the *Pricing loans* decision table. For this tutorial, you will not create and set the decision table conditions. Instead, review the values and the conditions that are already defined in the *{PROJECT}* sample project's *Pricing loans* Guided Decision Tables asset. For information about creating decision tables, see {URL_GUIDED_DECISION_TABLES}[_{GUIDED_DECISION_TABLES}_].
