= Viewing the mortgage decision table
The goal of this chapter is to introduce you to the *MortgageDecisionTable* decision table. For this tutorial, you do not create and set the decision table conditions. Instead, review the values and the conditions that are already defined in the *Mortgage_Process* sample project's *MortgageDecisionTable* Guided Decision Tables asset. For information about creating decision tables, see {URL_DEVELOPING_DECISION_SERVICES}#assembly-guided-decision-tables[_{GUIDED_DECISION_TABLES}_].
