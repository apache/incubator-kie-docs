= Overview of the source code of the employee rostering starter application

The employee rostering starter application consists of the following principal components:

* A `backend` that implements the rostering logic using {PLANNER} and provides a REST API
* A `frontend` module that implements a user interface using React and interacts with the `backend` module through the REST API.

You can build and use these components independently. In particular, you can implement a different user interface and use the REST API to call the server.

In addition to the two main components, the employee rostering template contains a generator of random source data (useful for demonstration and testing purposes) and a benchmarking application.

.Modules and key classes
The Java source code of the employee rostering template contains several Maven modules. Each of these modules includes a separate Maven project file (`pom.xml`), but they are intended for building in a common project.

The modules contain a number of files, including Java classes. This document lists all the modules, as well as the classes and other files that contain the key information for the employee rostering calculations.

* `employee-rostering-benchmark` module: Contains an additional application that generates random data and benchmarks the solution.

* `employee-rostering-distribution` module: Contains README files.

* `employee-rostering-docs` module: Contains documentation files.

* `employee-rostering-frontend` module: Contains the client application with the user interface, developed in React.

* `employee-rostering-backend` module: Contains the server application that uses {PLANNER} to perform the rostering calculation.
** `src/main/resources/org/optaweb/employeerostering/server/solver/employeeRosteringScoreRules.drl` file: Contains the rules for the {PLANNER} calculation. These rules are written in the Drools rules language. You can modify the rules to change the logic for employee rostering.
** `src/main/java/org.optaweb.employeerostering.server.roster/rosterGenerator.java` class: generates random input data for demonstration and testing purposes. If you change the requires input data, change the generator accordingly.
** `employee/EmployeeAvailability.java` defines availability information for an employee. For every time slot, an employee can be unavailable, available, or it can be a preferred timeslot for the employee.
** `employee/Employee.java` defines an employee. An employee has a name, a list of skills, and works under a contract. Skills are represented by `EmployeeSkillProficiency` objects.
** `roster/Roster.java` defines the calculated rostering information.
** `shift/Shift.java` defines a shift to which an employee can be assigned. A shift is defined by a time slot and a spot. For example, in a diner there could be a shift in the `Kitchen` spot for the `February 20 8AM-4PM` time slot. Multiple shifts can be defined for a given spot and time slot; in this case, multiple employees are required for this spot and time slot.
** `skill/Skill.java` defines a skill that an employee can have.
** `spot/Spot.java` defines a spot where employees can be placed. For example, in a diner `Kitchen` can be a spot.
** `contract/Contract.java` defines a contract that sets the limits of work time for an employee in various time periods.
** `tenant/Tenant.java` defines a tenant. Each tenant represents an independent set of data; any change in the data for one tenant does not affect any other tenants.
+
The `employee-rostering-shared` module also includes other shared artifacts:
** `*View.java` classes define value sets that are calculated from other information; the client application can read these values through the REST API, but not write them.
** `*RestService.java` interfaces define the REST API. Both the server and the client application separately define implementations of these interfaces.
