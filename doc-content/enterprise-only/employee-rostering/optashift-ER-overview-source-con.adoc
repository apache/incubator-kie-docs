= Overview of the source code of the employee rostering starter application

The employee rostering starter application consists of the following principal components:

* A `backend` that implements the rostering logic using {PLANNER} and provides a REST API
* A `frontend` module that implements a user interface using React and interacts with the `backend` module through the REST API

You can build and use these components independently. In particular, you can implement a different user interface and use the REST API to call the server.

In addition to the two main components, the employee rostering template contains a generator of random source data (useful for demonstration and testing purposes) and a benchmarking application.

.Modules and key classes
The Java source code of the employee rostering template contains several Maven modules. Each of these modules includes a separate Maven project file (`pom.xml`), but they are intended for building in a common project.

The modules contain a number of files, including Java classes. This document lists all the modules, as well as the classes and other files that contain the key information for the employee rostering calculations.

* `optaweb-employee-rostering-benchmark` module: Contains an additional application that generates random data and benchmarks the solution.

* `optaweb-employee-rostering-distribution` module: Contains README files.

* `optaweb-employee-rostering-docs` module: Contains documentation files.

* `optaweb-employee-rostering-frontend` module: Contains the client application with the user interface, developed in React.

* `optaweb-employee-rostering-backend` module: Contains the server application that uses {PLANNER} to perform the rostering calculation.
** `src/main/java/org.optaweb.employeerostering.service.roster/rosterGenerator.java`: Generates random input data for demonstration and testing purposes. If you change the required input data, change the generator accordingly.
** `src/main/java/org.optaweb.employeerostering.domain.employee/EmployeeAvailability.java`: Defines availability information for an employee. For every time slot an employee can be unavailable, available, or it can be designated a preferred time slot for the employee.
** `src/main/java/org.optaweb.employeerostering.domain.employee/Employee.java`: Defines an employee. An employee has a name, a list of skills, and works under a contract. Skills are represented by skill objects.
** `src/main/java/org.optaweb.employeerostering.domain.roster/Roster.java`: Defines the calculated rostering information.
** `src/main/java/org.optaweb.employeerostering.domain.shift/Shift.java`: Defines a shift to which an employee can be assigned. A shift is defined by a time slot and a spot. For example, in a diner there could be a shift in the *Kitchen* spot for the February 20 8AM-4PM time slot. Multiple shifts can be defined for a given spot and time slot. In this case, multiple employees are required for this spot and time slot.
** `src/main/java/org.optaweb.employeerostering.domain.skill/Skill.java`: Defines a skill that an employee can have.
** `src/main/java/org.optaweb.employeerostering.domain.spot/Spot.java`: Defines a spot where employees can be placed. For example,  a `Kitchen` can be a spot.
** `src/main/java/org.optaweb.employeerostering.domain.contract/Contract.java`:  Defines a contract that sets limits on work time for an employee in various time periods.
** `src/main/java/org.optaweb.employeerostering.domain.tenant/Tenant.java`: Defines a tenant. Each tenant represents an independent set of data. Changes in the data for one tenant do not affect any other tenants.
** `*View.java`: Classes related to domain objects that define value sets that are calculated from other information; the client application can read these values through the REST API, but not write them.
** `*Service.java`: Interfaces located in the service package that define the REST API. Both the server and the client application separately define implementations of these interfaces.
