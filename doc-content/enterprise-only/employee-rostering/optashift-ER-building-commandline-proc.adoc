= Building and running the employee rostering starter application from the command line
You can use the command line to build the employee rostering starter application and run it.

If you use this procedure, the data is stored in memory and is lost when the server is stopped. To build and run the application with a database server for persistent storage, see <<optashift-ER-building-commandline-db-proc>>.

.Prerequisites
* You prepared the deployment files as described in <<er-deploy-prepare-proc>>.
* A Java Development Kit is installed.
* Maven is installed.
* The host has access to the Internet. The build process uses the Internet for downloading Maven packages from external repositories.

.Procedure
. In a terminal window, change to the `sources` directory.
. Run the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
mvn clean install
----
+
. Wait for the build process to complete.
. Use one of the following methods to run the application:
.. Run the WildFly server deployed as part of the build process:
... In the `local/appserver/wildfly-14.0.1-final/standalone/deployments` subdirectory, create the `optashift-employee-rostering-webapp-<version>.war.dodeploy` file. The `<version>` must be the same as in the existing `optashift-employee-rostering-webapp-<version>.war` symlink in the same directory.
... In the `local/appserver/wildfly-14.0.1-final/bin` subdirectory, run the `./standalone.sh` command.
.. Deploy the `optashift-employee-rostering-webapp/target/optaweb-employee-rostering-*.war` file into an existing WildFly or JBoss EAP server and start the application server.
.. Use the following commands to run a server using Maven:
+
[source,bash]
----
mvn -N wildfly:start wildfly:deploy
mvn gwt:codeserver
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If you use Maven to start the server, the UI uses the gwt codeserver and monitors the gwtui source. In this case, if you change gwtui code, the codeserver picks the changes up automatically; there is no need to rebuild the application for gwtui code changes.
====
+
Later, to stop this server, use the command:
+
[source,bash]
----
mvn -N wildfly:shutdown
----
. To access the application, enter http://localhost:8080/gwtui/gwtui.html in a web browser.
