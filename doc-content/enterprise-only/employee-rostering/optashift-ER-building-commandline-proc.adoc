= Building and running the employee rostering starter application from the command line
You can use the command line to build the employee rostering starter application and run it.

If you use this procedure, the data is stored in memory and is lost when the server is stopped. To build and run the application with a database server for persistent storage, see <<optashift-ER-building-commandline-db-proc>>.

.Prerequisites
. A Java Development Kit must be installed.
. Maven must be installed.
. The host must have access to the Internet (for downloading Maven packages from external repositories).

.Procedure
. In  aterminal window, change to the `sources` directory.
. Run the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
mvn clean install -DskipTests
----
+
. Wait for the build process to complete.
. Use one of the following methods to run the application:
.. Run the WildFly server deployed as part of the build process:
... In the `local/appserver/wildfly-11.0.0-final/standalone/deployments` subdirectory, create the `optashift-employee-rostering-webapp-<version>.war.dodeploy` file. The `<version>` must be the same as in the existing `optashift-employee-rostering-webapp-<version>.war` symlink in the same directory.
... In the `local/appserver/wildfly-11.0.0-final/bin` subdirectory, run the `./standalone.sh` command.
.. Deploy the `optashift-employee-rostering-webapp/target/optaweb-employee-rostering-*.war` file into an existing WildFly or JBoss EAP server and start the application server.
.. Use the following commands to run a server using Maven:
+
[source,bash]
----
mvn -N wildfly:start wildfly:deploy
mvn gwt:codeserver
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If you use Maven to start the server, the UI uses the gwt codeserver and monitors the gwtui source. In this case, if you change gwtui code, the codeserver picks the changes up automatically; there is no need to rebuild the application for gwtui code changes.
====
+
Later, to stop this server, use the command:
+
[source,bash]
----
mvn -N wildfly:shutdown
----
. Access the application at http://localhost:8080/gwtui/gwtui.html
