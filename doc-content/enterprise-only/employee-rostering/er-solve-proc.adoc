= Creating and viewing the employee shift roster

You can use the application to create and view the optimal shift roster for all employees.

.Procedure
. To view and edit the shift roster in the OptaWeb employee rostering application web interface, click the *Shift* tab.
. To create the optimal shift roster, click *Schedule*. The application takes 30 seconds to find the optimal solution.

.Result
When the operation is finished, the Shift Roster view contains the optimal shift roster. The new roster is created for the draft period; the operation does not modify the published periods.

In the top left part of the window, you can see the dates for which the roster is displayed. To view other weeks, you can use the *<* and *>* buttons next to the *Week of* field. Alternatively, you can click the date field and change the date to view the week that includes this date.

In the draft period, the borders of boxes that represent shifts are dotted lines. In the published periods, the borders are unbroken lines.

The color of the boxes that represent shifts shows the constraint status of every shift:

* Strong green: Soft constraint matched; for example, the shift is in a "desired" timeslot for the employee.
* Pale green: No constraint broken.
* Grey: Soft constraint broken; for example, the shift is in an "undesired" timeslot for the employee.
* Yellow: Medium constraint broken; for example, no employee is assigned to the shift.
* Red: Hard constraint broken; for example, an employee has two shifts at the same time.
