= Building and running the employee rostering starter application using Eclipse
You can use Eclipse, including Red Hat CodeReady Studio, to build the employee rostering starter application and run it.

.Prerequisites
* You have prepared the deployment files as described in <<er-deploy-prepare-proc>>.
* Eclipse is installed.
* The host has access to the Internet. The build process uses the Internet for downloading Maven packages from external repositories.
* Google Chrome is installed in order to run the application with the suggested configuration.

[NOTE]
====
You can modify the configuration to use another web browser.
====

.Procedure
. Start Eclipse.
. From the main menu, select *File* -> *Import...*.
. Select the *Maven* -> *Existing Maven projects* wizard.
. For the root directory, select the root directory of the application source.
. Click *Finish*.
. Optional: To avoid seeing many errors in Eclipse:
.. In the root directory of the application source, enter the `mvn clean install` command and wait for the build to finish.
.. In the Eclipse navigation tree, right-click `optaweb-employee-rostering-shared` and select *Build Path* -> *Configure Build Path...*.
.. Click the *Source* tab, then click *Add Folder...*.
.. Select the `optaweb-employee-rostering-shared/target/generated-sources` folder and click *OK*.
. From the main menu, select *Run* -> *External Tools* -> *External Tools Configurations...*.
. Under *Program*, create the following launch configurations:
.. Open Employee Rostering in Chrome:
*** Name: `Open Employee Rostering in Chrome`
*** Location: `/usr/bin/google-chrome`
*** Working Directory: `${workspace_loc:/optaweb-employee-rostering}`
*** Arguments: `--incognito \http://localhost:8080/gwtui/gwtui.html`
+
[NOTE]
====
You can change the name, location. and arguments to use another browser instead of Chrome.
====
+
.. Kill Code Server:
*** Name: `Kill Code Server`
*** Location: `/usr/sbin/fuser`
*** Working Directory: `${workspace_loc:/optaweb-employee-rostering}`
*** Arguments: `fuser -k 9876/tcp`
+
. From the main menu, select *Run* -> *Run Configurations...*.
. Under *Maven Build*, create the following launch configurations:
.. Employee Rostering Build:
*** Name: `Employee Rostering Build`
*** Base directory: `${workspace_loc:/optaweb-employee-rostering}`
*** Goals: `clean install`
*** Parameter: `gwt:skipCompilation` Value: `true`
+
.. Employee Rostering Start Code Server:
*** Name: `Employee Rostering Start Code Server`
*** Base directory: `${workspace_loc:/optaweb-employee-rostering}`
*** Goals: `gwt:codeserver`
*** Parameter: `gwt:skipCompilation` Value: `true`
+
.. Employee Rostering Start Webserver:
*** Name: `Employee Rostering Start Webserver`
*** Base directory: `${workspace_loc:/optaweb-employee-rostering}`
*** Goals: `wildfly:start wildfly:deploy`
*** Parameter: `gwt:skipCompilation` Value: `true`
+
.. Employee Rostering Stop Webserver:
*** Name: `Employee Rostering Stop Webserver`
*** Base directory: `${workspace_loc:/optaweb-employee-rostering}`
*** Goals: `wildfly:shutdown`
*** Parameter: `gwt:skipCompilation` Value: `true`
. Under *Launch Group*, create a launch group named `Employee Rostering Run`. Add the following launches to it:
** `Program::Kill Code Server` Launch mode: *inherit* Post launch action: *Wait until terminated*
** `Maven Build::Employee Rostering Stop Webserver` Launch mode: *inherit* Post launch action: *Wait until terminated*
** `Maven Build::Employee Rostering Build` Launch mode: *inherit* Post launch action: *Wait until terminated*
** `Maven Build::Employee Rostering Start Webserver` Launch mode: *inherit* Post launch action: none
** `Maven Build::Employee Rostering Start Code server` Launch mode: *inherit* Post launch action: *Wait for console output (regexp)*: `The code server is ready at`
** `Program::Open Employee Rostering in Chrome` Launch mode: *inherit* Post launch action: none
. To build, run, and immediately access the application, run the `Employee Rostering Run` launch group. You can then change the application and rerun the launch group to test your changes.

[NOTE]
====
When you use this method to run the application, the UI uses the gwt codeserver and monitors the gwtui source. If you change gwtui code, the codeserver picks the changes up automatically; there is no need to rebuild the application for gwtui code changes.
