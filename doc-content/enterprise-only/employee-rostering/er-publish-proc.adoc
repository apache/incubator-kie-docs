= Publishing the shift roster

When you publish the shift roster, the first week of the draft period becomes published. Automatic employee rostering no longer changes any shift assignments in the published period, though emergency manual changing is still possible. The draft period is shifted one week later. For details about draft and published periods, see <<er-periods-con>>.

.Procedure
. To view and edit the shift roster, click the *Shift Roster* tab.
. Review the shift roster for the first week of the draft period to ensure that it is acceptable.
. Click *Publish*.
