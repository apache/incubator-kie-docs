The `OneEmployeeShiftPerDay` guided rule creates a hard constraint that employees are not assigned more than one shift per day. In the employee rostering example, this constraint is created using the guided rule designer.

.Procedure
. In {CENTRAL}, go to *Menu* -> *Design* -> *Projects* and click the project name.
. Click *Add Asset* -> *Guided Rule*.
. Enter `OneEmployeeShiftPerDay` as the *Guided Rule* name and select the `employeerostering.employeerostering` *Package*. 
. Click *Ok* to create the rule asset.
. Add a *WHEN* condition by clicking the image:employee-rostering/5686.png[] in the *WHEN* field.
. Select *Free form DRL* from the *Add a condition to the rule* window.
. In the free form DRL box, type the following condition:
+
[source,java]
----
$shiftAssignment : ShiftAssignment( employee != null )
		ShiftAssignment( this != $shiftAssignment , employee == $shiftAssignment.employee , shift.timeslot.startTime.toLocalDate() == $shiftAssignment.shift.timeslot.startTime.toLocalDate() )
----
+
This condition states that a shift cannot be assigned to an employee that already has another shift assignment on the same day.

+
[source,java]
----
scoreHolder.addHardConstraintMatch(kcontext, -1);
----

. Click *Validate* in the upper-right corner to check all rule conditions are valid. If the rule validation fails, address any problems described in the error message, review all components in the rule, and try again to validate the rule until the rule passes.
