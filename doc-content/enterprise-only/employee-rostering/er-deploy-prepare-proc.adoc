= Preparing deployment files

You must download and prepare the deployment files before building and deploying the application.

.Procedure

. Download the `{PRODUCT_FILE}-add-ons.zip` file from the {PRODUCT_DOWNLOAD_LINK}[Software Downloads] page for {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}.
. Unzip the downloaded archive.
. Unzip the `{PRODUCT_FILE}-employee-rostering.zip` file that is extracted from the add-ons archive. 
+
The `employee-rostering-distribution-{MAVEN_ARTIFACT_VERSION}` folder is created. This folder is the base folder in subsequent parts of this document. 
+
[NOTE]
====
File and folder names might have higher version numbers than specifically noted in this document.
====
. As of version 7.3.0, an additional setting is required in order to build the application from source. You must make the `jboss-public-group` Maven repository, located at https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/groups/public/ , available to your build.
+
To make this repository available, modify the `sources/pom.xml` file in the extracted source code. Add the following content immediately before the `<repositories>` tag:
+
[source,xml]

<pluginRepositories>
    <pluginRepository>
      <id>jboss-public-group</id>
      <name>JBoss Public Maven Repository</name>
      <url>https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/groups/public/</url>

Alternatively, you can customize the Maven `settings.xml` file to make this repository available. For details about using and changing a `settings.xml` file, see the https://maven.apache.org/settings.html[Maven settings reference].
