= Preparing deployment files

You must download and prepare the deployment files before building and deploying the application.

.Procedure

. Download the `{PRODUCT_FILE}-add-ons.zip` file from the {PRODUCT_DOWNLOAD_LINK}[Software Downloads] page for {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}.
. Unzip the downloaded archive.
. Unzip the employee rostering zip file (`{PRODUCT_FILE}-employee-rostering.zip`) that is extracted from the add-ons archive.

.Result
When you unzip the employee rostering zip file, the `optashift-employee-rostering-{MAVEN_ARTIFACT_VERSION}` folder is created. This folder is the base folder in subsequent steps. 

NOTE: File and folder names might have higher version numbers than specifically noted in this document.
