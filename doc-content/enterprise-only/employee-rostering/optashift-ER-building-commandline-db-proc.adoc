= Building and running the employee rostering starter application with persistent data storage from the command line

If you use the command line to build the employee rostering starter application and run it, you can provide a database server for persistent data storage.

.Prerequisites
. A Java Development Kit must be installed.
. Maven must be installed.
. The host must have access to the Internet (for downloading Maven packages from external repositories).
. You must have a deployed WildFly or {EAP} application server and a deployed MySQL or PostrgeSQL database server. 
. You must set up a JDBC data source in the application server for the database server.

.Procedure
. In a terminal window, change to the `sources` directory.
. Run the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
mvn clean install  -DproductizedOpenshift -Dorg.optaweb.employeerostering.persistence.datasource=<dsname> -Dorg.optaweb.employeerostering.persistence.dialect=<dialect>
----
+
In the preceding command, replace the following values:
+
** _<dsname>_ with the name of the data source in the application server.
** _<dialect>_ with one of the following strings, depending on the type of database server:
*** For MySQL, `org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL5Dialect`
*** For PostgreSQL, `org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect` 
+
. Wait for the build process to complete.
. Deploy the `optashift-employee-rostering-webapp/target/optaweb-employee-rostering-7.18.0.Final-redhat-{MAVEN_ARTIFACT_VERSION}.war` directory into the application server and start the application server.
. Access the application at http://localhost:8080/gwtui/gwtui.html
