= Installing and starting the employee rostering starter application on OpenShift

You can use an OpenShift template or the `runOnOpenShift.sh` script to deploy the Employee Rostering starter application to {OPENSHIFT}. The  `runOnOpenShift.sh` shell script is available in the *{PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION_LONG} Kogito and OptaPlanner 8 Decision Services Quickstarts* distribution.

If you use an OpenShift template, {OPENSHIFT} loads an image with the application from the Red Hat repository and deploys it. This method of deployment is a technology preview feature.
// Christopher, is this still technology preview?

The `runOnOpenShift.sh` script builds and packages the application source code locally and uploads it to the OpenShift environment for deployment.  This method requires Java Development Kit, Apache Maven, and a bash shell command line.
