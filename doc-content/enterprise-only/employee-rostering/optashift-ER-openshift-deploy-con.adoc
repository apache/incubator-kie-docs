= Installing and starting the employee rostering starter application on OpenShift

You can deploy the {PLANNER} Employee Rostering starter application to {OPENSHIFT} using the `provision.sh` shell script that is provided in the add-ons distribution. 

The application source code is built and packaged locally and uploaded to the OpenShift environment for deployment.  Use this preferred method when Java developer tools (Java Development Kit and Maven) and a bash shell command line are available. 

IMPORTANT: The data is held in memory and lost when the pod is restarted.
