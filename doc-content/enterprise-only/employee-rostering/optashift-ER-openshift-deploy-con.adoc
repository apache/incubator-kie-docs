= Installing and starting the employee rostering starter application on OpenShift

You can deploy the {PLANNER} Employee Rostering starter application to {OPENSHIFT} using an OpenShift template or using the `provision.sh` shell script that is provided in the reference implementation distribution.

If you use an OpenShift template, {OPENSHIFT} loads an image with the application from the Red Hat repository and deploys it. This method of deployment is a technological preview.

If you use the script, it builds and packages the application source code locally and uploads it to the OpenShift environment for deployment.  You can use this method when Java developer tools (Java Development Kit and Maven) and a bash shell command line are available.
