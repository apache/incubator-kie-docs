= Installing and starting the employee rostering starter application on OpenShift

Use the `runOnOpenShift.sh` script to deploy the Employee Rostering starter application to {OPENSHIFT}. The  `runOnOpenShift.sh` shell script is available in the *{PRODUCT_PAM} {PRODUCT_VERSION_LONG} Kogito and OptaPlanner 8 Decision Services Quickstarts* distribution.

The `runOnOpenShift.sh` script builds and packages the application source code locally and uploads it to the OpenShift environment for deployment.  This method requires Java Development Kit, Apache Maven, and a bash shell command line.
