= Installing and starting the employee rostering starter application on OpenShift

You can deploy the Employee Rostering starter application to {OPENSHIFT} using an OpenShift template or using the `provision.sh` shell script that is provided in the reference implementation distribution.

The `runOnOpenShift.sh` script builds and packages the application source code locally and uploads it to the OpenShift environment for deployment.  This method requires Java Development Kit, Apache Maven, and a bash shell command line.
