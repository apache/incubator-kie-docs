= The rotation pattern

The employee rostering application supports a _rotation pattern_ for shifts and employees.

The rotation pattern is a "model" period of any time starting from two days. The pattern is not tied to a particular date.

You can create time buckets for every day of the rotation. Every time bucket sets the time of a shift. Optionally, the template can include the name of the default employee for the shift.

When you publish the roster, the application adds a new week to the draft period. At this time, the shifts and, if applicable, default employee names are copied from the rotation pattern to the new part of the draft period.

When the end of the rotation pattern is reached, it is automatically restarted from the beginning.

If weekend shift patterns in your organization are different from weekday shift patterns, use a rotation pattern of one week or a whole number of weeks, for example, 14, 21, or 28 days. The default length is 28 days. Then the pattern is always repeated on the same weekdays and you can set the shifts for different weekdays.

For instructions about editing the rotation pattern, see <<er-rotation-edit-proc>>.
