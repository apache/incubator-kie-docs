= Entering the list of contracts

You must enter the list of all of the types of contracts that the business uses for employees.

A contract determines the maximum time that the employee can work in a day, calendar week, calendar month, or calendar year.

When creating a contract, you can set any of the limitations or none at all. For example, a part-time employee might not be allowed to work more than 20 hours in a week, while a full-time employee might be limited to 10 hours in a day and 1800 hours in a year. Another contract might include no limitations on worked hours.

You must enter all work time limits for contracts in minutes.
