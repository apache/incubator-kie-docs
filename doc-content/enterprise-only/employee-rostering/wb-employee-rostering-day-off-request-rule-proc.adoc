= Create a guided rule to manage day off requests

The `DayOffRequest` guided rule creates a soft constraint that allows a shift to be reassigned to another employee in the event the employee who was originally assigned the shift is no longer able to work that day. In the employee rostering example, this constraint is created using the guided rule designer.
