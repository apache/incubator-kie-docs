= Employee rostering constraints

Employee rostering is a planning problem. All planning problems include constraints that must be satisfied in order to find an optimal solution.

The employee rostering sample project in {CENTRAL} includes the following hard and soft constraints:

Hard constraint::
* Employees are only assigned one shift per day.
* All shifts that require a particular employee skill are assigned an employee with that particular skill.

Soft constraints::
* All employees are assigned a shift.
* If an employee requests a day off, their shift is reassigned to another employee.

Hard and soft constraints are defined in {CENTRAL} using either the free-form DRL designer, or using guided rules.

//For more information about hard and soft constraints, see {URL_INSTALLING_PLANNER}[_{INSTALLING_PLANNER}_].
