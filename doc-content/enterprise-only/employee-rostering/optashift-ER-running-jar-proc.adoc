= Running the Employee Rostering starter application JAR file
You can run the Employee Rostering starter application from a JAR file included in the reference implementation download.

.Prerequisites
* You have downloaded and extracted the `{PRODUCT_FILE}-reference-implementation.zip` file as described in <<er-deploy-prepare-proc>>.
* A Java Development Kit is installed.
* Maven is installed.
* The host has access to the Internet. The build process uses the Internet for downloading Maven packages from external repositories.

.Procedure
. In a command terminal, change to the `sources` directory.
. Enter the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
mvn clean install
----
+
. Wait for the build process to complete.
. Navigate to the `optaweb-employee-rostering-distribution-{MAVEN_ARTIFACT_VERSION}/sources/optaweb-employee-rostering-standalone/target` directory.
. Enter the following command to run the Employee Rostering JAR file:
+
[source,xml,subs="attributes+"]
----
java -jar optaweb-employee-rostering-standalone-*-exec.jar
----
+
NOTE: This command starts the employee rostering application with a non-production database. To start the employee rostering application with a production database, add the `--spring.profiles.active=production` argument to the preceding command.

. To access the application, enter `\http://localhost:8080/` in a web browser.
