= Deploying the application using the template

To deploy the application using the template, you must first ensure that the image streams for {PRODUCT} are available and configure OpenShift registry authentication. Then you can deploy the template.

The template deploys a pod with the Employee Rostering starter application and a separate pod with a PostgreSQL database server. The application uses the database server for persistent storage of all the information that it uses.

.Prerequisites
* You must be logged in to the target OpenShift environment using the Web UI or using the `oc` command line tool. For more information about this tool, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/3.11/html-single/cli_reference/[CLI Reference].
