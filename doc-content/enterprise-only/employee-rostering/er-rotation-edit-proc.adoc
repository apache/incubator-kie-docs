= Viewing and editing the rotation pattern
The rotation pattern enables you to add, move, and delete shifts so you can manage your employee resources efficiently. It is defined by time buckets and seats.

* A time bucket describes a time slot (for example, 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.) for a particular spot or location *(A)* (for example, Anaesthetics), over two or more days, and any skills that are required (for example, firearm training).
* A seat *(B)* is an employee assignment for a particular day in a specific time bucket.
* An employee stub is an icon that represents an employee that is available to be assigned to a time bucket.
Employee stubs are listed in the *Employee Stub List*.

For more information about the rotation pattern, see <<er-rotation-con>>.
