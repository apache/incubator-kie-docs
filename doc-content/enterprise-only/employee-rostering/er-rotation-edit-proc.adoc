= Viewing and editing the rotation pattern

The rotation pattern contains shift templates that are automatically replicated for every period. For details about the rotation pattern, see <<er-rotation-con>>.

You can view the rotation pattern, add, move, and delete shifts.

.Procedure
. To view and edit the rotation pattern in the Employee Rostering application web interface, click the *Rotation* tab.
. To view additional days of the rotation pattern, use the horizontal scroll bar at the bottom of the browser window.
. To add a shift template, click an empty area of the table. The application adds a shift, determining the slot and time span automatically from the location of the click.
. To edit a shift template, click the shift template. You can set the following values:
** *From* and *To* day and time: The exact time and duration of the shift. The day is counted from the start of the rotation period.
** *Rotation employee*: The employee assigned to the shift by default. Select *Unassigned* if you do not want to assign any employee to this shift by default; in this case, the rostering process determines the employee in the shift without a preferred value.
+
To save the changes, click *Apply*.
. To delete a shift template, hold the *Shift* key on the keyboard and click a te shift template. Alternatively, click the shift template and then click *Delete shift template*.
