= Create the employee roster planning entity

In order to solve the employee rostering planning problem, you must create a planning entity and a solver. The planning entity is defined in the domain designer using the attributes available in the {PLANNER} dock. 

Use the following procedure to define the `ShiftAssignment` data object as the planning entity for the employee rostering example.

.Prerequisite
* You have created the relevant data objects and planning entity required to run the employee rostering example by completing the procedures in <<wb-employee-rostering-data-model-proc>>.

.Procedure 
. From the project *Assets* menu, open the `ShiftAssignment` data object.
. In the *Data Objects* perspective, open the {PLANNER} dock by clicking the image:employee-rostering/optimizer-icon.png[{PLANNER} icon] on the right.
. Select *Planning Entity*.
. Select `employee` from the list of fields under the `ShiftAssignment` data object.
. In the {PLANNER} dock, select *Planning Variable*.
+ 
In the *Value Range Id* input field, type `employeeRange`. This adds the `@ValueRangeProvider` annotation to the planning entity, which you can view by clicking the `Source` tab in the designer.
+
The value range of a planning variable is defined with the `@ValueRangeProvider` annotation. A `@ValueRangeProvider` annotation always has a property `id`, which is referenced by the `@PlanningVariable` property `valueRangeProviderRefs`. 

. Close the dock and click *Save* to save the data object.
