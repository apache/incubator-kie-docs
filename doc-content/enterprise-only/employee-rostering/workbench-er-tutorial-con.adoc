= Getting started with OptaPlanner in {CENTRAL}: An employee rostering example

You can build and deploy the `employee-rostering` sample project in {CENTRAL}. The project  demonstrates how to create each of the {CENTRAL} assets required to solve the shift rostering planning problem and use {PLANNER} to find the best possible solution.

You can deploy the preconfigured `employee-rostering` project in {CENTRAL}. Alternatively, you can create the project yourself using {CENTRAL}.

[NOTE]
====
The `employee-rostering` sample project in {CENTRAL} does not include a data set. You must supply a data set in XML format using a REST API call.
