= Entering spots

You must enter the list of _spots_, which represent various positions at the business. For a diner, spots include the bar, the bussing stations, the front counter, the various kitchen stations, the serving areas, and the office. 

For each spot, you can select one or more required skills from the list that you entered in the *Skills* tab. The application rosters only employees that have all of the required skills for a spot into that spot. If the spot has no required skill, the application can roster any employee into the spot.
