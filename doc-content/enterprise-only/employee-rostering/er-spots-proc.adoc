= Entering spots

You must enter the list of _spots_, which represent various positions at the business. For a diner, spots include the bar, the bussing stations, the front counter, the various kitchen stations, the serving areas, and the office.

For each spot, you can select one or more required skills from the list that you entered in the *Skills* tab. The application rosters only employees that have all of the required skills for a spot into that spot. If the spot has no required skill, the application can roster any employee into the spot.

.Procedure

. To enter or change spots in the Employee Rostering application web interface, click the *Spots* tab. You can enter any part of a spot name in the *Search* box to search for spots.
. Complete the following steps to add a new spot:
.. Click *Add Spot*.
.. Enter the name of the new spot in the text field under *Name*.
.. Optionally, select one or more skills from the drop-down list under *Required skill set*.
.. Click the Save icon.
. To edit the name and required skills for a spot, click the *Edit Spot* icon (pencil shape) next to the spot.
. To delete a spot, click the *Delete Spot* icon (trashcan shape) next to the spot.

NOTE: Within each tenant, spot names must be unique. You cannot delete a spot when any shifts are created for it.
