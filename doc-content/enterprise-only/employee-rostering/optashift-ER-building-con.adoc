= Building and running the employee rostering starter application
You can build the employee rostering starter application from the source code and run it using a JBoss EAP or WildFly application server. 

You can use the command line to build the application, then install it into a stand-alone server.

Alternatively, you can use your IDE, for example, Eclipse (including Red Hat CodeReady Studio), to build and run the application.

You can also deploy and run the pre-built WAR file that is supplied with the source code.

For information about using the application, see {URL_RUNNING_ROSTER_FOR_PLANNER_OPENSHIFT}[{RUNNING_ROSTER_FOR_PLANNER_OPENSHIFT}].
