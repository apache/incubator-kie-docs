= Run the OptaWeb Vehicle Routing runLocally.sh script in interactive mode

Use interactive mode to see the list of downloaded OSM files and country codes assigned to each region.
You can use the interactive mode to download additional OSM files from Geofabrik without visiting the website and choosing a destination for the download.


.Prerequisites
* OptaWeb Vehicle Routing has been successfully built with Maven as described in xref:download-ref-imp-proc_{context}[].
* Internet access is available.

.Procedure
. Change directory to the `{PRODUCT_INIT}-{PRODUCT_VERSION_LONG}-optaweb-vehicle-routing/sources` directory.
. Enter the following command to run the script in interactive mode:
+
[source]
----
./runLocally.sh -i
----

. Download a region or select a region that was downloaded previously.
* Download a region.
.. At the `Your choice` prompt, enter `d` to display the download menu. The first region appears.

COMMENT: I've been playing with this to try to figure out how it works. Maybe I can get a demo from Jira on Monday.

.. Go to a region by entering its ID and then entering `e`.

COMMENT:How do I know a region's ID? Is there a list?
.. Repeat the previous step until you see a list with the region you want to download.
.. To download a region, enter the region's ID and then enter `d`.
+
[WARNING]
.Using large OSM files
====
For the best user experience, use smaller regions such as individual European or US states.
Using OSM files larger than 1 GB will require significant RAM size and take a lot of time (up to several hours) for the initial processing.
====

* Select a region that was previously downloaded.
.. To select a region from the list of downloaded regions, enter the region ID.
+
COMMENT: These steps seem odd. Does OptaWeb just start after I select a region? Do I press enter?
.. Confirm the project build if it hasn't been built yet.
.. Confirm starting OptaWeb Vehicle Routing using the selected region.
