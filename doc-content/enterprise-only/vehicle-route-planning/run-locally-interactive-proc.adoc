[WARNING]
.Using large OSM files
====
For the best user experience, use smaller regions such as individual European or US states.
Using OSM files larger than 1 GB will require significant RAM size and take a lot of time (up to several hours) for the initial processing.
====
+
The application starts after the OSM file is downloaded.
