= Run OptaWeb Vehicle Routing

//TODO make this a prerequisite of build procedure
//==== Internet access
//
//You need internet access when you build and run the application.
//The application source code depends on Maven and NPM packages that will be downloaded during build.
//When the application runs it uses third party, public services such as link:https://www.openstreetmap.org/about[OpenStreetMap]
//to display map tiles and provide search results.



After you download OptaWeb Vehicle Routing and extract the distribution archive, use the `runLocally.sh` script to run it.

NOTE: If the standalone JAR is not part of the distribution, build the project from source by using the `sources` directory.
You can use the `sources` directory inside the distribution as if you have cloned the source repository from GitHub.
// TODO build instructions

NOTE: If Bash is not available on your system, follow the instructions in xref:run-vrp-manually-proc_{context}[] .
