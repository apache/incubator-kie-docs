= Quarkus development mode

In development mode, the backend automatically restarts whenever you refresh the browser tab where the front end runs if there are any changes in the back-end source code or configuration.

Learn more about https://quarkus.io/guides/maven-tooling#development-mode[Quarkus development mode].

IntelliJ IDEA saves changes automatically and you need to select either *Build[Recompile]*, which recompiles the file in the active tab, or *Build[Build Project]* which recompiles all changes.
