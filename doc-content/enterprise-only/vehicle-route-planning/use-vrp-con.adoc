= Using OptaWeb Vehicle Routing

In the OptaWeb Vehicle Routing application, you can mark a number of locations on the map.
The first location is assumed to be the depot.
Vehicles must deliver goods from this depot to every other location that you marked.

You can set the number of vehicles and the carrying capacity of every vehicle.
However, the route is not guaranteed to use all vehicles.
The application uses as many vehicles as required for an optimal route.

The current version has certain limitations:

* Every delivery to a location is supposed to take one point of vehicle capacity.
For example, a vehicle with a capacity of 10 can visit up to 10 locations before returning to the depot.
* Setting custom names of vehicles and locations is not supported.
