= Update the data directory

You can update the data directory that OptaWeb Vehicle Planner uses.

.Prerequisites
* OptaWeb Vehicle Routing has been successfully built with Maven as described in xref:download-ref-imp-proc_{context}[].

.Procedure
* To use a different data directory, write its absolute path to the `.DATA_DIR_LAST` file in the project root directory.
* To change country codes associated with a region, edit the corresponding file under `DATA_DIR/country_codes`.
+
For example, if downloaded an OSM file for Scotland and the script fails to guess the country code, set the content of `DATA_DIR/country_codes/scotland-latest` to GB.

* To remove a region, delete the corresponding OSM file from `DATA_DIR/openstreetmap/` and delete the `DATA_DIR/graphhopper/`.
