= Using OptaWeb Vehicle Routing

In the OptaWeb Vehicle Routing application, you can mark a number of locations on the map.
The first location is assumed to be the depot.
Vehicles must deliver goods from this depot to every other location that you marked.

You can set the number of vehicles and the carrying capacity of every vehicle.
However, the route is not guaranteed to use all vehicles.
The application uses as many vehicles as required for an optimal route.

The current version has certain limitations:

* Every delivery to a location is supposed to take 1 point of vehicle capacity.
For example, a vehicle with a capacity of 10 can visit up to 10 locations before returning to the depot.
* Setting custom names of vehicles and locations is not supported.
* Error information is not supported in the user interface.
You must view the terminal output of the back end to see detailed error messages.

== Creating a route

To create an optimal route, use the *Demo* tab of the user interface.

. Click *Demo* to open the *Demo* tab.
. Use the blue icon:minus-square[role="blue"] and icon:plus-square[role="blue"] buttons above the map to set the number of vehicles.
Each vehicle has a default capacity of 10.
. Use the icon:plus-square-o[] button on the map to zoom in as necessary.

[NOTE]
====
Do not double-click to zoom in.
A double click also creates a location.
====
+
. Click a location for the depot.
. Click other locations on the map for delivery points.
. If you want to delete a location:
.. Hover the mouse cursor over the location to see the location name.
.. Find the location name in the list in the left part of the screen.
.. Click the icon:times[role="blue"] icon next to the name.

Every time you add or remove a location or change the number of vehicles, the application creates and displays a new optimal route.
If the solution uses several vehicles, the application shows the route for every vehicle in a different color.

== Viewing and setting other details

You can use other tabs of the user interface to view and set additional details.

* In the *Vehicles* tab, you can view, add, and remove vehicles, and also set the capacity for every vehicle.
* In the *Visits* tab, you can view and remove locations.
* In the *Route* tab, you can select every vehicle and view the route for this vehicle.

== Troubleshooting

If the application behaves unexpectedly, review the back end terminal output log.

To resolve issues, remove the back end database:

. Stop the back end by pressing kbd:[Ctrl+C] in the back end terminal window.
. Remove the directory `optaweb-vehicle-routing/optaweb-vehicle-routing-backend/local/db`.
