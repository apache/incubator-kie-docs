= Setting OptaWeb Vehicle Routing back end module configuration

.Prerequisites
* The OptaWeb Vehicle Routing reference implementation has been downloaded and extracted. For information, see xref:download-ref-imp-proc_{context}[].

[source]
----
-D<PROPERTY>=<VALUE>
----
* To change configuration value permanently, for example to store a configuration that is specific to your development environment, update the `optaweb-vehicle-routing-backend/.env` file.
//What does this mean? How do I use it? Just copy the contents?
Use optaweb-vehicle-routing-backend/.env-example to initialize your own optaweb-vehicle-routing-backend/.env file.

+
This file is excluded from version control and so it does not exist when you clone the repository.  You can make changes in the .env file without affecting the Git working tree.
