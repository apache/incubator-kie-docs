= Run OptaWeb Vehicle Routing locally using the runLocally.sh script

Linux users can use the `runLocally.sh` Bash script to run OptaWeb Vehicle Routing.

NOTE: The `runLocally.sh` script does not run on macOS. If you cannot use the `runLocally.sh` script, see xref:run-vrp-manually-proc_{context}[].

The `runLocally.sh` script automates the following setup steps that otherwise must be carried out manually:

* Create the data directory.
* Download selected OpenStreetMap (OSM) files from Geofabrik.
* Try to associate a country code with each downloaded OSM file automatically.
* Build the project if the standalone JAR file does not exist.
* Launch OptaWeb Vehicle Routing by taking a single region argument or by selecting the region interactively.
