[NOTE]
====
The data set directory is the directory specified in the `app.demo.data-set-dir` property.

If the application is running through the `runLocally.sh` script, the data set directory is set to `$HOME/{VRP-DATA-DIR}/dataset`.

Otherwise, the property is taken from the `application.properties` file and defaults to `{PRODUCT_INIT}-{PRODUCT_VERSION_LONG}-decision-services-quickstarts/optaweb-{OPTAPLANNER_BOM_VERSION}/{URL_COMPONENT_VRP}/optaweb-vehicle-routing-standalone/target/local/dataset`.

You can edit the `app.demo.data-set-dir` property to specify a diffent data directory.
====
. Edit the YAML file and choose a unique name for the data set.
. Restart the back end.

After you restart the back end, files in the data set directory appear in the *Load demo* menu.
