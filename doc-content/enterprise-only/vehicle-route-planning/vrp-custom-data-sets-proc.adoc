= Creating custom data sets with OptaWeb Vehicle Routing

There is a built-in demo data set consisting of a several large Belgian cities.
If you want to have more demos available in the *Load demo* menu, you can prepare your own data sets.

.Procedure
To do that, follow these steps:

. In OptaWeb Vehicle Routing, add a depot and a number of visits by clicking on the map or using geosearch.
. Click *Export* and save the file in the data set_directory.

[NOTE]
====
The data set directory is the directory specified in the `app.demo.data-set-dir` property.

If the application is running through the `runLocally.sh` script, the data set directory is set to `$HOME/{VRP-DATA-DIR}/dataset`.

Otherwise, the property is from `application.properties` and defaults to `{URL_COMPONENT_VRP}-distribution-{MAVEN_ARTIFACT_VERSION}/sources/optaweb-vehicle-routing-standalone/target/local/dataset`.

You can edit the `app.demo.data-set-dir` property to specify a diffent data directory.
====
. Edit the YAML file and choose a unique name for the data set.
. Restart the back end.

After you restart the back end, files in the data set directory appear in the *Load demo* menu.
