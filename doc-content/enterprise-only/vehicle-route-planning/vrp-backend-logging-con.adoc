= OptaWeb Vehicle Routing backend logging

OptaWeb Vehicle Routing uses the SLF4J API and Logback as the logging framework.
The Spring environment enables you to configure most logging aspects, including levels, patterns, and log files, in the same way as other configuration properties. The most common ways to set logging properties are by editing the `application.properties` file or using arguments such as `<PROPERTY>=<VALUE>` where `<PROPERTY>` is the name of a property and `<VALUE>` is the value of that property.
See the https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/spring-boot-features.html#boot-features-custom-log-levels[Spring Boot Logging]
documentation for more information.

The following examples are properties that you can use to control logging level of some parts of the application:

* `logging.level.org.optaweb.vehiclerouting=debug`:  Enables the debug level for the back end code
* `logging.level.org.optaplanner.core=warn`: Reduces {PLANNER} logging
* `logging.level.org.springframework.web.socket=trace`: Accesses more details when investigating problems with WebSocket connection
