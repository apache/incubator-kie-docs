= Run the OptaWeb Vehicle Routing runLocally.sh script in air distance mode

OptaWeb Vehicle Routing can work in air distance mode that calculates travel times based on the distance between two coordinates.
Use this mode in situations where you need to get OptaWeb Vehicle Routing up and running as quickly as possible and do not want to use an OSM (OpenStreetMap) file.
Air distance mode is only useful if you need to smoke-test OptaWeb Vehicle Routing and you do not need accurate travel times.

.Prerequisites
* OptaWeb Vehicle Routing has been successfully built with Maven as described in xref:download-ref-imp-proc_{context}[].
* Internet access is available.


.Procedure
. Change directory to `kogito-1.5.0-decision-services-quickstarts/optaweb-{OPTAPLANNER_BOM_VERSION}/{URL_COMPONENT_VRP}`.
. Run the `runLocally.sh` script with the `--air` argument to start OptaWeb Vehicle Routing in air distance mode:
+
[source,bash]
----
