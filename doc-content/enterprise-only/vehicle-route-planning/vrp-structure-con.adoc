The back-end and front-end modules are at the bottom of the module tree. These modules contain the application source code.

The standalone module is an assembly module that combines the back end and front end into a single executable JAR file.

The distribution module represents the final assembly step.
It takes the standalone application and the documentation and wraps them in an archive that is easy to distribute.

The back end and front end are separate projects that you can build and deploy separately.
In fact, they are written in completely different languages and built with different tools.
Both projects have tools that provide a modern developer experience with fast turn-around between code changes and the running application.
