= Run the OptaWeb Vehicle Routing runLocally.sh script in non-interactive mode

Use the non-interactive mode to specify an existing region and start OptaWeb Vehicle Routing with a single command.
This is useful for switching between regions quickly or when doing a demo.

.Prerequisites
* OptaWeb Vehicle Routing has been successfully built with Maven as described in xref:download-ref-imp-proc_{context}[].
* The OSM file for the region that you want to use has been downloaded. For information about downloading OSM files, see xref:run-locally-interactive-proc_{context}[].
* Internet access is available.


.Procedure
. Change directory to the `{PRODUCT_INIT}-{PRODUCT_VERSION_LONG}-optaweb-vehicle-routing/sources` directory.
. Execute the following command where `<REGION>` is a two letter country code for a region that you previously downloaded. For a list of country codes, see https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html[_ISO 3166 Country Codes_].
