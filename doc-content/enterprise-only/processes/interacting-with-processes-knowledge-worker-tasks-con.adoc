A task is a part of the business process flow that a given user can claim and perform. You can handle tasks from the *Task Inbox* page of {CENTRAL}. It displays the task list for the logged-in user. A task can be assigned to a particular user, multiple users, or to a group of users. If assigned to multiple users or a group of users, it is visible in the task lists of all the users and any user can claim the task. When a task is claimed by a user, it is removed from the task list of other users.

This chapter covers the actions which a user can perform on tasks when executing a business process.
