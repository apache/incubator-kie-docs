= Defining special filters for process instances

You can create special process instance filters using the *Advanced* filters option in {CENTRAL}. The process instance list view changes when a filter over the column `processId` is defined. Once you create and apply the special filter, you can view the process instance variables from the specific process id as columns using the *Show/hide columns* option.

.Procedure
. In {CENTRAL}, click *Menu* -> *Manage* -> *Process Instances*.
. On the *Manage Process Instances* page, click the *Advanced Filters* icon.
. In the *Advanced Filters* pane, enter the name and description of the filter, and click *Add New*.
. Select the `processId` attribute from the *Select column* drop-down list. The content of the drop-down will change to *processId != value1*.
. Click the drop-down again and choose *equals to* as the logical query.
. Change the value of the text field to the name of the process id.
. Click *Save* and the filter is applied on the current process instance list.
. Click *Show/hide columns* on the upper right of the process instances list and the process instance variables of the specified process id will be displayed.
