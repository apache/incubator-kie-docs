= Process instance migration

Process instance migration (PIM) is a standalone service containing a user interface and a back-end. It is packaged as a Quarkus mutable JAR file. You can use the PIM service to define the migration between two different process definitions, known as a migration plan. The user can then apply the migration plan to the running process instance in a specific {KIE_SERVER}.

For more information about the PIM service, see https://github.com/kiegroup/process-migration-service[Process Instance Migration Service] in https://github.com/kiegroup[_KIE (Drools, OptaPlanner and jBPM )_].
