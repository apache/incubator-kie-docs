= Migrating business processes from new to legacy process designer

You can migrate a business process from the new process designer in {CENTRAL} to the legacy process designer. By default, all business processes open in the new process designer. But once you migrate a business process, it will always open in the legacy designer.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Migrating business processes is an irreversible process.
====

.Procedure
. Log in to {CENTRAL} and click *Menu* -> *Projects*.
. From *Assets* tab, select the business process. It will open in the new process designer.
. Click *Migrate* and a warning will appear.
. Click *Migrate Diagram*.
+
The process designer restarts and the business process re-opens in the legacy process designer.

*Migrating* a business process results in two changes:

* The name of the business process in the process designer changes, for example:

** Name in new process designer: business-process-name.bpmn - Business Processes

** Name in legacy process designer: business-process-name.bpmn2 - Business Processes (legacy)

* The extension of the business process changes from *.bpmn to *.bpmn2.
