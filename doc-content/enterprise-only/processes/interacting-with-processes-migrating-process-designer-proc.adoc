= Migrating business processes from new to legacy process designer

You can migrate a business process from the new process designer in {CENTRAL} to the legacy process designer. By default, all business processes open in the new process designer. But once you migrate a business process, it will always open in the legacy designer.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Migrating business processes is an irreversible process.
====

.Procedure
. In {CENTRAL}, go to *Menu* -> *Projects*.
. From the *Assets* tab, select the business process. The process opens in the new process designer.
. Click *Migrate*, review the warning message, and click *Migrate Diagram*.
+
The process designer restarts and the business process reopens in the legacy process designer.

When you migrate a business process to the legacy process designer, the name and file extension of the business process changes as shown in the following example:

* Name in new process designer: *business-process-name.bpmn - Business Processes*
* Name in legacy process designer: *business-process-name.bpmn2 - Business Processes (legacy)*
