= Deploying the pizzaPlace project

The following chapter instructs you how to build and deploy a new instance of the *pizzaPlace* order business process in {PRODUCT}.

.Prerequisites
The {KIE_SERVER} is deployed and connected to the {CENTRAL}. For more information, see {URL_INSTALLING_ON_EAP}[_{INSTALLING_ON_EAP}_].

.Procedure

. In {CENTRAL}, go to *Menu* -> *Design* -> *Projects*.
. Click the project you want to deploy, for example *pizzaPlace*.
. Click *Deploy*.

[NOTE]
====
You can also select the *Build & Install* option to build the project and publish the KJAR file to the configured Maven repository without deploying to a {KIE_SERVER}. This option is equivalent to running `mvn clean install` for your project in the command terminal. In a development environment, you can click *Deploy* to deploy the built KJAR file to a {KIE_SERVER} without aborting any running instances (if applicable), or click *Redeploy* to deploy the built KJAR file and abort any running instances. In a production environment, the *Redeploy* option is disabled and you can click *Deploy* only to deploy the built KJAR file to a new deployment unit (KIE container) on a {KIE_SERVER}.

To enable development mode in {CENTRAL}, go to project *Settings* -> *General Settings* -> *Version* and toggle the *Development Mode* option. Do not use *Development Mode* or manually add the `SNAPSHOT` version suffix for a production environment.
