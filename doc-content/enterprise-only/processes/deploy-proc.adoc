= Deploying the pizzaPlace project

The following chapter instructs you how to build and deploy a new instance of the *pizzaPlace* order business process in {PRODUCT}.

.Prerequisites
* {KIE_SERVER} is deployed and connected to {CENTRAL}. For more information, see {URL_INSTALLING_ON_EAP}[_{INSTALLING_ON_EAP}_].

.Procedure

. In {CENTRAL}, go to *Menu* -> *Design* -> *Projects*.
. Click the project you want to deploy, for example *pizzaPlace*.
. Click *Deploy*.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can also select the *Build & Install* option to build the project and publish the KJAR file to the configured Maven repository without deploying to a {KIE_SERVER}. In a development environment, you can click *Deploy* to deploy the built KJAR file to a {KIE_SERVER} without stopping any running instances (if applicable), or click *Redeploy* to deploy the built KJAR file and replace all instances. The next time you deploy or redeploy the built KJAR, the previous deployment unit (KIE container) is automatically updated in the same target {KIE_SERVER}. In a production environment, the *Redeploy* option is disabled and you can click *Deploy* only to deploy the built KJAR file to a new deployment unit (KIE container) on a {KIE_SERVER}.

To configure the {KIE_SERVER} environment mode, set the `org.kie.server.mode` system property to `org.kie.server.mode=development` or `org.kie.server.mode=production`. To configure the deployment behavior for a corresponding project in {CENTRAL}, go to project *Settings* -> *General Settings* -> *Version* and toggle the *Development Mode* option. By default, {KIE_SERVER} and all new projects in {CENTRAL} are in development mode. You cannot deploy a project with *Development Mode* turned on or with a manually added `SNAPSHOT` version suffix to a {KIE_SERVER} that is in production mode.
