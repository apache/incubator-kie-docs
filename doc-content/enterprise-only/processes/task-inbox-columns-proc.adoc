= Managing task list columns

In the task list on the *Task Inbox* and *Manage Tasks* windows, you can specify what columns to view and you can change the order of columns to better manage task information.

[NOTE]
====
Only users with the `process-admin` role can view the task list on the *Manage Tasks* page. Users with the `admin` role can access the *Manage Tasks* page, however they see only an empty task list.
