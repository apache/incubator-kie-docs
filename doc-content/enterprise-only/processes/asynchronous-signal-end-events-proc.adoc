= Configuring asynchronous signals for end events

End events indicate the completion of a business process. All end events, with the exception of the none and terminate end events, are throw events. A throwing signal end event is used to finish a process or subprocess flow. When the execution flow enters the element, the execution flow finishes and produces a signal identified by its `SignalRef` property.

You can configure an asynchronous signal for end events in {CENTRAL}.

.Prerequisites

* You have created a project in {CENTRAL} and it contains at least one business process asset.
* A project with a process definition has been deployed in {CENTRAL}.

.Procedure

. Open a business process asset.
. In the process designer canvas, drag and drop the *End Signal* from the left toolbar.
. In the upper-right corner, click image:getting-started/diagram_properties.png[] to open the *Properties* panel.
. Expand *Data Assignments*.
. Click the box under the *Assignments* sub-section. The *Task Data I/O* dialog box opens.
. Click *Add* next to *Data Inputs and Assignments*.
. Enter a name of the throw event as *async* in the *Name* field.
. Leave the *Data Type* and *Source* fields blank.
. Click *OK*.

It will automatically set the executor service on each session. This ensures that each process instance is signaled in a different transaction.
