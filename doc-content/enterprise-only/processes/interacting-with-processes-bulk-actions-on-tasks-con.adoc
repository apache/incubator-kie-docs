= Bulk actions on tasks

In the *Tasks* and *Task Inbox* pages in {CENTRAL}, you can perform bulk actions over multiple tasks in a single operation.

NOTE: If a specified bulk action is not permitted based on the task status, a notification is displayed and the operation is not executed on that particular task.
