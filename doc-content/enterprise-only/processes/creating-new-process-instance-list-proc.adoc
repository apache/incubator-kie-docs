= Creating a custom process instance list

You can view the list of all the running process instances in *Menu* -> *Manage* -> *Process Instances* in {CENTRAL}. From this page, you can manage the instances during run time and monitor their execution. You can customize which columns are displayed, the number of rows displayed per page, and filter the results. You can also create a custom process instance list.

.Prerequisites

.Procedure
. In {CENTRAL}, go to *Menu* -> *Manage* -> *Process Instances*.

. From the list of filter values, select the parameters and values to configure the custom process instance list, and click *Save*.

A new filter is created and immediately applied to the process instances list. The filter is also saved in the *Saved Filters* list. You can access saved filters by clicking the star icon on the left side of the *Manage Process Instances* page.
