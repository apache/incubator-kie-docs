= Filtering tasks using basic or advanced filters

{Central} provides built-in filters to help you search tasks. You can filter tasks by attributes such as *Status*, *Filter By*, *Process Definition Id*, and *Created On*. It is also possible to create custom task filters using the *Advanced Filters* option. The newly created custom filter is added to the *Saved Filters* pane, which is accessible by clicking on the star icon on the left of the *Task Inbox* page.
