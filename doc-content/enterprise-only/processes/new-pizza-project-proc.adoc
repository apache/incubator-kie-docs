= Creating the Pizza Place project

A project can contain data models, business processes, business rules, and forms that are specific to your project's requirements. When you create a project in {CENTRAL} it is added to the Git repository connected to {CENTRAL}.

For this project, you will create a simple business process and create and modify forms.

//[IMPORTANT]
//====
//The business process application example includes features that //are Technology Preview only. Technology Preview features are not //supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs), might not be functionally complete, and are not recommended for production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.
//For more information on Red Hat Technology Preview support, see https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/[Technology Preview Features Support Scope].
