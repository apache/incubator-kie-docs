= Creating users
You can create as many {CENTRAL} users as you require. User privileges and settings are controlled by the roles assigned to a user and the groups that a user belongs to. For this example, you must create two new users: `Katy` who will act as the pizza place employee, and `Bill` who will act as the customer placing the order. For more information on creating users, see the *Creating users* chapter of {URL_INSTALLING_ON_EAP}[_{INSTALLING_ON_EAP}_].
