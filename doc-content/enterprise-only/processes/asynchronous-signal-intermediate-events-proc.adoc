= Configuring asynchronous signals for intermediate events

Intermediate events drive the flow of a business process. Intermediate events are used to either catch or throw an event during the execution of the business process. An intermediate event handles a particular situation that occurs during process execution. A throwing signal intermediate event produces a signal object based on the defined properties.

You can configure an asynchronous signal for intermediate events in {CENTRAL}.

.Prerequisites

* You have created a project in {CENTRAL} and it contains at least one business process asset.
* A project with a process definition has been deployed in {CENTRAL}.

.Procedure

. Open a business process asset.
. In the process designer canvas, drag and drop the *Intermediate Signal* from the left toolbar.
. Click the *Properties* icon on the upper-right side of the screen to open the *Properties* panel.
. Expand the *Data Assignments* section.
. Click the box under the *Assignments* sub-section. The *Task Data I/O* dialog box opens.
. Click *Add* next to *Data Inputs and Assignments*.
. Enter a name of the throw event as *async* in the *Name* field.
. Leave the *Data Type* and *Source* fields blank.
. Click *OK*.

It will automatically set the executor service on each session. This ensures that each process instance is signaled in a different transaction.
