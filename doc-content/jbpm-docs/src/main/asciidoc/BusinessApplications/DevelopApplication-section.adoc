= Develop your business application

Developing custom logic in business application strictly depends on your specific requirements. In this this guide
we will provide some common steps that developers might need to get started.

== Data model

The data model project in your generated business application promotes
the idea (and best practice in fact) of designing data models with reuse in mind. At the same time
it avoids putting too much in the model (which usually happens when model is colocated with the service itself).

Data model project should be seen as the API of the business application or one of the service. In case of
application that is composed of several services it's recommended that each service exposes its own
data model (API).

That API then can be used by both service project and the business assets project.

NOTE: Generated application model is not added as dependency to service nor business assets projects.

== Business assets development

Business assets are usually developed in {CENTRAL}, where developers can create
different assets types such as

* Business processes
* Case definitions
* Rules
* Decision tables
* Data objects
* Forms
* Others

Before these assets can be created the business assets project needs to be imported into {CENTRAL}
as described in <<BusinessApplications/RunApplication-section.adoc#_import_your_business_assets_project_into_jbpm_console,Import your business assets project into {CENTRAL}>>

Whenever working with business assets you can easily try them out in your business application by
running the application in development mode. That allows developer to build and deploy the assets
project directly to a running application.
Moreover {CENTRAL} can also be used to quickly interact with processes, tasks and cases. To learn more
see  <<BusinessApplications/RunApplication-section.adoc#_launch_application_in_development_mode,Launch application in development mode>>

Once the work on business assets is finished it should be fetch back to your business application source.

* go into business assets project - _{your business application name}-kjar_
* execute `git fetch origin`
* execute `git rebase origin/master`

With this your business assets are now part of the business application source tree and
can be launched in standalone mode - without {CENTRAL} as {CONTROLLER}.

To launch your application just go into service project (_{your business application name}-service_)
and invoke

`./launch.sh clean install` for Linux/Unix

`./launch.bat clean install` for Windows

NOTE: In case the version of your business assets project changes you will have to update that information
in the service project. Locate the configuration file that is used for standalone mode _{your business application name}-service.xml_
Edit it and update the version for the specific container.

Business assets project has two special files

* pom.xml
* src/main/resources/META-INF/kie-deployment-descriptor.xml

The first one is Apache Maven project file and is managed via _Project Settings_ in {CENTRAL}.
It allows to define project information (group id, artifact id, version, name, description). In
addition it allows to define dependencies the project will have e.g. data model project.

[NOTE]
===================
Whenever dependencies are added from the following group ids they should be marked as scope provided

* org.kie
* org.drools
* org.jbpm
* org.optaplanner

===================

Deployment descriptor allows to configure various components of the business automation capability
such as

* Persistence for jBPM
* Runtime strategy
* Event listeners
* Work item handlers
* Marshalling strategies
* And more

for complete description of the deployment descriptor see
<<RuntimeManagement-chapter.adoc#_deployment_descriptors,Deployment descriptor>>

== Work Item Handlers

Business processes can take advantage of so called domain specific services which are implemented
as work items and their actual execution is carried out by work item handlers. Work items defined
in the process or case definition are linked by name with work item handler (the implementation).

Work item handlers can be registered in three ways

* via *deployment descriptor* - use this approach if you want to decouple life cycle of the
handler from your business application
* via *auto registration of Spring Components* - use this when you have your handlers implemented
as Spring beans (components) that are bound to the life cycle of the application
* via *manual registration of any work handler implementation* - use this when the handler is not
implemented by you and thus there is no way to use the Spring Component approach or it has advanced
initialisation logic that does not fit the deployment descriptor approach


=== Register Work Item Handler via deployment descriptor

Registration in deployment descriptor can be done directly in {CENTRAL} via
Project settings -> Deployments

Add the work item handler mapped to the name of the work item

this will result in following source code of the deployment descriptor

[source, xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<deployment-descriptor xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.jboss.org/jbpm deployment-descriptor.xsd" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">

=== Register Work Item Handler via auto registration of Spring Components

The easiest way to register work item handlers is to rely on Spring discovery and configuration
of beans. It's enough to annotate your work item handler class with `@Component("WorkItemName")`
and that bean will be automatically registered in jBPM.

[source, java]
----
import org.kie.api.runtime.process.WorkItem;
import org.kie.api.runtime.process.WorkItemHandler;
import org.kie.api.runtime.process.WorkItemManager;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component("Custom")
public class CustomWorkItemHandler implements WorkItemHandler {

    @Override
    public void executeWorkItem(WorkItem workItem, WorkItemManager manager) {

        manager.completeWorkItem(workItem.getId(), null);
    }

    @Override
    public void abortWorkItem(WorkItem workItem, WorkItemManager manager) {

    }

}
----

This will register CustomWorkItemHandler under `Custom` name so every work item named `Custom`
will use that handler to execute it's logic.

NOTE: The name attribute of `@Component` annotations is mandatory for registration to happen.
In case the name is missing work item handler won't be registered and warning will be logged.

=== Register Work Item Handler programmatically

Last resort option is to get hold of DeploymentService and register handlers programatically

[source, java]
----


@Autowire
private SpringKModuleDeploymentService deploymentService;

...

@PostConstruct
public void configure() {

    deploymentService.registerWorkItemHandler("Custom", new CustomWorkItemHandler());
}

----


== Event listeners

jBPM allows to register various event listeners that will be invoked upon various events
triggered by the {PROCESS_ENGINE}. Supported event listener types are

* ProcessEventListener
* AgendaEventListener
* RuleRuntimeEventListener
* TaskLifeCycleEventListener
* CaseEventListener

Similar to work item handlers, event listeners can be registered in three ways

* via *deployment descriptor* - use this approach if you want to decouple life cycle of the
listener from your business application
* via *auto registration of Spring Components* - use this when you have your listeners implemented
as Spring beans (components) that are bound to the life cycle of the application
* via *manual registration of any work handler implementation* - use this when the listener is not
implemented by you and thus there is no way to use the Spring Component approach or it has advanced
initialisation logic that does not fit the deployment descriptor approach

=== Register event listener via deployment descriptor

Registration in deployment descriptor can be done directly in {CENTRAL} via
Project settings -> Deployments

=== Register event listener via auto registration of Spring Components

The easiest way to register event listeners is to rely on Spring discovery and configuration
of beans. It's enough to annotate your event listener implementation class with `@Component()`
and that bean will be automatically registered in jBPM.

[source, java]
----
import org.kie.api.event.process.ProcessCompletedEvent;
import org.kie.api.event.process.ProcessEventListener;
import org.kie.api.event.process.ProcessNodeLeftEvent;
import org.kie.api.event.process.ProcessNodeTriggeredEvent;
import org.kie.api.event.process.ProcessStartedEvent;
import org.kie.api.event.process.ProcessVariableChangedEvent;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class CustomProcessEventListener implements ProcessEventListener {

    @Override
    public void beforeProcessStarted(ProcessStartedEvent event) {

    }

    ...

}
----

TIP: Event listener can extend _default_ implementation of given event listener to avoid
implementing all methods e.g. `org.kie.api.event.process.DefaultProcessEventListener`

Type of the event listeners is determined by the interface (or super class) it implements.

=== Register event listener programmatically

Last resort option is to get hold of DeploymentService and register handlers programatically

[source, java]
----
@Autowire
private SpringKModuleDeploymentService deploymentService;

...

@PostConstruct
public void configure() {

    deploymentService.registerProcessEventListener(new CustomProcessEventListener());
}

----

== Custom REST endpoints

In many (if not all) cases there will be a need to expose additional REST endpoints for your
business application (in your service project). This can be easily achieved by creating a JAX-RS
compatible class (with JAX-RS annotations). It will automatically be registered with the running
service when the following scanning option is configured in your apps application.properties config file:

[source, bash]
----
cxf.jaxrs.classes-scan=true
cxf.jaxrs.classes-scan-packages=org.kie.server.springboot.samples.rest
----

The endpoint will be bound to the global REST api path defined in the `cxf.path` property.

An example of a custom endpoint can be found below

[source, java]
----
package org.kie.server.springboot.samples.rest;

import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.Produces;
import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;
import javax.ws.rs.core.Response;

@Path("extra")
public class AdditionalEndpoint {

    @GET
    @Produces({MediaType.APPLICATION_XML, MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON})
    public Response listContainers() {

        return Response.ok().build();
    }
}
