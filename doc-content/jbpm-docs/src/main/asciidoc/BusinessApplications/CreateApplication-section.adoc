= Create your business application

Business application can be created in multiple ways, depending on the project types you need.

== Generate business application

The fastest and recommended way to quickly generate your business application is by using the jBPM online service: https://start.jbpm.org[start.jbpm.org]

With the online service you can:

* generate your business app using a default (most commonly used) configuration
* configure your business application to include specific features that you need

The generated application will be delivered as a zip archive will following structure

To provide more information about individual steps, let's review different options
that user can choose from

=== Capabilities

Capabilities essentially define the features that your business application will be
equipped with. Available options are:

* *Business automation*
covers features for process management, case management, decision
management and optimisation. These will be by default configured in the service project
of your business application. Although you can turn them off via configuration.
* *Decision management*
covers mainly decision and rules related features (backed by Drools project)
* *Business optimisation*
covers planning problems and solutions related features (backed by OptaPlanner project)

=== Application information

General information about the application that is

* name - the name that will be used for the projects generated
* package - valid Java package name that will be created in the projects and used as group of maven projects
* version - selected version of jBPM/KIE that should be used for service project

=== Project types

Selection of project types to be included in the business application

* data model - basic maven/jar project to keep the data structures
* business assets - kjar project that can be easily imported into {CENTRAL} for development
* service - service project that will include chosen capabilities with all bits configured


== Manually create business application

In case you can't use jBPM online service to generate the application you can manually
create individual projects. jBPM provides maven archetypes that can be easily used
to generate the application. In fact jBPM online service uses these archetypes behind the
scenes to generate business application.

Business assets project archetype

`org.kie:kie-kjar-archetype:{COMMUNITY_VERSION_FINAL}`

Service project archetype

`org.kie:kie-service-spring-boot-archetype:{COMMUNITY_VERSION_FINAL}`

Data model archetype

`org.apache.maven.archetypes:maven-archetype-quickstart:1.3`

Example that allows to generate all three types of projects

[source, bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
mvn archetype:generate -B -DarchetypeGroupId=org.kie -DarchetypeArtifactId=kie-model-archetype -DarchetypeVersion={COMMUNITY_VERSION_FINAL} -DgroupId=com.company -DartifactId=test-model -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT -Dpackage=com.company.model

mvn archetype:generate -B -DarchetypeGroupId=org.kie -DarchetypeArtifactId=kie-kjar-archetype -DarchetypeVersion={COMMUNITY_VERSION_FINAL} -DgroupId=com.company -DartifactId=test-kjar -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT -Dpackage=com.company

mvn archetype:generate -B -DarchetypeGroupId=org.kie -DarchetypeArtifactId=kie-service-spring-boot-archetype -DarchetypeVersion={COMMUNITY_VERSION_FINAL} -DgroupId=com.company -DartifactId=test-service -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT -Dpackage=com.company.service -DappType=bpm
----

When generating projects from the archetypes in same directory you should end up with exactly the same structure as generated by jBPM online service.
