= Deploy business application

Business applications are designed to run in pretty much any environment but for production
the usual target is cloud based runtimes that allow scalability and operational efficiency.

Business application deployable components are composed of services. Every application can consists of
one or more services that are deployed in isolation and in many cases will follow different release cycle.

== OpenShift deployment

Business applications can be easily deployed to OpenShift Container Platform. It's as easy as starting
the application locally, meaning by using launch.sh/bat scripts.

NOTE: You need to have OpenShift installed (good choice for local installation is minishift) or remote installation
that can be accessed over network.

So first of all login to OpenShift Cluster

[source, bash]
----
oc login -u system:admin
----

once successfully logged in following output (or similar) should be displayed

[source, bash]
----
Logged into "https://192.168.64.2:8443" as "system:admin" using existing credentials.

You have access to the following projects and can switch between them with 'oc project <projectname>':

    default
    kube-public
    kube-system
  * myproject
    openshift
    openshift-infra
    openshift-node
    openshift-web-console

Using project "myproject".
----

To deploy your application as to OpenShift Container Platform just go into service
project (_{your business application name}-service_) and invoke

`./launch.sh clean install -Popenshift,h2` for Linux/Unix

`./launch.bat clean install -Popenshift,h2` for Windows

The launch script will perform the build with openshift profile (see pom.xml in the business assets project
and service project for details). The significant difference that is done for openshift
is that the business assets project will generate an offline maven repository with the project itself and
all its dependencies. Next this maven repository will be included in the image itself and maven
(used by business automation capability) will work in offline mode - meaning no access to internet will
be attempted.

[source, bash]
----
Launching the application on OpenShift...
--> Found image ef440f7 (15 seconds old) in image stream "myproject/business-application-service" under tag "1.0-SNAPSHOT" for "business-application-service:1.0-SNAPSHOT"

    * This image will be deployed in deployment config "business-application-service"
    * Ports 8090/tcp, 8778/tcp, 9779/tcp will be load balanced by service "business-application-service"
      * Other containers can access this service through the hostname "business-application-service"

--> Creating resources ...
    deploymentconfig "business-application-service" created
    service "business-application-service" created
--> Success
    Application is not exposed. You can expose services to the outside world by executing one or more of the commands below:
     'oc expose svc/business-application-service'
    Run 'oc status' to view your app.
route "business-application-service" exposed
----

You can then go to OpenShift Web Console and look at the Overview of your project (myproject by default)

image::BusinessApplications/business-app-openshift-overview.png[Business application on OpenShift]

By clicking on the route url (in this case `http://business-application-service-myproject.192.168.64.2.nip.io`)
you can go to the application already deployed and running.

== Docker deployment

Business applications are by default configured with option to deploy service as docker container.

This is done in very similar way as launching the service locally - via launch.sh/bat script.

NOTE: You must have Docker installed on your machine to make this work!

To deploy your application as docker container just go into service project (_{your business application name}-service_)
and invoke

`./launch.sh clean install -Pdocker,h2` for Linux/Unix

`./launch.bat clean install -Pdocker,h2` for Windows

NOTE: When building with docker proper data base profile needs to be selected as well - this is done via -Pdocker,{db}
so the image and the application gets proper JDBC driver selected.

The launch script will perform the build with docker profile (see pom.xml in the business assets project
and service project for details). The significant difference that is done for docker container
is that the business assets project will generate an offline maven repository with the project itself and
all its dependencies. Next this maven repository will be included in the docker image itself and maven
(used by business automation capability) will work in offline mode - meaning no access to internet will
be attempted.

Once the build is complete launch script will directly create container and start it, this should be done once
the following line is printed to console

[source, bash]
----
Launching the application as docker container...
d40e4cdb662d3b1d9ddee27c5a843be31cb6e7dc4936b0fc1937ce8e48f440ae
----

the second line is the container id that can be later on used to interact with the container, for instance
to follow the logs

[source, bash]
----
docker logs -f d40e4cdb662d3b1d9ddee27c5a843be31cb6e7dc4936b0fc1937ce8e48f440ae
----

the business application will be accessible at the same port as configured by default that is 8090, simply
go to http://localhost:8090[http://localhost:8090] to see your application running as docker container.

== Using external data base

Currently business application that requires external data base needs to provide the data base in advance -
before the application is launched and properly configured within the application configuration files.

Further releases will improve this by relying on docker compose/OpenShift templates.
