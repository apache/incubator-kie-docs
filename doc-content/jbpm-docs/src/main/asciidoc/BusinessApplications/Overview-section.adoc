= Overview

Business application can be defined as an automated solution, built with selected frameworks and capabilities that implements business
functions and/or business problems. Capabilities can be (among others):

* persistence
* messaging
* transactions
* business processes, business rules
* planning solutions

Business application is more of a logical grouping of individual services that represent certain business capabilities.
Usually they are deployed separately and can also be versioned individually. Overall goal is that the complete business
application will allow particular domain to achieve their business goals e.g. order management, accommodation management, etc.

.Business application is

* Build on any runtime (most popular options)
** SpringBoot
** WildFly
** Quarkus

* deployable to cloud with just single command
** OpenShift
** Kubernetes
** Docker

* UI agnostic
** Doesn’t enforce any UI frameworks and let users to make their own choice

* Configurable database profiles
** to allow smooth transition from one database to another with just single parameter/switch

* Generated
** makes it really easy to start for developers so they don’t get upset with initial failures usually related to configuration


.Business application consists of

* Many project
** data model project - shared data model between business assets and service
** business assets (kjar) project - easily importable into {CENTRAL}
** service project - actual service with various capabilities

* Configuration for
** maven repository - settings.xml
** database profiles
** deployment setup
*** local
*** docker
*** OpenShift

Service project is the one that is deployable but will in most of the cases include business assets and data model projects.
Data model project represents the common data structures that will be shared between service implementation and
business assets. That enables proper encapsulation and promotes reuse and at the same time reduces shortcuts to make
data model classes something more than they are - include too much of implementation into data models.

Business applications you build are not restricted to having only one of each project types. In order to build the solutions you need your business app can:

* Have multiple data model projects - each service project can expose its own public data model
* Have multiple business assets (kjar) projects - in case there is a business need for it
* Have multiple service projects - to split services into smaller components for better manageability
* Have UI modules - either per service (embedded in the service project) or a federated one (separate project for UI only)
* Service projects can communicate with each other either directly or via business processes
