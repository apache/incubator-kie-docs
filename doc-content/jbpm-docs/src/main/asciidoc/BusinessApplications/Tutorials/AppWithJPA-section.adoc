= Business Application with JPA entity

== What will you do

You will enhance your business application with JPA entity that will be used both by
your business application service and business assets.

* develop JPA entity as part of your business-application-model project
* business process (BPMN2) with user task that will display JPA entity

and execute this business assets

* via REST api of your business application
* via {CENTRAL} UI

== What do you need

* About 20 minutes of your time
* Java (JDK) 8 or later
* Maven 3.5.x
* IDE of your choice
* Access to the Internet
* {CENTRAL} deployed - see single distribution for instructions

== What should I do

If you haven't done it already, complete tutorial `Business Application with Business Assets`.

NOTE: If you would like directly start with this tutorial you can get
complete source of the `Business Application with Business Assets` tutorial from
https://github.com/business-applications/02-tutorial-business-assets-application[here]

Start {CENTRAL} (if not already started) and open your browser at
http://localhost:8080/jbpm-console[http://localhost:8080/jbpm-console] and logon as
user `wbadmin` with password `wbadmin`

=== Import your business assets project into {CENTRAL}

if not already imported proceed with points below to import business asset project

* Go into business assets project - `business-application-kjar`
* Execute `git init`
* Execute `git add -A`
* Execute `git commit -m "my business assets project"`
* Log in to {CENTRAL} and go to projects
* Select import project and enter the following URL `file:///{path to your business application}/business-application-kjar`
* Click import and confirm project to be imported


=== Implement JPA entity

* Import business-application-model project into IDE of your choice
* Add to pom.xml of the model project dependency to JPA api (in scope provided)

[source, xml]
----
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.hibernate.javax.persistence</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-jpa-2.1-api</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0.Final</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

* Implement class as JPA Entity `Person`
* Create three fields in the class
** id (of type Long)
** firstName (of type String)
** lastName (of type String)
* Annotate the class with `@Entity`
* Annotate the `id` field with `@Id` and `@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)`

Complete class of the entity should look like this

[source, java]
----
package com.company.model;

import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.GeneratedValue;
import javax.persistence.GenerationType;
import javax.persistence.Id;

@Entity
public class Person {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
    private Long id;

    private String firstName;

    private String lastName;

    public Long getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public void setId(Long id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    public String getFirstName() {
        return firstName;
    }

    public void setFirstName(String firstName) {
        this.firstName = firstName;
    }

    public String getLastName() {
        return lastName;
    }

    public void setLastName(String lastName) {
        this.lastName = lastName;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Person [id=" + id + ", firstName=" + firstName + ", lastName=" + lastName + "]";
    }

}
----

=== Configure service project to use the JPA entity

* Import business-application-service project into IDE of your choice
* Add dependency to the business-application-model in your service pom.xml

[source, xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.company</groupId>
  <artifactId>business-application-model</artifactId>
  <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
----

* Edit application.properties file (that is located in src/main/resources)
* Add `spring.jpa.properties.entity-scan-packages=com.company.model` into the file

NOTE: Adjust the package if you did not use the default com.company.model package

* Add the same entry into `application-dev.properties` file

=== Create new process that use JPA entity

* Log in to {CENTRAL}
* Go to Projects -> business-application-kjar project
* Go to Settings tab
* Go to Dependencies
* Add dependency to business-application-model - make sure it is in provided scope
* Go to Deployment -> Marshalling strategy
* Add new marshalling strategy with following value `new org.drools.persistence.jpa.marshaller.JPAPlaceholderResolverStrategy(entityManagerFactory)`
* Go back to assets
* Click Add Asset button and select Business Process
* Give it a name `JPAProcess`
* Open `Tasks` on the palette
* Drag and Drop the User Task into the canvas
* Connect it with start event and finish it with end event
* Create variable named person with type (custom) `com.company.model.Person`

It should look like this

image::BusinessApplications/tutorial-4-process-with-jpa-user-task.png[]

* Map the variable as input and output of user task - use same name for input and output variable

image::BusinessApplications/tutorial-4-process-with-jpa-user-task-vars.png[]

* Save and close the editor


=== Run the application

At this point all development effort is done, the last remaining thing is to pull
back the business assets project into the business-application-kjar project

* Go to business-application-kjar
* Execute `git remote add origin ssh://wbadmin@localhost:8001/MySpace/business-application-kjar` (if not already added)
* Execute `git pull origin master` - when prompted enter `wbadmin` as password

Go to `business-application-service` directory and launch the application

`./launch.sh clean install` for Linux/Unix

`./launch.bat clean install` for Windows

== Results

Once the build and launch is complete you can open your browser
http://localhost:8090[http://localhost:8090]

Next, point the browser to http://localhost:8090/rest/server/containers[http://localhost:8090/rest/server/containers]
to see that your business assets project has been properly deployed and is running.

NOTE: By default all REST endpoints (url pattern /rest/*) are secured and require
authentication. Default user that can be used to logon is `wbadmin` with password `wbadmin`

Next, point the browser to http://localhost:8090/rest/server/containers/business-application-kjar/processes[http://localhost:8090/rest/server/containers/business-application-kjar/processes]
to see business processes available for execution. You should see two of them.

=== Execute business process

You can execute business process via REST api exposed by your business application (in fact by Business Automation capability).

URL: `http://localhost:8090/rest/server/containers/business-application-kjar/processes/{processid}/instances`

HTTP method: POST

HTTP headers:

* Accept: application/json
* Content-Type: application/json

Body:

[source, json]
----
{
  "person" : {
    "Person" : {
      "firstName":"WB",
      "lastName":"Admin"
    }
  }
}
----

{processid} needs to be replaced with actual process id that is returned from the endpoint http://localhost:8090/rest/server/containers/business-application-kjar/processes

NOTE: Remember that endpoints are protected so make sure you provide username and password when making the request.

In response to this request, a process instance id should be returned.

[source, xml]
----
1
----

You can examine details of that process instance by pointing your browser to
http://localhost:8090/rest/server/containers/business-application-kjar/processes/instances/1?withVars=true[http://localhost:8090/rest/server/containers/business-application-kjar/processes/instances/1?withVars=true]

This illustrates that an instance has been created, it has one user task assigned
(the owner is wbadmin) and it has two process variables

* initiator - set to the user who initiated the request
* person - our JPA entity that was created based on the payload - but note that the id
was generated automatically by the database

You can also examine user task by opening following URL in your browser
http://localhost:8090/rest/server/containers/business-application-kjar/tasks/1?withInputData=true[http://localhost:8090/rest/server/containers/business-application-kjar/tasks/1?withInputData=true]

Same person JPA entity is available on the task assigned to wbadmin

== Summary

Congratulations! you have enhanced your business application to take advantage of a JPA entity
as shared model between your business assets and service projects.
With the power of business automation and JPA you learned how to externalise data managed by
automated by business processes.
