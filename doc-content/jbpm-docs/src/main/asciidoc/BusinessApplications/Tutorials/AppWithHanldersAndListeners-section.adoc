= Business Application with custom work item handlers and event listeners

== What will you do

You will enhance your business application with business assets that execute custom
business logic and monitors execution via event listeners.

* business process (BPMN2) with custom service task (aka work item)
* develop work item handler for the custom service task
* develop process event listener that will receive events from the {PROCESS_ENGINE}

and execute this business assets

* via REST api of your business application
* via {CENTRAL} UI

== What do you need

* About 20 minutes of your time
* Java (JDK) 8 or later
* Maven 3.5.x
* IDE of your choice
* Access to the Internet
* {CENTRAL} deployed - see single distribution for instructions

== What should I do

If you haven't done it already, complete tutorial `Business Application with Business Assets`.

NOTE: If you would like directly start with this tutorial you can get
complete source of the `Business Application with Business Assets` tutorial from
https://github.com/business-applications/02-tutorial-business-assets-application[here]

Start {CENTRAL} (if not already started) and open your browser at
http://localhost:8080/business-central[http://localhost:8080/business-central] and logon as
user `wbadmin` with password `wbadmin`

=== Import your business assets project into {CENTRAL}

if not already imported proceed with points below to import business asset project

* Go into business assets project - `business-application-kjar`
* Execute `git init`
* Execute `git add -A`
* Execute `git commit -m "my business assets project"`
* Log in to {CENTRAL} and go to projects
* Select import project and enter the following URL `file:///{path to your business application}/business-application-kjar`
* Click import and confirm project to be imported

=== Create custom service task in {CENTRAL}

* Go to Projects -> business-application-kjar project
* Click Add asset and select WorkItem Definition
* Give it a name `CustomTask`

It should look like the following snippet

[source, plain]
----
[
  [
    "name" : "MyTask",
    "parameters" : [
        "MyFirstParam" : new StringDataType(),
        "MySecondParam" : new StringDataType(),
        "MyThirdParam" : new ObjectDataType()
    ],
    "results" : [
        "Result" : new ObjectDataType("java.util.Map")
    ],
    "displayName" : "My Task",
    "icon" : ""
  ]
]
----

* Save and close the editor

=== Create new process with service task (`MyTask`)

* Click Add Asset button and select Business Process
* Give it a name `CustomTaskProcess`
* Open `Service Tasks` on the palette (cogs icon)
* Drag and Drop the MyTask service task into the canvas
* Connect it with start event and finish it with end event

It should look like this

* Save and close the editor

=== Implement custom work item handler

* Import business-application-service project into IDE of your choice
* Create new class MyTaskWorkItemHandler that implements `org.kie.api.runtime.process.WorkItemHandler`
* Implement the `executeWorkItemHandler` by simply printing out work item and complete the work item

[source, java]
----
@Override
public void executeWorkItem(WorkItem workItem, WorkItemManager manager) {
    System.out.println("Work item being executed " + workItem);
    manager.completeWorkItem(workItem.getId(), null);
}
----

* annotate the class with `@Component` annotation with name that matches the work item
defined in {CENTRAL}

Complete class of the handler should look like this

[source, java]
----
package com.company.service.handlers;

import org.kie.api.runtime.process.WorkItem;
import org.kie.api.runtime.process.WorkItemHandler;
import org.kie.api.runtime.process.WorkItemManager;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component("MyTask")
public class MyTaskWorkItemHandler implements WorkItemHandler {

    @Override
    public void executeWorkItem(WorkItem workItem, WorkItemManager manager) {
        System.out.println("Work item being executed " + workItem);
        manager.completeWorkItem(workItem.getId(), null);
    }

    @Override
    public void abortWorkItem(WorkItem workItem, WorkItemManager manager) {

    }

}
----

=== Implement custom event listener

To be able to monitor execution of our business assets such as business process
an event listener can be implemented. In this tutorial we focus on ProcessEventListener
but there are other types such as:

* TaskLifeCycleEventListener
* CaseEventListener
* RuleRuntimeEventListener
* AgendaEventListener

Go back to IDE where the business-application-service is imported

* Create class MyProcessEventListener that implements `org.kie.api.event.process.ProcessEventListener`
* Implement methods with simple print outs
* Annotate the class with `Component` - in this case the name is not relevant

Complete class of the event listener should look like this

[source, java]
----
package com.company.service.listeners;

import org.kie.api.event.process.ProcessCompletedEvent;
import org.kie.api.event.process.ProcessEventListener;
import org.kie.api.event.process.ProcessNodeLeftEvent;
import org.kie.api.event.process.ProcessNodeTriggeredEvent;
import org.kie.api.event.process.ProcessStartedEvent;
import org.kie.api.event.process.ProcessVariableChangedEvent;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class MyProcessEventListener implements ProcessEventListener {

    @Override
    public void beforeProcessStarted(ProcessStartedEvent event) {
        System.out.println("beforeProcessStarted " + event);
    }

    @Override
    public void afterProcessStarted(ProcessStartedEvent event) {
        System.out.println("afterProcessStarted " + event);
    }

    @Override
    public void beforeProcessCompleted(ProcessCompletedEvent event) {
        System.out.println("beforeProcessCompleted " + event);
    }

    @Override
    public void afterProcessCompleted(ProcessCompletedEvent event) {
        System.out.println("afterProcessCompleted " + event);
    }

    @Override
    public void beforeNodeTriggered(ProcessNodeTriggeredEvent event) {
        System.out.println("beforeNodeTriggered " + event);
    }

    @Override
    public void afterNodeTriggered(ProcessNodeTriggeredEvent event) {
        System.out.println("afterNodeTriggered " + event);
    }

    @Override
    public void beforeNodeLeft(ProcessNodeLeftEvent event) {
        System.out.println("beforeNodeLeft " + event);
    }

    @Override
    public void afterNodeLeft(ProcessNodeLeftEvent event) {
        System.out.println("afterNodeLeft " + event);
    }

    @Override
    public void beforeVariableChanged(ProcessVariableChangedEvent event) {
        System.out.println("beforeVariableChanged " + event);
    }

    @Override
    public void afterVariableChanged(ProcessVariableChangedEvent event) {
        System.out.println("afterVariableChanged " + event);
    }

}
----

=== Run the application

At this point all development effort is done, the last remaining thing is to pull
back the business assets project into the business-application-kjar project

* Go to business-application-kjar
* Execute `git remote add origin ssh://wbadmin@localhost:8001/MySpace/business-application-kjar` (if not already added)
* Execute `git pull origin master` - when prompted enter `wbadmin` as password

Go to `business-application-service` directory and launch the application

`./launch.sh clean install` for Linux/Unix

`./launch.bat clean install` for Windows

== Results

Once the build and launch is complete you can open your browser
http://localhost:8090[http://localhost:8090]

Next, point the browser to http://localhost:8090/rest/server/containers[http://localhost:8090/rest/server/containers]
to see that your business assets project has been properly deployed and is running.

NOTE: By default all REST endpoints (url pattern /rest/*) are secured and require
authentication. Default user that can be used to logon is `wbadmin` with password `wbadmin`

Next, point the browser to http://localhost:8090/rest/server/containers/business-application-kjar/processes[http://localhost:8090/rest/server/containers/business-application-kjar/processes]
to see business processes available for execution. You should see two of them.

=== Execute business process

You can execute business process via REST api exposed by your business application (in fact by Business Automation capability).

URL: `http://localhost:8090/rest/server/containers/business-application-kjar/processes/{processid}/instances`
HTTP method: POST

Optionally HTTP headers can be set to change the format of data returned

* Accept: application/json for JSON format
* Accept: application/xml for XML (JAXB based) format
* X-KIE-ContentType: XSTREAM for XML (XStream based) format

{processid} needs to be replaced with actual process id that is returned from the endpoint http://localhost:8090/rest/server/containers/business-application-kjar/processes

NOTE: Remember that endpoints are protected so make sure you provide user name and password when making the request.

In response to this request, a process instance id should be returned.

[source, xml]
----
<long-type>
    <value>1</value>
</long-type>
----

You can examine details of that process instance by pointing your browser to
http://localhost:8090/rest/server/containers/business-application-kjar/processes/instances/1[http://localhost:8090/rest/server/containers/business-application-kjar/processes/instances/1]

[source, xml]
----
<process-instance>
  <process-instance-id>1</process-instance-id>
  <process-id>business-application-kjar.CustomTaskProcess</process-id>
  <process-name>CustomTaskProcess</process-name>
  <process-version>1.0</process-version>
  <process-instance-state>2</process-instance-state>
  <container-id>business-application-kjar-1_0-SNAPSHOT</container-id>
  <initiator>wbadmin</initiator>
  <start-date>2018-10-11T13:29:55.807+02:00</start-date>
  <process-instance-desc>CustomTaskProcess</process-instance-desc>
  <correlation-key>1</correlation-key>
  <parent-instance-id>-1</parent-instance-id>
  <sla-compliance>0</sla-compliance>
</process-instance>
----

Looking into the application logs (console) you should see that both the handler has
been executed and event listener was notified about various events

=== Execute business process from {CENTRAL} UI

Follow the same procedure as described in
 <<BusinessApplications/Tutorials/AppWithProcesses-section.adoc#_execute_business_process_from_jbpm_console_ui,Execute business process from {CENTRAL} UI>>

== Summary

Congratulations! you have enhanced your business application to take advantage of custom service tasks
and you learned how to keep an eye on what is actually being executed by your business
application. With this knowledge you can start doing more advanced service tasks that will
integrate your application with the outside world.
