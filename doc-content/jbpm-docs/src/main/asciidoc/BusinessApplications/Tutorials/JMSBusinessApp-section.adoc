= Business Application with JMS

== What will you do

You will build business application that uses JMS to send information between your
business processes. It combines process logic and messaging to provide comprehensive
solution to common problems such as - how to notify other participants of particular
event.

== What do you need

* About 20 minutes of your time
* Java (JDK) 8 or later
* Maven 3.5.x
* IDE of your choice
* Access to the Internet
* {CENTRAL} deployed - see single distribution for instructions

== What should I do

=== Install Apache Artemis

https://activemq.apache.org/artemis/download.html[Download] and unzip Apache Artemis distribution.
Refer to the location where you unzip it as `${ARTEMIS_HOME}`.

Once downloaded, navigate to the location where you want to store your broker data and create new broker

[source, bash]
----
${ARTEMIS_HOME}/bin/artemis create business-app-broker
----

You will be prompted for some required information during creation, that should look like this

[source, bash]
----
Creating ActiveMQ Artemis instance at: /.../business-app-broker

--user: is a mandatory property!
Please provide the default username:
admin

--password: is mandatory with this configuration:
Please provide the default password:


--allow-anonymous | --require-login: is a mandatory property!
Allow anonymous access?, valid values are Y,N,True,False
Y
----

Next, start the broker instance, go to business-app-broker/bin and issue following command

[source, bash]
----
./artemis run
----

Open your browser at http://localhost:8161/console[http://localhost:8161/console] to logon to
management console of Apache Artemis with user name and password provided at the time you created the broker.

NOTE: For more detailed instruction on how to configure Apache Artemis https://activemq.apache.org/artemis/docs/latest/using-server.html[visit its website]

Last step in configuring JMS service is to create a queue (or an address as it's called in Apache Artemis).

Once logged into Management Console

* Go to Artemis in the menu
* Expand the tree view and click `addresses`
* On right hand side click `Create`
* Create new address with name `ExternalSignalQueue`
* Select `Anycast`

All steps are done for installing and configuring Apache Artemis for this tutorial.

=== Build business application

To get started with business applications the easiest way is to generate it.
Go to https://start.jbpm.org[start.jbpm.org] and click button
`Generate default business application`.

This will generate and download a `business-application.zip` file that will consists of
three projects

* business-application-model
* business-application-kjar
* business-application-service

Unzip the `business-application.zip` file into desired location and go into
`business-application-service` directory. There you will find launch scripts
(for both linux/unix and windows).

Start {CENTRAL} (if not already started) and open your browser at
http://localhost:8080/jbpm-console[http://localhost:8080/jbpm-console] and logon as
user `wbadmin` with password `wbadmin`

=== Import your business assets project into {CENTRAL}

if not already imported proceed with points below to import business asset project

* Go into business assets project - `business-application-kjar`
* Execute `git init`
* Execute `git add -A`
* Execute `git commit -m "my business assets project"`
* Log in to {CENTRAL} and go to projects
* Select import project and enter the following URL `file:///{path to your business application}/business-application-kjar`
* Click import and confirm project to be imported

=== Create Business Processes

In browser where you logged into {CENTRAL} go to Projects. You will see your newly imported
project named business-application-kjar, go into that project.

* go into business-application-kjar project
* click `Add asset` button
* select Business Process asset
* provide name for this asset (`throwsignalprocess`)
* create your business process

Sample business process should be a single script task and end signal event. Signal event
should use external scope and define a signal `IamDone`

image::BusinessApplications/tutorial-6-throw-process-event.png[Business process - sample]

Process should define single process variable `input` that is then mapped as data output of the end event.

image::BusinessApplications/tutorial-6-throw-process.png[Business process - sample]

Next create another business process that will receive that signal.

* go into business-application-kjar project
* click `Add asset` button
* select Business Process asset
* provide name for this asset (`catchsignalprocess`)
* create your business process

Sample business process should be a signal catch event and single user task assigned to `wbadmin`.
The catch signal event should use the signal same as throwing one and that is `IamDone`

image::BusinessApplications/tutorial-6-catch-process-event.png[Business process - sample]

Process should define single process variable `data` that is then mapped as data input of the catch event.

=== Configure service project to use the Apache Artemis

* Import business-application-service project into IDE of your choice
* Add dependency to the spring-boot-starter-artemis in your service pom.xml

[source, xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-artemis</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

* Add dependency to the jbpm-workitems-jms in your service pom.xml

[source, xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.jbpm</groupId>
  <artifactId>jbpm-workitems-jms</artifactId>
  <version>${version.org.kie}</version>
</dependency>
----

There are several configuration parameters that define how business application
will connect to Apache Artemis

* Edit application.properties file (that is located in src/main/resources)

[source, plain]
----
spring.artemis.mode=native
spring.artemis.host=localhost
spring.artemis.port=61616
spring.artemis.user=admin
spring.artemis.password=admin
----

NOTE: Use the user credentials you provided when creating the broker in the configuration

NOTE: Add the same entry into `application-dev.properties` file

=== Develop JMS components of your Business Application

First of all, you need to enable jms on the service level.

* Open Application class (located in src/main/java/com/company/service directory)
* Add `@EnableJms` on the class level (next to @SpringBootApplication)

Then create a new class that will be responsible for sending signals over JMS. This will
be really small extension to out of the box JMS work item handler.
`ConfiguredJMSSendTaskWorkItemHandler` needs to extend `org.jbpm.process.workitem.jms.JMSSendTaskWorkItemHandler`
and this is where the most of the logic comes from.

This class needs to autowire

* ConnectionFactory - used to connect to Apache Artemis
* JmsTemplate - used to send messages

Overload executeWorkItem method to take advantage of JmsTemplate instead of direct JMS API.

Last but not least, annotate the class with `@Component` annotation so it will be automatically registered as
work item handler. Below is the complete source code of the handler implementation.

[source, java]
----
package com.company.service.jms;

import javax.jms.ConnectionFactory;

import org.jbpm.process.workitem.jms.JMSSendTaskWorkItemHandler;
import org.kie.api.runtime.process.WorkItem;
import org.kie.api.runtime.process.WorkItemManager;
import org.springframework.jms.core.JmsTemplate;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component("External Send Task")
public class ConfiguredJMSSendTaskWorkItemHandler extends JMSSendTaskWorkItemHandler {

    private JmsTemplate jmsTemplate;

    public ConfiguredJMSSendTaskWorkItemHandler(ConnectionFactory connectionFactory, JmsTemplate jmsTemplate) {
        super(connectionFactory, null);
        this.jmsTemplate = jmsTemplate;
    }

    @Override
    public void executeWorkItem(WorkItem workItem, WorkItemManager manager) {
        try {
            jmsTemplate.send("ExternalSignalQueue", (session) -> createMessage(workItem, session));
            manager.completeWorkItem(workItem.getId(), null);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            handleException(e);
        }
    }
}
----

Last development activity is to create the message receiver. This is even easier than sender
as there is out of the box receiver from jBPM - `org.jbpm.process.workitem.jms.JMSSignalReceiver`

[source, java]
----
package com.company.service.jms;

import javax.jms.BytesMessage;

import org.jbpm.process.workitem.jms.JMSSignalReceiver;
import org.springframework.jms.annotation.JmsListener;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class ReceiveJMSEvents extends JMSSignalReceiver {

    @JmsListener(destination = "ExternalSignalQueue")
    public void processMessage(BytesMessage content) {
        super.onMessage(content);
    }

}
----

And that's it, you're all set to communicate between business processes via JMS.


=== Run the application

At this point all development effort is done, the last remaining thing is to pull
back the business assets project into the business-application-kjar project

* Go to business-application-kjar
* Execute `git remote add origin ssh://wbadmin@localhost:8001/MySpace/business-application-kjar` (if not already added)
* Execute `git pull origin master` - when prompted enter `wbadmin` as password

Go to `business-application-service` directory and launch the application

`./launch.sh clean install` for Linux/Unix

`./launch.bat clean install` for Windows

== Results

Once the build and launch is complete you can open your browser
http://localhost:8090[http://localhost:8090] to see your business
application up and running.

It presents with a welcome screen that is mainly for verification purpose
to illustrate that application started successfully.

You can point the browser to http://localhost:8090/rest/server[http://localhost:8090/rest/server]
to see the actual Business Automation capability services

NOTE: By default all REST endpoints (url pattern /rest/*) are secured and require
authentication. Default user that can be used to logon is `wbadmin` with password `wbadmin`

Next, point the browser to http://localhost:8090/rest/server/containers/business-application-kjar/processes[http://localhost:8090/rest/server/containers/business-application-kjar/processes]
to see business processes available for execution. You should see two processes:

* catchsignalprocess
* throwsignalprocess

=== Execute business process

You can execute business process via REST api exposed by your business application (in fact by Business Automation capability).

First start process instance that will wait for a signal

URL: `http://localhost:8090/rest/server/containers/business-application-kjar/processes/catchsignalprocess/instances`

HTTP method: POST

HTTP headers:

* Accept: application/json
* Content-Type: application/json


And then start process instance that will throw (send) signal via JMS

URL: `http://localhost:8090/rest/server/containers/business-application-kjar/processes/throwsignalprocess/instances`

HTTP method: POST

HTTP headers:

* Accept: application/json
* Content-Type: application/json

Body:

[source, json]
----
{
  "input":"hello"
}
----

NOTE: Remember that endpoints are protected so make sure you provide user name and password when making the request.

Verify that there is a user task assigned to `wbadmin` user with information coming from second process instance - `hello`


=== Execute business process from {CENTRAL} UI

Stop the application if it's running.

Go to `business-application-service` directory and launch the application in development mode

`./launch-dev.sh clean install` for Linux/Unix

`./launch-dev.bat clean install` for Windows

this will connect your business application to {CENTRAL} so can be administered
from within its UI.

Go to {CENTRAL} in the browser and navigate to servers (from the home screen).

Let's deploy the business-application-kjar to our running application.

* Go to projects from home screen of {CENTRAL}
* Go into business-application-kjar project
* Click `Deploy` button
* Make sure that `Server configuration` is set to `business-application-service-dev` and click ok

The project should be successfully deployed and you can examine that state by going back to servers
from home screen.

Next, go to process definitions (in Manage section of the Home screen) and select server configuration
(top right corner) - again it should be `business-application-service-dev` the list of available
process definition will be loaded and you should see your single process definitions from the project
`business-application-kjar`.

First start process instance that will wait for a signal (`catchsignalprocess`),
then start process instance that will throw (send) signal via JMS (`throwsignalprocess`).
When starting second process specify the input you want to send together with signal.

Go to Task inbox from home screen to see that task is created with input provided on the
second process instance.

== Summary

Congratulations! you have integrated your business application with JMS. Moreover, you
made business processes to talk to each other (over signals). This allows you to build
more advanced interactions based on your business logic.
