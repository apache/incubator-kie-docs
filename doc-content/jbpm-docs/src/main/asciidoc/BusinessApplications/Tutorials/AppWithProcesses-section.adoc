= Business Application with Business Assets

== What will you do

You will enhance your business application with some business assets

* business process (BPMN2)

and execute this business assets

* via REST api of your business application
* via {CENTRAL} UI

== What do you need

* About 15 minutes of your time
* Java (JDK) 8 or later
* Maven 3.5.x
* Access to the Internet
* {CENTRAL} deployed - see single distribution for instructions

== What should I do

If you haven't done it already, complete tutorial `My First Business Application`.

Start {CENTRAL} (if not already started) and open your browser at
http://localhost:8080/business-central[http://localhost:8080/business-central] and logon as
user `wbadmin` with password `wbadmin`

=== Import your business assets project into {CENTRAL}

* Go into business assets project - `business-application-kjar`
* Execute `git init`
* Execute `git add -A`
* Execute `git commit -m "my business assets project"`
* Log in to {CENTRAL} and go to projects
* Select import project and enter the following URL `file:///{path to your business application}/business-application-kjar`
* Click import and confirm project to be imported

=== Create Business Process

In browser where you logged into {CENTRAL} go to Projects. You will see your newly imported
project named business-application-kjar, go into that project.

* go into business-application-kjar project
* click `Add asset` button
* select Business Process asset
* provide name for this asset
* create your business process

Sample business process could be a single user task that will be assigned to user `wbadmin`.

=== Pull back your business assets to business application source code

* Go to business-application-kjar
* Execute `git remote add origin ssh://wbadmin@localhost:8001/MySpace/business-application-kjar`
* Execute `git pull origin master` - when prompted enter `wbadmin` as password

Go to `business-application-service` directory and launch the application

`./launch.sh clean install` for Linux/Unix

`./launch.bat clean install` for Windows

== Results

Once the build and launch is complete you can open your browser
http://localhost:8090[http://localhost:8090]

Next, point the browser to http://localhost:8090/rest/server/containers[http://localhost:8090/rest/server/containers]
to see that your business assets project has been properly deployed and is running.

NOTE: By default all REST endpoints (url pattern /rest/*) are secured and require
authentication. Default user that can be used to logon is `wbadmin` with password `wbadmin`

Next, point the browser to http://localhost:8090/rest/server/containers/business-application-kjar/processes[http://localhost:8090/rest/server/containers/business-application-kjar/processes]
to see business processes available for execution.

=== Execute business process

You can execute business process via REST api exposed by your business application (in fact by Business Automation capability).

URL: `http://localhost:8090/rest/server/containers/business-application-kjar/processes/{processid}/instances`
HTTP method: POST

Optionally HTTP headers can be set to change the format of data returned

* Accept: application/json for JSON format
* Accept: application/xml for XML (JAXB based) format
* X-KIE-ContentType: XSTREAM for XML (XStream based) format

{processid} needs to be replaced with actual process id that is returned from the endpoint http://localhost:8090/rest/server/containers/business-application-kjar/processes

NOTE: Remember that endpoints are protected so make sure you provide user name and password when making the request.

In response to this request, a process instance id should be returned.

    <value>1</value>

You can examine details of that process instance by pointing your browser to
http://localhost:8090/rest/server/containers/business-application-kjar/processes/instances/1[http://localhost:8090/rest/server/containers/business-application-kjar/processes/instances/1]

=== Execute business process from {CENTRAL} UI

Stop the application if it's running.

Go to `business-application-service` directory and launch the application in development mode

`./launch-dev.sh clean install` for Linux/Unix

`./launch-dev.bat clean install` for Windows

this will connect your business application to {CENTRAL} so can be administered
from within its UI.

Go to {CENTRAL} in the browser and navigate to servers (from the home screen).

image::BusinessApplications/tutorial-2-empty-server.png[]

As you can see the `business-application-service Dev` is there and connected. Although
it does not have any kjars deployed. This is because it's now running in managed mode
meaning it's {CENTRAL} that decides what kjars it should run.

So let's deploy the business-application-kjar to our running application.

* Go to projects from home screen of {CENTRAL}
* Go into business-application-kjar project
* Click `Deploy` button
* Make sure that `Server configuration` is set to `business-application-service-dev` and click ok

The project should be successfully deployed and you can examine that state by going back to servers
from home screen.

Next, go to process definitions (in Manage section of the Home screen) and select server configuration
(top right corner) - again it should be `business-application-service-dev` the list of available
process definition will be loaded and you should see your single process definition from the project
`business-application-kjar`.

image::BusinessApplications/tutorial-2-process-def.png[]

Examine details of that process definition by clicking on the row in the table. Switch to
`Diagram` tab to see the visual representation of your process definition.

Start new instance of the business process by clicking on `New instance` button. This will bring up
form (depending on your process definition) it might or might not have any fields. Just click on
`Submit` button to start process instance.

Once started process instance details will be opened, you can examine different sections to learn more about your active
process instance

image::BusinessApplications/tutorial-2-process-instance.png[]

* Instance details - base information about process instance
* Process variables - latest values for process variables
* Documents - list of documents managed by the process
* Logs - detailed logs about what has been done within the process instance
* Diagram - annotated diagram with completed (greyed out) and active (red borders) nodes

To look at user tasks, go to task inbox (in Track section of the Home screen). List of available
tasks will be presented. This time there is no need to select server configuration
because {CENTRAL} keeps track of recently selected configuration on different screens.

== Summary

Congratulations! you have enhanced your business application to actually do something - execute
business processes. At the same time you have created your first business process and
made successful integration between your business application and {CENTRAL}.
