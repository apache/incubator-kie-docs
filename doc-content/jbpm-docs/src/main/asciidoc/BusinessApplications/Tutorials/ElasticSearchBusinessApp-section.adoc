= Business Application with ElasticSearch

== What will you do

You will build business application that pushes out information about your business
automation (processes, cases, tasks) directly to an ElasticSearch server. You can then use
ElasticSearch REST api to perform advanced queries on top of your business data.

== What do you need

* About 20 minutes of your time
* Java (JDK) 8 or later
* Maven 3.5.x
* IDE of your choice
* Access to the Internet
* {CENTRAL} deployed - see single distribution for instructions

== What should I do

=== Install ElasticSearch

To get quickly up and running with ElasticSearch, make use of docker images provided by ElasticSearch.

[source, bash]
----
docker pull docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:6.4.2
----

Once pulled, start it with basic settings recommended for development and test.

[source, bash]
----
docker run -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 -e "discovery.type=single-node" docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:6.4.2
----

Wait a bit and your ElasticSearch will be up and running, to verify if it is working as expected, open
you browser at http://localhost:9200[http://localhost:9200] and you should see similar content

[source, json]
----
{
  "name" : "IKXT4Z_",
  "cluster_name" : "docker-cluster",
  "cluster_uuid" : "G7q7D2zgQy6JzLZBCzbtTQ",
  "version" : {
    "number" : "6.4.2",
    "build_flavor" : "default",
    "build_type" : "tar",
    "build_hash" : "04711c2",
    "build_date" : "2018-09-26T13:34:09.098244Z",
    "build_snapshot" : false,
    "lucene_version" : "7.4.0",
    "minimum_wire_compatibility_version" : "5.6.0",
    "minimum_index_compatibility_version" : "5.0.0"
  },
  "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
}
----

NOTE: when prompted for user name and password use elastic/changeme

=== Build business application

To get started with business applications the easiest way is to generate it using maven archetype commands. Please refer <<../../jbpm-docs/src/main/asciidoc/BusinessApplications/CreateApplication-section.adoc#_sect_BA_create_application, Create your business application section>>.

Now the directory  will consists of three projects

* business-application-model
* business-application-kjar
* business-application-service

Go into `business-application-service` directory. There you will find launch scripts
(for both linux/unix and windows).

Start {CENTRAL} (if not already started) and open your browser at
http://localhost:8080/business-central[http://localhost:8080/business-central] and logon as
user `wbadmin` with password `wbadmin`

=== Import your business assets project into {CENTRAL}

if not already imported proceed with points below to import business asset project

* Go into business assets project - `business-application-kjar`
* Execute `git init`
* Execute `git add -A`
* Execute `git commit -m "my business assets project"`
* Log in to {CENTRAL} and go to projects
* Select import project and enter the following URL `file:///{path to your business application}/business-application-kjar`
* Click import and confirm project to be imported

=== Create Business Process

In browser where you logged into {CENTRAL} go to Projects. You will see your newly imported
project named business-application-kjar, go into that project.

* go into business-application-kjar project
* click `Add asset` button
* select Business Process asset
* provide name for this asset
* create your business process

Sample business process could be a single user task that will be assigned to user `wbadmin`.

=== Configure service project to use the ElasticSearch

* Import business-application-service project into IDE of your choice
* Add dependency to the jbpm-event-emitters-elasticsearch in your service pom.xml

[source, xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.jbpm</groupId>
  <artifactId>jbpm-event-emitters-elasticsearch</artifactId>
  <version>${version.org.kie}</version>
</dependency>
----

There are several configuration parameters that define how business application
will connect to ElasticSearch server

* jbpm.addons.event.emitters.elasticsearch.url - location of the ElasticSearch server, defaults to http://localhost:9200
* jbpm.addons.event.emitters.elasticsearch.date_format - date format to be used for dates defaults to yyyy-MM-dd'T'hh:mm:ss.SSSZ
* jbpm.addons.event.emitters.elasticsearch.user - optional user name to be used to authenticate in ElasticSearch server
* jbpm.addons.event.emitters.elasticsearch.password - optional password to be used to authenticate in ElasticSearch server

If the defaults fit your ElasticSearch setup then you don't need to set any properties in application.properties.

For the default setup we use in this tutorial, user and password need to be set

* Edit application.properties file (that is located in src/main/resources)
* Add `jbpm.addons.event.emitters.elasticsearch.user=elastic` into the file
* Add `jbpm.addons.event.emitters.elasticsearch.password=changeme` into the file


NOTE: Add the same entry into `application-dev.properties` file

=== Run the application

At this point all development effort is done, the last remaining thing is to pull
back the business assets project into the business-application-kjar project

* Go to business-application-kjar
* Execute `git remote add origin ssh://wbadmin@localhost:8001/MySpace/business-application-kjar` (if not already added)
* Execute `git pull origin master` - when prompted enter `wbadmin` as password

Go to `business-application-service` directory and launch the application

`./launch.sh clean install` for Linux/Unix

`./launch.bat clean install` for Windows

== Results

Once the build and launch is complete you can open your browser
http://localhost:8090[http://localhost:8090] to see your business
application up and running.

It presents with a welcome screen that is mainly for verification purpose
to illustrate that application started successfully.

You can point the browser to http://localhost:8090/rest/server[http://localhost:8090/rest/server]
to see the actual Business Automation capability services

NOTE: By default all REST endpoints (url pattern /rest/*) are secured and require
authentication. Default user that can be used to logon is `wbadmin` with password `wbadmin`

Next, point the browser to http://localhost:8090/rest/server/containers/business-application-kjar/processes[http://localhost:8090/rest/server/containers/business-application-kjar/processes]
to see business processes available for execution. You should see just one.

=== Execute business process

You can execute business process via REST api exposed by your business application (in fact by Business Automation capability).

URL: `http://localhost:8090/rest/server/containers/business-application-kjar/processes/{processid}/instances`

HTTP method: POST

HTTP headers:

* Accept: application/json
* Content-Type: application/json

Body:

[source, json]
----
{
  "name":"wbadmin",
  "age":25
}
----

{processid} needs to be replaced with actual process id that is returned from the endpoint http://localhost:8090/rest/server/containers/business-application-kjar/processes

NOTE: Remember that endpoints are protected so make sure you provide user name and password when making the request.

Once executed you can verify the integration with ElasticSearch simply by pointing your browser to
http://localhost:9200/processes/_search?pretty=true[http://localhost:9200/processes/_search?pretty=true]
and the result should be as follows

[source, json]
----
{
  "took" : 1,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 5,
    "successful" : 5,
    "skipped" : 0,

          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
