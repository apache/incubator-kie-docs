= Comments

In case management, comments facilitate collaboration within the case instance, and allow case workers to easily communicate with each other to exchange information.

Comments are bound to the case instance. Case instances are part of the case file, so you can use comments to take action on the instances. Basic text-based comments can have a complete operations set, similar to CRUD (create, read, update, and delete).
