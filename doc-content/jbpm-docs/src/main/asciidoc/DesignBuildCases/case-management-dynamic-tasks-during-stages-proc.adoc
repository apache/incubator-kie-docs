= Adding a dynamic task to a stage

Dynamic tasks can be added to a case stage during run time using a REST API request. This is similar to adding a dynamic task to a case instance, but you must also define the `caseStageId` of the stage to which the task is added.

Use the following procedure to add a dynamic task to a stage in the *IT_Orders* sample project available in {CENTRAL} using the Swagger REST API tool. The same endpoint can be used for the REST API without Swagger.

.Prerequisites

* The *IT_Orders* sample project BPMN2 case definition has been reconfigured to use stages instead of milestones, as demonstrated in the provided example. For information about configuring stages for case management, see
ifeval::["{context}" == "case-management-design"]
xref:case-management-defining-a-stage-proc-case-management-design[].
endif::[]


.Procedure
. Start a new case using the Showcase application. For more information about using Showcase, see {URL_DEVELOPING_PROCESS_SERVICES}#assembly-showcase-application[_{SHOWCASE_APPLICATION_CASE_MANAGEMENT}_].
+
Because this case is designed using stages, the case details page shows stage tracking:
+
image::cases/case-with-stages-showcase.png[]
+
The first stage starts automatically when the case instance is created.
+
. As a `manager` user, approve the hardware specification in {CENTRAL} under *Menu* -> *Track* -> *Task Inbox*, then check the progress of the case.
.. In {CENTRAL}, click *Menu* -> *Manage* -> *Process Instances* and open the active case instance `IT-0000000001`.
.. Click *Diagram* to see the case progress.
. In a web browser, open the following URL:
+
`http://localhost:8080/kie-server/docs`.
. Open the list of available endpoints under *Case instances :: Case Management*.
. Click click the following `POST` method endpoint to open the details:
+
`/server/containers/{id}/cases/instances/{caseId}/stages/{caseStageId}/tasks`
+
. Click *Try it out* to complete the following parameters:
+
.Parameters
[cols="40%,60%",options="header"]
|===
|Name| Description
|`id` | `itorders`
|`caseId` | `IT-0000000001`
|`caseStageId` | `Order delivery`
|===
+
The `caseStageId` is the name of the stage in the case definition where the dynamic task is to be created. This can be any dynamic or service task payload. See xref:case-management-dynamic-subprocess-API-proc[] or xref:case-management-dynamic-service-task-API-proc[] for examples.

After the dynamic task has been added to the stage, it must be completed in order for the stage to complete and for the case process to move on to the next item in the case flow.
