= Business Dashboards

BPM solutions are not only made up with processes, rules or forms but also with data belonging to the customer business domain.
Such data is handled in the forms, the rules and, of course, the dashboards that are part of the solution.
Usually, dashboards feed with data coming from several sources of information, from business domain entities persisted into relational databases to data hold in legacy systems.
In order to cope with this kind of scenarios a generic highly customizable dashboard tooling is needed. 

It's obviously expected that a customer building a BPM solution want to track how its processes are performing.
To do so the customer need a monitoring and reporting tool.
This is the main reason why the Dashbuilder project has been included as a core module of the jBPM ecosystem.
Notice also that Dashbuilder, as an independent project, is not only used by jBPM but also by many other projects like, for example, JBoss Teiid a data virtualization system that allows applications to use data from multiple, heterogeneous data stores.

The _Business Dashboards_ gives users access to a rich environment where it is possible to author new content as well as configuring which entries
are displayed in the top menu bar.

[NOTE]
====
By default, {CENTRAL} uses a C3 Renderer API for chart libraries and no longer uses the Google Charts library. To revert to Google Charts,  build it from sources and add it to {CENTRAL} (see the `README.md` file in `dashbuilder-renderer-google`), and then set the renderer system property to `org.dashbuilder.renderer.default=gwtcharts`.
