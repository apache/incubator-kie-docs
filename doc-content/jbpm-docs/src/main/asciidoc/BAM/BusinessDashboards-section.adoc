= Business Dashboards

BPM solutions are not only made up with processes, rules or forms but also with data belonging to the customer business domain.
Such data is handled in the forms, the rules and, of course, the dashboards that are part of the solution.
Usually, dashboards feed with data coming from several sources of information, from business domain entities persisted into relational databases to data hold in legacy systems.
In order to cope with this kind of scenarios a generic highly customizable dashboard tooling is needed.

It's obviously expected that a customer building a BPM solution want to track how its processes are performing.
To do so the customer need a monitoring and reporting tool.
This is the main reason why the Dashbuilder project has been included as a core module of the jBPM ecosystem.
Notice also that Dashbuilder, as an independent project, is not only used by jBPM but also by many other projects like, for example, JBoss Teiid a data virtualization system that allows applications to use data from multiple, heterogeneous data stores.

The _Content Manager_ page gives you access to a rich environment where it is possible to author new content as well as configuring which entries are displayed in the top menu bar. You can access _Content Manager_ using the menu *Pages*.

[NOTE]
====
By default, {CENTRAL} uses a C3 Renderer API for chart libraries and no longer uses the Google Charts library. To revert to Google Charts,  build it from sources and add it to {CENTRAL} (see the `README.md` file in `dashbuilder-renderer-google`), and then set the renderer system property to `org.dashbuilder.renderer.default=gwtcharts`.

== Authoring Pages

In _Content Manager_  users can create pages which are be composed of components organized in a row and column layout. Components can be dragged to the page editor and a pop-up will be displayed with the component settings that can be modified by the user.

== Heatmaps

.Heatmaps Components

Heatmaps components are used to display heat information over a process diagram. You can retrieve the heat information from an execution server dataset which you can use with some of the heatmap components. You can use any kind of information to build the heatmap including process node execution time and hits.

The dataset used with the heatmap is a crucial part to build a meaningful visualization. The *Process Heatmap* requires users to provide two columns: *node id* and *heat value*. In component properties users must provide the *server template*, *container* and *process id*.

.Processes Heatmap Component

The *Processes Heatmaps* is a generic component which dataset must provide *container*, *process* and *node id* with the *heat value*. The only required property is *server template*. The component allows users to select a process to be displayed
