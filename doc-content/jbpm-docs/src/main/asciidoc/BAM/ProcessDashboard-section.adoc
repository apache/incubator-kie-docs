== Process Reports

The jBPM Process Process Reports is an specific use case of a dashboard feed from data coming from a relational database via SQL queries.
In this case, the database tables consumed are: _processinstancelog_ and _bamtasksummary_ both belonging to the jBPM engine. 

Every time the jBPM runtime updates the information stored into such tables the data becomes automatically available to the dashboard indicators.
The following picture shows the main screen that users get when navigating to the Process Reports.

[NOTE]
====
Notice, those are generic metrics not tied to any specific business process.
Nonetheless, it's worth to mention that it would be very easy for customers to modify, extend or adapt this generic dashboard for custom needs.
A customer could take the jBPM Process Reports as the base template for building a custom dashboard which mixes data coming
from the jBPM engine plus data coming from its own business domain.
====

To filter through the data users can click on the charts in order to select, for instance, a given process, a given status,
etc... Every time a filter is applied, all the indicators are automatically updated and synced according to the criteria set.
The next picture shows, for instance, what happens when both the process _Sales_ and the status _Active_ are selected.

.Active Process Filter

Using the built-in filter features is a good way to select the process instances the users want to look into.
Additionally, at any time, no matter whether there is any active filter or not, users can also navigate to the actual
list of instances the dashboard indicators are showing.
The _View table_ link at the top right side on the screen can be used to display those process instances details.
Once clicked, the view is switched to the screen shown in the next picture:

.Process Reports table view

From this view, users can access to process instances details just clicking on the desired row as well.

.Process Instance Details

Notice this is a read only view, just for monitoring purposes.
After identifying a target process instance the next step is to use the _jBPM Process Instance Console_ in case the
user needs to manage such process instance.

== Task Reports

The task reports section only contains indicators related to tasks.
It basically provides the same features introduced above for process instances (filters, show instances, get details),
 this time related to tasks instead of process though.

The following picture shows the Task reports header that users get when navigating to the Task Reports.

To sum up, the jBPM Process & Task Reports let users:

* To monitor their process and tasks
* To apply the proper filters in order quickly identify problematic instances
* To get the required information about a given instance in order to be able to fix any unexpected issue
