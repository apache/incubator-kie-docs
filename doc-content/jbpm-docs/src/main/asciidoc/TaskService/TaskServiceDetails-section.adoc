= Task Service and The Process Engine

As far as the {ENGINE} is concerned, human tasks are similar to any other external service that needs  to be invoked and are implemented as a domain-specific service.
(For more on domain-specific services,  see the chapter on them here.) Because a human task is an example of such a domain-specific service,  the process itself only contains a high-level, abstract description of the human task to be executed  and a work item handler that is responsible for binding this (abstract) task to a specific implementation.

Users can plug in any human task service implementation, such as the one that's provided by jBPM,  or they may register their own implementation.
In the next paragraphs, we will describe the human  task service implementation provided by jBPM.

The jBPM project provides a default implementation of a human task service based on the WS-HumanTask  specification.
If you do not need to integrate jBPM with another existing implementation of a human  task service, you can use this service.
The jBPM implementation manages the life cycle of the tasks  (creation, claiming, completion, etc.) and stores the state of all the tasks, task lists, and other  associated information.
It also supports features like internationalization, calendar integration,  different types of assignments, delegation, escalation and deadlines.
The code for the implementation  itself can be found in the jbpm-human-task module.

The jBPM task service implementation is based on the WS-HumanTask (WS-HT) specification.
This specification  defines (in detail) the model of the tasks, the life cycle, and many other features.
It is very comprehensive  and the first version can be found here.
