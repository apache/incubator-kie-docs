= Viewing the *Mortgage_Process* business rules
The goal of this chapter is to introduce you to the predefined business rules for the *Mortgage_Process* project. For this tutorial, you do not create and define the business rules. Instead, review the *WHEN* and *THEN* rules that are already defined in the *Mortgage_Process* sample project's preconfigured business rules. For information about creating guided business rules, see {URL_DEVELOPING_DECISION_SERVICES}#assembly-guided-rules[_{GUIDED_RULES}_].
