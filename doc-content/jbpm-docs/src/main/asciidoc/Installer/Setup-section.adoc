= Demo Setup


The easiest way to get started is to simply run the installation script to install the demo setup.
The demo install will setup all the web tooling (on top of WildFly) and Eclipse tooling in a pre-configured setup.
Go into the jbpm-installer folder where you unzipped the installer and (from a command prompt) run:

[source,shell]
----
ant install.demo
----


This will:

* Download WildFly application server
* Configure and deploy a process execution server
* Configure and deploy {CENTRAL}
* Configure and deploy the case management application
* Download Eclipse
* Install the Drools and jBPM Eclipse plugin
* Install the Eclipse BPMN 2.0 Modeler


Running this command could take a while (REALLY, not kidding, we are for example downloading an  Eclipse installation, even if you downloaded the full installer, specifically for your operating system).

[TIP]
====
The script always shows which file it is downloading (you could for example check whether it is still downloading by checking whether the size of the file in question in the  jbpm-installer/lib folder is still increasing). If you want to avoid downloading specific components (because you will not be using them or you already have them installed somewhere else), check below for running only specific parts of the demo or directing the installer to an already installed component.
====


Once the demo setup has finished, you can start playing with the various components by starting the demo setup:

[source,shell]
----
ant start.demo
----


This will:

* Start H2 database server
* Start WildFly application server
* Start Eclipse

Now wait until the process management console comes up:

http://localhost:8080/jbpm-console

The case management UI will be available on:

http://localhost:8080/jbpm-casemgmt

[NOTE]
====
It could take a minute to start up the application server and web application.
If the web page doesn't show up after a while, make sure you don't have a firewall blocking that port, or another application already using the port 8080.
You can always take a look at the server log {jbpm-installer-folder}/wildfly-{version}/standalone/log/server.log
====


Once everything is started, you can start playing with the Eclipse and web tooling, as explained in the following sections.

If you only want to try out the web tooling and do not wish to download and install the Eclipse tooling, you can use these alternative commands:

[source,shell]
----
ant install.demo.noeclipse
ant start.demo.noeclipse
----


Similarly, if you only want to try out the Eclipse tooling and do not wish to download and install the web tooling, you can use these alternative commands:

[source,shell]
----
ant install.demo.eclipse
ant start.demo.eclipse
----


Now continue with the 10-minute tutorials.
Once you're done playing and you want to shut down the demo setup, you can use:

[source,shell]
----
ant stop.demo
----


If at any point in time would like to start over with a clean demo setup - meaning all changes you did inside the web tooling and/or saved in the database will be lost, you can run the following command (after which you can run the installer again from scratch, note that this cannot be undone):

[source,shell]
----
ant clean.demo
----
