= Designer keyboard shortcuts overview

Designer includes a number of keyboard shortcuts you can use as an alternative
 to the mouse when modeling your business processes. These include some core functionalities
 such as copy, paste, delete, as well as utility shortcuts such as opening/closing
 menus and the property panel for example.
 Note that the Designer keyboard shortcuts may be somewhat different than the "traditional" shortcut
 options for similar operations you may encounter when dealing with browsers or word editors. This is done
 so that Designer does not replace or overwrite some of the keyboard shortcuts already used and claimed by different
 browsers you may use Designer in.

Below is the complete list of Designer keyboard shortcuts and their description.
