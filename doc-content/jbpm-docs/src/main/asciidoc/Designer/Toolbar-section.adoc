= Designer Toolbar

The Designer toolbar contains many different functions which can be used during process modelling.

.Toolbar Buttons
image::Designer/navbar1.png[]

We will now go through each of the buttons in the Designer Toolbar and give a brief overview of what it does.

(1) Save - allows users to save, copy, rename and delete the business process model.
In addition users can turn on auto-save which will automatically save the business process within a defined time interval.

.Save Button

(2) Cut  - enabled when a portion of the model is selected.

(3) Copy  - enabled when a portion of the model is selected.

(4) Paste  - paste the copied portion of the model onto the drawing board.

(5) Delete - enabled when there is a portion of the model is selected and removes it.

(6, 7) Undo/Redo - undo the last performed operation on the drawing canvas.

(8) Local History - local history allows continuous storage of your business process onto your browsers internal storage.
Stored version of the business process can persist internet outages or browser crashes so your work will not be lost.
This feature is disabled by default and must be enabled by users.
Once local history has been enabled users are able to view all previously stored snapshots of their business model, clear local history, configure the snapshot interval, or disable local history.
Note that local history will only take a snapshot of your business process on the set storing interval if there were some changes done in the model.
If at the end of the snapshot interval Designer detects that there were no changes since the last local history save, no new snapshot will be created.

.Local History

(9) Object positioning - allows users to position one or more nodes in the business process.
Note that at last one shape must be selected first, otherwise these options are disable.
Contains options "Bring to Front", "Bring to back", "Bring forward" and "Bring Backward".

(10) Alignment: enabled when a portion of the model is selected.
Includes options "Align Bottom", "Align Middle", "Align Top", "Align Left", "Align Center", "Align Right" and "Align Same Size".

(11, 12) Group and Ungroup - allows grouping and ungrouping of selected shapes on the drawing board.

(13, 14) Locking and Unlocking  - allows parts of the business model to be locked and unlocked.
Locked parts of the model cannot be edited (visual display and properties are both locked). Locked nodes are displayed in a light blue color.
This feature fosters collaboration of process modelling by allowing users to set parts of their model as "completed" and preventing any further changes to that portion.
Other parts of the model can continue to be edited.


.Locked Nodes

(15, 16) Add/Remove Docker - this allows users to add or remove Dockers, or edge points, to sequence flows in the model.
Enabled when a sequence flow (connector) is selected.
It allows users to create very customized connection points from one shape to another.
Users can add and remove as many dockers as they would like on a single sequence flow.

(17) Color Themes - Colors are a big part or process modelling as they help with expressing intent as well as help allowing visually impaired users to better view the model.
Designer provides two default color themes out of the box named "jBPM" and "High Contrast". The jBPM theme is the default theme used for all new business processes created.
Users can switch color themes and the changes will be applied to all nodes that are currently on the model, as well as any new shapes added.
Users have the ability to add new custom color themes by adding their own definitions in the  Designer themes.json file.
Color theme selection is persisted over browser close or possible crash/internet loss.

(18) Process and Task forms - here users have the ability to generate/edit process and task forms.
When no user task is selected the default enabled options are "Edit Process Form" and "Generate all Forms". Generate all forms will apply the current model information such as process variables, data objects, and the user tasks data input/output parameters and associations to generate default executable input forms.
Upon editing a process and task form, users have the choice between two form editors, the jBPM Form Modeler, and the Designer in-line meta editor.
The Designer meta editor is targeted more  to technical users as it is text based with the ability for live preview.
When the user selects an user task in the model, the "Edit Task Form" and "Generate Task Form" options are enabled which allow users to edit the particular task form, or choose to apply the same generation logic to create a task form for the selected task only.
Users have the ability to extend the default form generation templates in designer to create fully customized templates.
Node that in the case of the Designer meta editor for forms, generating forms will overwrite existing forms for the process and user tasks.
In the case of Form Modeler form generation, a merging algorithm is applied when generating.


.Form generation selection

When selecting a task, users have the ability to edit the selected tasks form via the form button shown above the user task node.

.In-line task editing
image::Designer/forms2.png[]
When editing forms, users are asked to choose between the Form Modeler and the Designer in-line meta editor.
If the user selects Form Modeler the form is shown in a new asset tab separately from Designer.
Designer meta editor is in-line and part of the Designer application.

.Form Editor Selection
image::Designer/forms3.png[]
The Designer in-line meta form editor is a powerful text-based editor with a live preview feature as well as auto-completion on process variables and user task data inputs/outputs.

(19) Process Information Sharing - this section includes many functions that help with sharing information of your model.
These include:

* Share process image - generates a stand-alone HTML image tag which contains a Base64 encoded image source of the current model on the canvas. This link can be shared to team members or other parties and embedded in any HTML content or email that allows HTML content embedding.
* Share process PDF - generates a stand-alone HTML object tag which contains a Base64 encoded PDF source of the current model on the canvas. This can similarly be shared and embedded in any HTML content.
* Download process PNG - generates a PNG image of the current process on the drawing board which users can download and share.
* Download process PDF - generates a PDF of the current process on the drawing board which can be downloaded and shared.
* View Process Sources - displays the current process sources in various formats, namely BPMN2, JSON, SVG, and ERDF. Also has the option to download the BPMN2 sources.

.Process Sources View
image::Designer/processsources.png[]

(20) Extra tooling - this section allows users to import their existing BPMN2 processes into designer as well as be able to migrate their old jPDL based processes to BPMN2.
For BPMN2 or JSON imports users can choose to add the import on top of the existing model on the drawing board or choose to replace the current one with the import.

(21) Visual Validation - Designer includes over 100 validation checks and this list is growing.
It allows users to view validation issues in real-time as they are modelling their business process.
Users can enable visual validation, disable it, as well as view all validation issues at once.
If Visual Validation is turned on, Designer with set the shape border of shapes that do not pass validation to red color.
Users can then click that particular shape to view the validation issues for that particular shape only.
Alternatively "View All Issues" present a combined list of all validation errors currently found.
Note that you do not have to periodically save your business process in order for validation to update.
It will do so on its own short intervals during modelling.
Users can extend the list of validation issues to include their own types of validation on certain elements of their business model.

(22) Process Simulation - Business Process Simulation deals with statistical analysis of process models over time.
It's main goals include

* Pre-execution and post-execution optimization
* Reducing the risk of change in business processes
* Predict business process performance
* Foster continuous improvements of performance, quality and resource utilization of business processes

Designer includes a powerful simulation engine which is based on jBPM and Drools and a graphical user interface to view and interpret simulation results.
In addition users are able to view all process paths included in their current model on the drawing board.
Designer Process Simulation is based on the BPSim 1.0 specification.
Details of Process Simulation capabilities in Designer are can be found in its Simulation documentation chapter.
Here we just give a brief overview of all features it contains.

.Simulation tooling section
image::Designer/sim1.png[]

When selecting Process Paths, the simulation engine find all possible paths in the business model.
Users can choose certain found paths and choose to display them.
The chosen path is marked with given colors as shown below.

.View all issues validation display
image::Designer/sim2.png[]

When selecting "Run Simulation", users have to enter in simulation runtime properties.
These include the number of instances of this business process to simulate and the interval time and units.
This interval is the time in-between consecutive simulation.

.Simulation runtime properties
image::Designer/sim3.png[]

Each shape on the drawing board includes Simulation properties (properties panel) where users can set numerous simulation properties for that particular shape.
More info on each of these properties can be found in the Simulation chapter of the documentation.
Designer pre-sets some defaults for new processes, which allows business processes to be simulated by default without any modifications of these properties.
Note however that the results of the default settings may not be optimal or targeted for the users particular needs.

.Simulation properties for shapes
image::Designer/sim4.png[]

Once the simulation runtime has completed, users are shown the simulation results in the "Simulation Results" tab of Designer.
The results default to the process results.
Users can switch to results for each particular shape in their business process to see more specific detauls.
In addition, the results contain process paths simulation results for each path in the business process.

.Sample simulation results
image::Designer/sim5.png[]
Designer simulation presents the users with many different chart types.
These include:

* Process results: Execution times, Activity instances, Total cost
* Human Task results: Execution times, Resource Utilization, Resource Cost
* All other nodes: Execution times
* Process Paths: Path Execution
The below image shows a number of possible chart types users can view after process simulation has completed.

.Types of simulation results charts
image::Designer/sim6.png[]
In addition to the chart results, Designer simulation also offers a full timeline display that includes all details of what happened during simulation.
This timeline allows users to navigate through each event that happened during process simulation and select a particular node to display results at that particular point in time.

.Simulation timeline
image::Designer/sim7.png[]
The simulation timeline can be switched to the Model view.
This view displays the process model with the currently selected node in the timeline highlighted.
The highlighted node displays the simulation results at that particular point in time of the simulation.

(23) Service Repository - Allows users to connect to a service repository via its URL and see the list of available services it provides. Each of the listed services can then be installed into the users project by clicking on the "wrench" icon next to each listed service.
Installing a service does the following things:

* Installs the service configuration (wid) into the users {CENTRAL} project. This can later be edited via the Workitem Definitions Editor.
* Installs the service icon (defined in the service configuration) and if one does not exist a default one will be provided.
* Installs the service maven dependencies into the project POM.
* Installs the service default handler into the project Deployment Descriptor.

Users will be notified when the service is successfully installed. After the install users have to re-open the business process to be able to start using the installed services.

(24) Full screen Mode - allows users to place the drawing board of Designer into full-screen mode.
This can help with better visualizing larger business processes without having to scroll.
Note that this feature is possible only if your browser has full screen mode capabilities.
If it does not designer will show a message stating this to the user.

.Full Screen Mode

(25) Process Dictionary - Designer Dictionary Editor allows users to create their own dictionary entries or harvest from process documentation or business requirement documents.
Process Dictionary entries can be used as auto-completion for shape names.
This will be expanded in the  future versions to allow mapping of node patters to specific dictionary entries as well.
Users can add entries to the dictionary in the Dictioanry Editor or from the selected shapes directly.
