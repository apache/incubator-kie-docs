= New and Noteworthy in jBPM 6.4.0


The following features were added to jBPM 6.4

== New jBPM Process & Task Dashboard


The jBPM Process Dashboard has been entirely rewritten in this version and now is based on a native workbench perspective instead of a separate web application.
The main goal is to deliver a better user experience, thanks to a much more appealing as well as polished user interface.


This dashboard version also provides the ability to navigate from the graphical indicators to any of the related process or task instances.
Now, end users can easily find out the instances that are related to a given indicator and deep into their details as well.


The resulting dashboard is more fluent, more interactive and with a better integration with the jBPM runtime.

== Task variables auditing


By default process variables are stored in audit tables (VariableInstanceLog) that allows simplified access to variable values without the need to load individual process instances.
Moreover that provides option to search by process variables and process variable values e.g.
to find process instances that have given value for given variable.

This was missing for task variables as task variables were not stored in any audit tables.
This has been improved in version 6.4.0 and now task variables are stored in audit table (TaskVariableImpl) by default.
It does follow the same mechanism as for process variables - variable.toString() is the value stored in the table.
With this services and query APIs have been enhanced to take advantage of this support and to search for tasks by their variables.

== Process and task variables indexation


By default process and task variables are indexed with simplest possible mechanism - that is variable.toString() while for some object this can be sufficient, like simple types, for others it can cause significant problems when performing queries.
To solve the problem process and task variables are equipped with pluggable indexation.
This is realized by two interfaces that shall be implemented to provide custom indexation behavior.

* org.kie.internal.process.ProcessVariableIndexer
* org.kie.internal.task.api.TaskVariableIndexer

details about how to use the indexers can be found in  Audit log section of the documentation

== QueryService


QueryService that is an addition to jbpm services, brings in power of Dashbuilder DataSets (SQL based) to jbpm services.
This allows more tailored queries that can include both jBPM tables and external tables such as external system data.
With this users are in control of what data and how data are going to be queried.

Dashbuilder DataSet introduce concept of building "database views" for part of the data that can later on be filtered to find relevant data for given invocation.

QueryService is available for all add-ons for services meaning pure java, CDI and EJB.

== Pluggable Task deadlines notification listeners


One of task deadlines actions is notification which by default is implemented as email notification.
Although this type of notification does not always fit the requirement.
To allow custom notification to be used, jBPM 6.4 was enhanced to support pluggable notification listeners.
Notification is realized as broadcast, meaning all available listeners will be invoked, although each listener can decide if it shall react to given notification or not.
For instance email notification listener will only send email if it's properly configured (with mail server etc) otherwise it will ignore the notification.

== Ability to show business data at task list.


The user can now create a specific filter that provides domain specific columns to be added to a task list.
When the user creates a custom filter for a specific task name the task variables are enabled as columns. 

The custom filter that activates the capability to display task variables as columns is set a filter with the restriction Name="taskName".

When the filter with the restriction over a specific task name is applied, the task associated variables appear as a selectable columns, to the task list.

== Process Documentation.


Users are able to view and share process documentation during business process modelling.
Process documentation is dynamically updated as users are working on their business process.

Users can print the documentation or view it as a png file.

Process Documentation includes the following sections: 

* Process Overview (general info, process variables, globals, and imports)
* Process Element Details (totals, and specific element information)
* Process Image
