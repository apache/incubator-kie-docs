= New and Noteworthy in jBPM 7.21.0

The following features were added to jBPM 7.21


== Added access to Service Level Agreement (SLA) tracking of tasks

Task-related SLA information is now visible in the *Tasks* and *Task Inbox* pages in {CENTRAL}. The *SLA Compliance*
status is shown in the task details and two new selectable columns have been added to the task lists: *SLA compliance*
and *SLA due date*. The filters now have a new *SLA Compliance* selector that enables you to filter the tasks by their
*SLA Compliance* status.

== {KIE_SERVER} and Business Application monitoring using Prometheus

In this release, the {KIE_SERVER} has been extended for collecting jBPM related metrics using https://prometheus.io/[Prometheus].
A new server extension has been included, responsible for collecting and exposing this information in the format required
by Prometheus. 

To enable this new extension, set the Prometheus system property to `org.kie.prometheus.server.ext.disabled=false`.
When you enable this extension, a series of metrics will be collected, including information about {KIE_SERVER} deployments,
start time, data sets, execution errors, jobs, tasks, processes, cases, and more. For the complete list of metrics, see the 
https://github.com/kiegroup/droolsjbpm-integration/tree/master/kie-server-parent/kie-server-services/kie-server-services-prometheus[Prometheus services repository] on GitHub.

After the extension is started, you can access the available metrics at _${context}/services/rest/metrics_.  
For example: 

``` 
curl -u wbadmin:wbadmin http://localhost:8080/kie-server/services/rest/metrics
``` 

Additionally, this extension is also available for your Business Application. To enable it, update your `application.properties`
file to include the setting `kieserver.prometheus.enabled=true`. After your application is running, all 
metrics will be available under `/rest/metrics`.
