= New and Noteworthy in jBPM 7.20.0

The following features were added to jBPM 7.20


== Ability to invoke a DMN decision service from jBPM business rule tasks

Business rule tasks have been improved to enable you to invoke a DMN decision service.

== KIE container ID filters for process and task instances

You can now filter process and task instances by KIE container ID (deployment unit ID).

== Form generation for classes from external dependencies

The forms designer supports form generation from classes that are not part of the project
but that are added as dependencies of the project.

== Added support to document lists on forms

A new *Document Collection* widget is available in the forms designer that enables you to upload  multiple documents to a process or task form.
You can use the *Document Collection* widget for process or task forms that have a variable with the type `org.jbpm.document.DocumentCollection`. 
Additionally it also supports the legacy type `org.jbpm.document.Documents`.

== Significant improvement of JMS client for KIE Server

The JMS client for KIE Server has been enhanced to enable you to reuse JAXB context
that significantly improves overall performance of KIE Server client operations
with JMS.
