= New and Noteworthy in jBPM 7.15.0

The following features were added to jBPM 7.15


== Manage section error messages handling

This release includes improvements to error scenarios when using any of the manage section operations, providing more detailed
information about exceptions when communicating with a remote server.
A more specific alert panel for when no Kie Server instance is connected or is missing the required `Process`
capability is also included to better inform users.

== New timeline view for Task Logs

In this release, Task Logs view was redesigned, allowing users to easily visualize the events related
to a specific task based on a timeline of events.
Events are highlighted in blue to indicate a transition in the Task lifecycle for events like 'Claim' and 'Start' and
have a grey out highlight to indicate the completion of the task or a user releasing it.

By default, the latest 10 events are presented in the timeline but users can load more data all the way back to the
the task creation.

== KIE Server forms HTML elements support for variables

Recently added KIE Server Form Rendering has been enhanced to extract variables in HTML elements of the form.
When designing forms and using HTML elements users can refer to process/task variables to be extracted on rendering time.

[source, html]
----
<h3>Hello ${user.name}!</h3>
----

Above expression (`${user.name}`) will be extracted at rendering time assuming there is user (task or process) variable available.

== Camel component for jBPM has been significantly improved.

Apache Camel comes with huge set of components to integrate with various systems. There has been
*camel-jbpm* for quite some time (since 2.6 version of Camel) but it was based on v6 `kie-remote-client`
and supported only producer.

With Camel version 2.23.0 *camel-jbpm* component has been significantly improved and upgraded. It now supports the latest
version of jBPM and for producer it relies on `kie-server-client` instead `kie-remote-client`.
In addition to that consumer support has been added which allows to use camel routes that will be initiated by:

* process event listeners
* task life cycle event listeners
* case event listeners

On top of that there is also camel based event emitter that allows to send events through event emitter infrastructure using camel routes.

See the http://mswiderski.blogspot.com/2018/11/jbpm-empowered-by-camel-to-integrate.html[article] for more details and a sample project.

== Audit log mode applies to task and case audit logs

Well known audit mode setting from deployment descriptor now supports all three types of audit logs

* process (has been supported from the beginning)
* task
* case

Audit modes that are supported are:

* JPA (default)
* JMS
* None

NOTE: None does not apply to case audit data as these are mandatory to be stored (either directly or via JMS).

== Variable indexer supported for case file data

Process and task variables allow to use custom VariableIndexer to store the information in log tables.
7.15 comes with support for using VariableIndexer for case file data. An example of case variable
indexer can be found below

[source, java]
----
public class PatientCaseVariableIndexer implements CaseVariableIndexer {

    @Override
    public boolean accept(Object variable) {
        return Patient.class.isAssignableFrom(variable.getClass());
    }

    @Override
    public List<CaseFileData> index(String name, Object variable) {
        List<CaseFileData> indexed = new ArrayList<CaseFileData>();

        CaseFileDataLog caseVariable = new CaseFileDataLog();
        caseVariable.setItemName(name);
        caseVariable.setItemValue(variable == null ? "" : variable.toString());
        caseVariable.setItemType(variable.getClass().getName());

        indexed.add(caseVariable);

        // add mapped information as another entry
        CaseFileDataLog caseVariableMapped = new CaseFileDataLog();
        caseVariableMapped.setItemName(name + "_name");
        caseVariableMapped.setItemValue(((Patient) variable).getName());
        caseVariableMapped.setItemType(String.class.getName());

        indexed.add(caseVariableMapped);

        return indexed;
    }
}
----

In the above mentioned example single Patient case variable will be stored in data log table
as two entries (rows) to allow more fine grained searching capabilities.
