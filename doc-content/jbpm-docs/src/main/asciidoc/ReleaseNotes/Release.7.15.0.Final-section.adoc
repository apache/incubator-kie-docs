= New and Noteworthy in jBPM 7.15.0

The following features were added to jBPM 7.15


== Manage section error messages handling

This release includes improvements to error scenarios when using any of the manage section operations, providing more detailed
information about exceptions when communicating with a remote server.
A more specific alert panel for when no Kie Server instance is connected or is missing the required `Process`
capability is also included to better inform users.

== New timeline view for Task Logs

In this release, Task Logs view was redesigned, allowing users to easily visualize the events related
to a specific task based on a timeline of events.
Events are highlighted in blue to indicate a transition in the Task lifecycle for events like 'Claim' and 'Start' and
have a grey out highlight to indicate the completion of the task or a user releasing it.

By default, the latest 10 events are presented in the timeline but users can load more data all the way back to the
the task creation.
