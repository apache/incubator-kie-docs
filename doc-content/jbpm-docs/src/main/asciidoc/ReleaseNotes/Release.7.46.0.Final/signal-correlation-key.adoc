= New API to signal process instance with correlation key


A signal can now be sent to a particular process instance id by using correlation key (before this change you have to use the process instance id), by invoking added _signalProcessInstanceByCorrelationKey_ methods on https://github.com/kiegroup/jbpm/blob/master/jbpm-services/jbpm-services-api/src/main/java/org/jbpm/services/api/ProcessService.java[ProcessService] interface or using REST API: http://${HOST}:${PORT}/kie-server/services/rest/server/containers/${CONTAINER}/processes/instances/correlation/${CORRELATION_KEY}/signal/${SIGNAL_NAME}
