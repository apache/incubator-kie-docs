== New chart API for {CENTRAL}

{CENTRAL} uses a new API for chart rendering based on C3 and D3. The C3 Renderer API is used by default and implements all of the features from the previous chart library, Google Charts. The Google Charts library is now deprecated and removed from {CENTRAL}. To revert to Google Charts,  build it from sources and add it to {CENTRAL} (see the `README.md` file in `dashbuilder-renderer-google`), and then set the renderer system property to `org.dashbuilder.renderer.default=gwtcharts`.
