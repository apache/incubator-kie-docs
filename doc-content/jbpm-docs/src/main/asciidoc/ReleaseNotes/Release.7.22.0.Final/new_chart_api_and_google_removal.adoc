== New Chart API

Business Central uses a new API for charts rendering based on C3 and D3. The C3 Renderer API is used by default, now it implements all the features from the legacy chart library, GCharts, consequently GCharts is marked as deprecated and is removed from the standard distribution. To switch back to Google Charts you have to build it from sources and add it to Business Central (see README.md in `dashbuilder-renderer-google`), then you can use the system property `org.dashbuilder.renderer.default`, which should have the ID of the renderer you want to use by default. For google charts you should use `org.dashbuilder.renderer.default=gwtcharts`.
