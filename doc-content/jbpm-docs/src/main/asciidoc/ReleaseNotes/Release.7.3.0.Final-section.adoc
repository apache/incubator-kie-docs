= New and Noteworthy in jBPM 7.3.0

The following features were added to jBPM 7.3

== KIE Workbench Monitoring Web Application

A new distribution war has been added to the project in this release. The goal for the KIE Monitoring Web Application is to be used along with Kie Server instances, managing all runtime capabilities. This includes managing containers, process instances, tasks, dashboards and more. As opposed to the standard Kie Workbench distribution, no authoring capabilities are offered,

== KIE Server Maven Plugins

With version 7.3 KIE Server has been empowered with additional Maven Plugins that allow to interact with KIE Server and KIE Controller REST api directly from within a build.
This enables easier integration with CI/CD pipelines when building KJars so they can be directly deployed to execution environment (both managed and unmanaged KIE Servers).

=== Process Designer (Preview)

The new jBPM Process Designer (_Stunner_) provides stability enhancements again by introducing several bug fixings, tests and reviews.

On the other hand this release includes some new cool core features:

** Improving user experience & usability by introducing enhancements in the connections and magnets capabilities. At this point:
*** Connections can be attached to a concrete shape magnet. Irrespective of the location of shape, the connection will target the specified magnet
*** Connections can be attached to the shape's center magnet. In this case the connector/connections point to the shape's border, depending on its location
*** Connections can be attached to the shape area, instead of a concrete magnet. This produces the magnet to be automatically updated depending on the shape's location
*** Notice this information is also being persisted and stored in the BPMN diagram files

** Integration for validation and error messages into the workbench's IDE. This way users can keep track of the validations and errors produced during the modelling phase and link back to the canvas and the affected shapes in order to fixing the issues
