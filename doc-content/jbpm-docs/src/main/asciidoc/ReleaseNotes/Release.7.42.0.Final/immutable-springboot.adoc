= Immutable SpringBoot Deployments

When building a SpringBoot application which embeds the jBPM process engine, the necessary processes (and rules, forms, etc.), bundled in a kjar, can be either embedded as part of the application or loaded on the fly.  In cloud environments, immutable applications are often wanted, and we have therefore improved our kie-maven-plugin to more easily include all necessary kjars (and dependencies) as part of the application so it is self-contained, by adding a new package-dependencies-kjar goal.
