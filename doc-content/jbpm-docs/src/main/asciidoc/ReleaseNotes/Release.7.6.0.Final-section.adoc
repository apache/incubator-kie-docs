*** Added Throwing Intermediate Message Event
*** Improved signal management for events
*** New widget which improves the declaration for the timer event related properties

== Form Modeler

Old jBPM Form Modeler has been deprecated and new Form Modeler has become the default Forms Engine (a migration tool will be provided to move old forms into the new forms format).
This new version improves the Forms Engine stability and provides several fixes for different bugs.

Most important features:

** Added form synchronization on editor startup to fix possible errors caused by model changes (properties removed, type changes...)

== Quartz upgraded to 2.2.3

Scheduler Service based on Quartz has been upgraded to use latest version of Quartz library 2.2.3. That means when updating to 7.6.0 of jBPM and existing
installation uses Quartz as scheduler service that will require upgrade before moving further. jBPM comes with upgrade script that is delivered as part
of jBPM installer and is specific to data base being used by Quartz.

It is located in jBPM installer/db/upgrade-scripts/{database-name}/quartz-upgrade.sql

Procedure to be followed is:

- stop jBPM (for example kie server)
- upgrade Quartz data base with suitable quartz-upgrade.sql script (according to data base used)
- upgrade jBPM (for exmaple kie server binaries)
- start jBPM

There are no changes in the quartz.properties file as it will work exactly the same.


== Support for lazy loaded variables

Pluggable variable persistence strategy has been improved to support (optionally) lazy loaded variables. That is mainly to improve performance and
reduce load on external systems that store these variables. Especially valid for documents that could be of significant size and could be stored in
external document management systems. To read up more on this see http://mswiderski.blogspot.com/2017/12/be-lazy-with-your-data.html[this article]

== Expose readiness and liveness checks in KIE Server

KIE Server has been equipped by default with readiness and liveness checks (REST endpoints)

- readiness will either respond with 200 (OK) when it's actually ready or with 503 (Service Unavailable) when it's still booting/deploying containers/waiting for controller.
- liveness (aka health check) will perform following:
  ** check readiness
  ** check for failed kie containers
  ** ask each active extension to health check itself
  response codes for health check are same as for readiness. Meaning that any error found will result in response 503,
  regardless if that is failed container, failed extension or not ready yet.

Health check can be invoked in two modes:

- basic - that will return status only (200 or 503)
- report - will respond with both status and report in response body that will provide info like below (body can be XML or JSON)

Examples:

- Readiness check `http://localhost:8080/kie-server/services/rest/server/readycheck`
- Liveness check `http://localhost:8080/kie-server/services/rest/server/healthcheck`
- Liveness check with report `http://localhost:8080/kie-server/services/rest/server/healthcheck?report=true`


== Allow to disable management api of KIE Server

Administrators can decide to disable management api of KIE Server - that is to disallow modifying server configuration once the server was started.
This is especially important when running in cloud based environments where the image consists of kjars to be active and no other kjars should be
deployed to it.

By setting system property `org.kie.server.mgmt.api.disabled` to value `true` KIE Server will disable management api (that changes the state of it)
and when attempted will always respond with code 400 (Bad Request). This applies both to REST api and JMS api.


== Spring Boot support for KIE projects

KIE projects (jBPM, Drools and OptaPlanner) has been prepared for running in Spring Boot setup for a while now but with 7.6.0 release they are
providing so called starters that can be easily used to bootstrap your projects with Spring Boot.
