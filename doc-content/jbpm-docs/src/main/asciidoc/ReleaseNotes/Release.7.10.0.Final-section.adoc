= New and Noteworthy in jBPM 7.10.0

The following features were added to jBPM 7.10

== jBPM Server Full Distribution Docker image

Version 7.10 introduces another way for people to get started very quickly.
As an addition to the http://jbpm.org/learn/gettingStarted.html[single zip distribution] that we recently added on version 7.8.0.Final,
you can now also use the https://hub.docker.com/r/jboss/jbpm-server-full/[jbpm-server-full] Docker image to have a fully configured and running environment.

If you already have https://docs.docker.com/install/[Docker] installed on your local machine, all you need to do is run the following command:

[source]
----
docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 8001:8001 -d --name jbpm-server-full jboss/jbpm-server-full:latest
----

Once container and web applications started, you can navigate to it and login using the user name `wbadmin` and password `wbadmin`
or any of the users available in the http://jbpm.org/learn/gettingStarted.html[getting started] document.

    http://localhost:8080/jbpm-console

that's all that is needed to get fully configured and running jBPM distribution that includes:

- WildFly server
- jBPM Console (aka workbench)
- KIE Server
- jBPM Case Management showcase
- jBPM Service repository

Everything configured to work together smoothly and you can access them at the following locations:

- jBPM console - http://localhost:8080/jbpm-console
- KIE Server - http://localhost:8080/kie-server/services/rest/server
- KIE Server Swagger docs - http://localhost:8080/kie-server/docs
- jBPM case management - http://localhost:8080/jbpm-casemgmt
- jBPM Service repository - http://localhost:8080/repository

For mode details please read our updated http://jbpm.org/learn/gettingStarted.html[Getting Started] page, where you can find advanced information about using this new Docker image.

== Jobs Management: Added bulk actions

The jobs list provides now a way to perform actions over multiple jobs, in a single operation.
After one or more jobs are selected from the list, the bulk actions menu becomes available, with all supported actions.
The available operations in this screen are 'Cancel' and 'Requeue'. If that operation is not allowed, regarding the job status,
over any of the selected item, a notification is displayed and the operation is not executed on that item.

== Process Instances Management: Further flexibility to access process instance related data

When retrieving process instance data, from one or more Kie Server instances, we used to enforce the rule that only data from active deployment units would be available.
That is not a requirement any longer, as long as the data is persisted in the database, it is now possible to list and display most of the information for any process instance.
There is no need for the container to be running in order to list process instances in the *Manage Process Instances* area.
Please note that the following data is not available when the deployment unit is not available:

- Process instance diagram: As the actual image is hosted as part of the container resources, it is not possible to display the diagram.
- Process instance variables: Only variables that changed its value during the process execution are listed.

== CaseData type information is auto-imported into the process context

Prior to version 7.10 whenever referring to CaseData type a fully qualified class name has to be given. This applies to:

- Milestone conditions
- Stage (activation and completion) conditions

This has now been improved to allow short and direct reference to CaseData instead of `org.kie.api.runtime.process.CaseData` and CaseAssignment instead
of `org.kie.api.runtime.process.CaseAssignment`.

== Stage name to trigger adhoc fragments

Initially to trigger adhoc fragments within given stage that required to use the identifier of the stage, 7.10 brings in additional option to refer to stage by name.
This simplifies usability of the trigger operations and allow more human friendly approach.

== Parameterized stage names

In addition to referring to stages by names, stages can now have parameterized names which will allow to distinguish them between each other in situations
when there are multiple stage instances of the same stage (definition). This makes it possible to trigger ad hoc fragments in particular stage instance when
referring to it my name and the name is unique due to use of parameters in the stage definition - `Stage #{variable}`

== Archetypes

jBPM 7.10 introduces new maven archetypes to easily generate:

- KJAR projects outside of workbench - allows to generate regular project and case project
- service project - a fully featured service based on SpringBoot and equipped with business automation capabilities (kie server apis)

NOTE: Work in progress - This is an initial delivery which will be significantly improved over the coming weeks to provide comprehensive
solution to build business applications with jBPM as one of the capabilities.

Take a look at the following documentation to learn more about these archetypes -
https://github.com/kiegroup/droolsjbpm-knowledge/blob/master/kie-archetypes/kie-kjar-archetype/README.md[kjar archetype]
and https://github.com/kiegroup/droolsjbpm-knowledge/blob/master/kie-archetypes/kie-service-spring-boot-archetype/README.md[service archetype].

== Process instance migration with timers

This is a worth noting bug fix that affects process instances with timers within subprocesses. Prior to this version such timers were simply canceled and
not rescheduled after migrating process instances. This has been fixed and thus it is strongly recommended to upgrade to version 7.10 as soon as possible
if you plan to migrate active process instances and there are timers within subprocesses.

== JPA entities can be used as case file variables

Case file follows same approach for externalizing data storage, meaning different type of data can be stored in different systems. With 7.10 it is now
possible to use JPA entities as case file variables that will be stored in separate database columns.

The only requirement is to configure the marshaller in deployment descriptor

[source]
----
.withJpa("org.jbpm.persistence.patient.example")
----

and the complete registration of the marshaller is:

[source]
----
org.jbpm.casemgmt.impl.marshalling.CaseMarshallerFactory.builder().withDoc().withJpa("org.jbpm.persistence.patient.example").get()
----
