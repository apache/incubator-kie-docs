= Immutable SpringBoot Deployments

When building a SpringBoot application that embeds the jBPM process engine, the necessary processes (rules, forms, and so in), bundled in a kjar, can be either embedded as part of the application or loaded on the fly. In cloud environments, immutable applications are often wanted, and we have therefore improved our kie-maven-plugin that includes all necessary kjars (and dependencies) as part of the application so it is self-contained, by adding a new package-dependencies-kjar goal.
