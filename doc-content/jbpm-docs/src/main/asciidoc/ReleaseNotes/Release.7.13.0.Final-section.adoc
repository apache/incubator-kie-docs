= New and Noteworthy in jBPM 7.13.0

The following features were added to jBPM 7.13

== Default pagination system preference for Manage result lists in jBPM Console

Starting from this version, users with the _Edit Global Preferences_ permission will be able to define the default
pagination option to be used for all users under the Manage items ( Process Definition, Process Instances, Tasks, Jobs and Execution Errors )
and Task Inbox.
The new preference ( Process Administration ) is available in the global settings page and once a new default is applied it will be effective for all users which still don't
have a custom preference saved for these items.

== Managing work item handler exception

Work items are very powerful concept in jBPM, they are responsible for heavy lifting in your business
processes. In many cases there is a need to handle exception situations in their execution.
jBPM 7.13 comes with additional handling support based on special type of exception
`ProcessWorkItemHandlerException`. As implementor of the work item handler you can throw
such exception that allows to specify

* process id
* handling strategy

which in turn will be automatically used to start sub process instance to deal with that exception.

== Form renderer in KIE Server

This has been on the todo list for quite a bit and finally it goes out!

KIE Server can now deliver fully functional form (HTML) that allows to

* start process instance
* start case instance
* work on user task

KIE Server can easily render forms designed in workbench's form modeller. The same forms can then be used
in workbench or directly through KIE Server REST api.

To learn more about this feature have a look at http://mswiderski.blogspot.com/2018/10/lets-embed-forms-rendered-by-kie-server.html[this article]

Currently there are few limitations that will be tackled in the coming releases

* multi sub forms are not supported yet
* date picker relies on HTML5 input type date - thus is browser dependant
* multi select dropdowns are not supported yet

== HTTPS support for smart router

Smart Router (aka Kie Server Router) has been enhanced to allow to enable HTTPS traffic on it.
https://github.com/kiegroup/droolsjbpm-integration/blob/master/kie-server-parent/kie-server-router/README.md[See here] to learn on how to enable it.

== Deactivation of kie containers on KIE Server

KIE Server got two additional features on KIE Container level that allows to deactivate given container.
This is mainly for jBPM extension of KIE Server and allows to pause creation of new process instances
from given container but at the same time allow to work on already existing process instances and tasks.

In case the deactivation should only be temporary, given container can be activated again. All these operations
do not require server restarts.

== Resolution of data source in advanced queries

Data source in advanced queries can be given as expression that points to a system variable. That allows
to create query definition and deployed to multiple runtime environments. With 7.13 the resolution
mechanism has been improved to resolve it on actual registration in runtime environment instead of at creation time.
This in turn makes it possible to change data source between server restarts without errors in already defined queries.

== Process instance migration support for async jobs

Process instance migration has been improved to deal with asynchronous jobs that are started
as part of process instance. The mechanism mainly guards the migration to not be allowed when

* there are queued jobs
* there are running jobs
* there are retrying jobs

Migration is only allowed when async job is in error state so it can be requeued after process instance migration.
