= New and Noteworthy in jBPM 7.13.0

The following features were added to jBPM 7.13

== Default pagination system preference for Manage result lists in jBPM Console

Starting from this version, users with the _Edit Global Preferences_ permission will be able to define the default
pagination option to be used for all users under the Manage items ( Process Definition, Process Instances, Tasks, Jobs and Execution Errors )
and Task Inbox.
The new preference ( Process Administration ) is available in the global settings page and once a new default is applied it will be effective for all users which still don't
have a custom preference saved for these items.
