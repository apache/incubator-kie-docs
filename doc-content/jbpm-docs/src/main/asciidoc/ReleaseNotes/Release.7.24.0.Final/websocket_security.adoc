= User role requirement for WebSocket clients to access the built-in {CONTROLLER} in {CENTRAL} 

Starting this release, if you use WebSocket protocol in your Java client to connect to the built-in {CONTROLLER} in {CENTRAL},
you must configure the client with the `rest-all` user role in order to access the {CONTROLLER} REST API.
This enhancement ensures that WebSocket clients have proper access and security when interacting with the {CONTROLLER} in {CENTRAL}.
