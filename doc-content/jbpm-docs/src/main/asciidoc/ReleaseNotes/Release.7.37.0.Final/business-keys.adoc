= Case identifier customization

The case id typically consists of a prefix and a generated number (for example, CASE-000000001).  This can now be further customized, using a 'CaseIdPrefix' process metadata property.  The custom case id can use a combination of CASE_PREFIX_ID, DEPLOYMENT_ID, CASE_DEFINITION_ID, and any of the case variables (passed in when starting the case).  This allows you to provide a completely custom case identifier (provided as case variable) or to generate a case id based on a combination of the provided information.
