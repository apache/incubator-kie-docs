= Tagging process variables

You can now tag the process or case variables in the process designer with additional metadata.  There are three predefined tags and custom tags that you can add too.

* required: it is mandatory to assign a value to the variable to start a process or case instance
* readonly: variable modification is not possible
* restricted: variable modification is only allowed based on implemented restriction policy (required role and identity provider)
