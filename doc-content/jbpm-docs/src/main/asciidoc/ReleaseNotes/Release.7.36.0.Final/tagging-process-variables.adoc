= Tagging process variables

Process or case variables can now be tagged in the Process Designer with additional metadata.  Three predefined tags are provided out-of-the-box but additional custom tags could be added too.

* required: it is mandatory to assign a value to that variable to start a process/case instance
* readonly: variable modification is not possible
* restricted: variable modification is only allowed based on implemented restriction policy (required role and identity provider)
