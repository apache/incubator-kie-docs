= Process Metadata support in Process Designer

A new section in the process properties allows you to define additional metadata related to the process.  Metadata is just a set of simple key-value pairs and is stored as part of the process definition. This metadata can be accessed, either from within the process or by various features, or listeners at runtime, that take that information into account.  For example, this feature can provide more customized case identifiers in the next release.
