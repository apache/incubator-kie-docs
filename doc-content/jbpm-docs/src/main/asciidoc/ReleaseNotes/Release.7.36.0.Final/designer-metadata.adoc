= Process Metadata support in Process Designer

A new section in the process properties allows you to define additional metadata related to the process.  Metadata is just a set of simple key-value pair and is stored as part of the process definition. This metadata could then be accessed, either from within the process or by various features or listeners at runtime, that could take that information into account.  For example, this feature will be used to be able to provide more customized case identifiers in the next release.
