= Variable data types

Variables specified from Business Central are now converted to the data type declared in the process definition (if not operating in  strict mode, system property `org.jbpm.variable.strict`). For backward compatibility, if the conversion fails, the string type is used, as it was done before.
Also when using jaxb marshalling for a REST invocation, passing a non int value for a int declared variable now throws an exception (it was returning 0 before)
