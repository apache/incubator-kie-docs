= Ability to access activity details in boundary events

In the BPMN modeler, you can now set a data output in the Data Output and Assignments field for a boundary event. For example, you can set `nodeInstance` as a data output variable for a boundary event, which carries the node instance details to use in a further process when the boundary event is triggered.
