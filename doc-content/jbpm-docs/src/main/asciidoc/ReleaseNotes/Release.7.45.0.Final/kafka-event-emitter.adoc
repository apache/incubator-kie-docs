= Kafka Event emitter


A new link:++#_business_application_with_elasticsearch++[EventEmitter] implementation that publish event to several topics (KafkaEventEmitter) has been defined +
As in any other emitter, there are three type of events, those related with process, tasks and cases. Each different event type will be published in a different topic once a KIE server transaction that modify any of these entities is commited. + 
Default topic names are _jbpm-processes-events_, _jbpm-tasks-events_ and _jbpm-cases-events_. They can be changed by setting a value to these system properties: _org.kie.jbpm.event.emitters.kafka.topic.processes_, _org.kie.jbpm.event.emitters.kafka.topic.cases_ and _org.kie.jbpm.event.emitters.kafka.topic.cases_ +
The events being published follows the https://github.com/cloudevents/spec[cloud event 1.0 specification].They will contain information stored in the InstanceView implementation for each different type of event: https://github.com/kiegroup/jbpm/blob/master/jbpm-persistence/jbpm-persistence-api/src/main/java/org/jbpm/persistence/api/integration/model/ProcessInstanceView.java[ProcessInstanceView], https://github.com/kiegroup/jbpm/blob/master/jbpm-persistence/jbpm-persistence-api/src/main/java/org/jbpm/persistence/api/integration/model/TaskInstanceView.java[TaskInstanceView] and https://github.com/kiegroup/jbpm/blob/master/jbpm-persistence/jbpm-persistence-api/src/main/java/org/jbpm/persistence/api/integration/model/CaseInstanceView.java[CaseInstanceView]
