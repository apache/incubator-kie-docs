= New and Noteworthy in jBPM 7.18.0

The following features were added to jBPM 7.18


== Enhanced process instance diagram view

In this release, the process diagram view has been enhanced to show extra information regarding the number of node
instances (either completed or in progress) for a specific node in the process. This new feature is displayed in form of
counter badges below each node in the process diagram view. It is also possible to toggle the badges visibility to show
 or hide it.
