= New and Noteworthy in jBPM 7.18.0

The following features were added to jBPM 7.18


== Enhanced process instance diagram view

In this release, the process diagram view has been enhanced to show extra information regarding the number of node
instances (either completed or in progress) for a specific node in the process. This new feature is displayed in form of
counter badges below each node in the process diagram view. It is also possible to toggle the badges visibility to show
 or hide it.

== Upgrade of SpringBoot to 2.1.1

jBPM 7.18 comes with long awaited SpringBoot upgrade. Business applications are now based on 2.1.1.RELEASE
of SpringBoot. All components shipped with jBPM have been tested and confirmed to work without issues after
upgrade.

NOTE: When upgrading your business application to 7.18, make sure to increase the version of spring boot as well.

== Upgrade of Hibernate to 5.3.6

Following up on the recent upgrade of the runtime (Wildfly 14), with jBPM 7.18, Hibernate has been upgraded to match
this runtime. Since Hibernate 5.3.x is already on JPA 2.2, it resulted in a split in the KIE Server `WAR` file:

* ee8 - Comes with upgraded Hibernate and targets WildFly 14+ and EAP 7.2
* ee7 - Comes with Hibernate version as in 7.17 (5.1.x) and targets environments like WAS and WLS
* webc - Comes with Hibernate 5.3.6 and targets Tomcat

Please ensure you run the right version of the war file for your runtime.

== New development mode for KIE Server

Added ability to KIE Server to start in `development mode` to provide a more fluent experience during the development
and testing phases of projects. `Development mode` provides a more flexible deployment policy for _SNAPSHOT_ modules,
allowing to update existing containers keeping the active process instances, for small changes or also allowing to reset
the container state before updating aborting active process instances for bigger changes.

Additionally to `development mode` KIE Server provides a `regular mode` to be used on productive environments that keeps
the same deployment policy it used to have since now.

It's possible to select the mode by setting the system property `org.kie.server.mode' to `regular` or `development`. If
no other configuration is provided, KIE Server will start in `development mode`.
