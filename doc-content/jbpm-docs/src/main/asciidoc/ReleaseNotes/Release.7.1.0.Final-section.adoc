= New and Noteworthy in jBPM 7.1.0

The following features were added to jBPM 7.1

== Workbench

The following are the jBPM-specific enhancements made in the workbench.

=== Quick search filters for runtime data

To allow you to quickly find data related to Process Instances, Jobs, Tasks and Errors, a new set of pre defined filters has been introduced into the related views.
These filters are always available in the "Search" tab when you first access any of the pages related to the domain mentioned above.
By default, you will notice that at least one filter is defined. That is done so that only the most relevant data is shown.
You're free to restrict the data even further by adding new filters. This can be done by either selecting values from the dropdown list or proving values to the different attributes in the input box.
You will notice that the data is filtered as you add or remove any of the active filters.

The complete list of views where quick search filters have been added include:

* Process Instances
* Tasks
* Task Administration
* Jobs
* Execution Errors

=== New error handling

The system now detects and stores execution errors, such as exceptions while running a process instance or a job once the maximum retry number has been exceeded.
The process instance list includes a new column that displays the number of errors per process instance which are not marked as acknowledged. When the column is clicked a popup is displayed, which will allow users to navigate to the new error perspective.

=== New Execution Errors View

A new view to explore and acknowledge the new generated execution error has been added.

The *Execution Errors* view shows a list of errors. It contains a 'Search' tab that provides quick search capabilities
filtered by fields like Process Instance Id, Job Id, and Type.

This view also provides a set of predefined filters: All, New (pending of acknowledgement), and Acknowledged.

You can acknowledge the unacknowledged errors by selecting the related error action. This new view also allows
 acknowledgment of multiple errors. To acknowledge multiple errors at once, select all the errors you wish to
 acknowledge and use the 'Bulk Acknowledge' button.

=== Navigation between views

New actions that allow navigation between views, have been added. This actions link an origin list view
that shows the action, and a destination list view prepared for filtering.

Basically this new navigation is composed by: a set of validations at the origin view to check if the action have to be
displayed, a group of parameter that the action pass and a predefined filter at the destination view that uses that
parameters.

The list of origin views and the new navigation allowed:

* Process Instances: view jobs, tasks and errors
* Tasks: view process instance
* Task Administration: view process instance
* Jobs : view process instance
* Execution Errors: view job, process instance and task

Over all this new actions, there is a basic validation, checking if the user has granted privileges to access to the
destination view.

=== New task admin perspective and actions

The former task list perspective has been divided into two:

** Task list perspective: Aims to be used by task operators, in order to work with their assigned (or potentially assigned) tasks.
** Task administration perspective: Designed to be used by administrators, which can manage tasks belonging to other users. This perspective is only available for users with roles **``**admin**``** and **``**process-admin**``**. It is similar to the former "Admin" filter tab on the former task list perspective.

The tasks which are displayed on the task administration perspective are determined by the current user permissions. The list shows the tasks that have the current user or the current user's group associated as business administrator. By default the system associates all tasks to the user **``**Administrator**``** (configured via the **``**org.jbpm.ht.admin.user**``** system property) and the group **``**Administrators**``** (configured via the **``**org.jbpm.ht.admin.group**``** system property), so in order to display all tasks, your **``**admin**``** or **``**process-admin**``** user needs to belong to the **``**Administrators**``** group.

IMPORTANT: Notice that the mentioned roles and group configurations are related to the KIE server's, not the Workbench's (in case they have separate user configurations).


In addition, the Suspend and Resume action buttons have been enabled on both perspectives. They are visible depending on the state of the associated task in regard to the current user.


=== Advanced Queries with ORDER BY clause

The `QueryService` used in executing advanced queries only supported sorting with ORDER BY clauses having the following pattern:

[source,sql]
----
ORDER BY Column1, Column2, ... ASC|DESC;
----

which limited the sorting to either ascending or descending for all columns.

The desired behavior, that of a full ORDER BY clause

[source,sql]
----
ORDER BY Column1 ASC|DESC, Column2 ASC|DESC, ..., ColumnN ASC|DESC;
----

allowing sort order per column, is now possible.  Please see the documentation for examples of how to apply the new full ORDER BY clause when using the QueryService.

=== Process Designer (Preview)

The new jBPM Process Designer (_Stunner_) has enhanced stability. Several bugs and issues are identified and fixed in this release.

Following is a list of new features and relevant updates:

** Re-design for some BPMN shapes and icons. The following picture shows an example BPMN process:

** Palette re-design & usability enhancements

** Improved stability, performance and design for the Diagram Explorer

** More BPMN specification support:  Inclusion of the _Embedded Subprocess_, including its own validations and constraints given by the BPMN specification

** Improved some core features of the connector. Some examples:
*** Removing a node means removing its incoming connections as well
*** Once removing a node, if the node has single incoming and outgoing connections to another nodes, the connections are being _shortcut_ into a single one
** Improved target locations for elements created using the _toolbox_. The new elements are co-located with the previous ones
** Export capabilities for the Diagram's picture. Multiple image types (like jpg or png) and PDF formats are supported
** Notifications and error messages displaying in much pretty and configurable workbench's popups
