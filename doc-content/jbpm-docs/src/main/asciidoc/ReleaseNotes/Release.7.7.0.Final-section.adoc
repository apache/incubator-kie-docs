= New and Noteworthy in jBPM 7.7.0

The following features were added to jBPM 7.7

== jBPM executor redesigned

up to version 7.7, jBPM executor used default mechanism based on polling. It periodically polls the database to check if there are any jobs to be
executed. This does not scale too good and was the main motivation to approach redesign. With version 7.7, jBPM executor is enhanced to remove polling mechanism
and instead relies on specialised ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor that respects job's priority.

This allows to have really efficient processing with less load on the database (and less locks on database). New mechanism does cover all
possible types of jobs including retries and requeues. With additional JMS trigger (that was already present since version 6.3) this provides
complete and fast asynchronous job processing solution.
To read up more on this see http://mswiderski.blogspot.com/2018/02/redesigned-jbpm-executor.html[this article] and async section in the docs.

== UserInfo interface allows to get user id by email

Small addition to UserInfo interface (and its default implementations) was provided to allow to find user id by email address. This is the reverse
operation that was already there - get email address by user id. With this, email integration (such as completing task by email) can be
easily implemented.

== Service Level Agreement (SLA) tracking for processes and cases

SLA tracking has been added to jBPM to allow to easily keep track of the execution of:

- processes
- cases
- individual activities of the process/case

This allows administrators to be always up to date with what is happening with running processes and be notified when SLA are violated.
More can be found in http://mswiderski.blogspot.com/2018/02/track-your-processes-and-activities.html[SLA overview article] and
http://mswiderski.blogspot.com/2018/02/react-to-sla-violations-in-cases.html[SLA with cases article].

== Case stages activation condition

Case stages (ad hoc subprocesses) are equipped (next to completion condition) with activation condition. This means that ad hoc stage
can be automatically activated when defined condition is met. Conditions should be defined as rule expressions and usually refer to
case file data, although are not limited to that.

== NoSQL integration

Initial integration with NoSQL (and not only that) has been introduced. This is based on additional so-called Emitters that can be
implemented to receive notifications when the {PROCESS_ENGINE} executes processes. In general, this allows users to plugin their own
emitters that will be responsible for sending data to external data stores.
Note that this is integration and not replacement of persistence layer of jBPM. You can read up more about it in
http://mswiderski.blogspot.com/2017/08/nosql-enters-jbpm-as-experiment-so-far.html[this article] and if would like to see an implementation
based on Elasticsearch, take a look at http://mswiderski.blogspot.com/2017/08/elasticsearch-empowers-jbpm.html[this article]

== jBPM Manage section redesign

The entire admin console screens have been re-designed focusing on:

** Create new layout and re-styling existent elements
** Revise *Manage Process Instances* page
** Review and improve quick filter creation
** Review and improve saved filters
** Rename top level menus


=== New layout

A new layout have been created as part of the admin console screens re-design. The new layout of jBPM Manage section
contains the following new areas:

image::ReleaseNotes/ConsoleLayout_7.7.0.png[align="center", title="Console screen new layout defined areas "]

** (1) Breadcrumb area: Contains breadcrumbs and the server configuration selector.
** (2) Filters area: Contains the dock for filter creation and dock with saved filters

The new docks are placed in the expandable panel on the left side of the screen.
The selections made inside any of the docks are immediately reflected in the table on the right.

That panels can be expanded or collapsed using the standard workbench docks controls.

image::ReleaseNotes/ConsoleItemListDocks_7.7.0.png[align="center", title="Different status of screen depending on the selected dock panel"]

** (3) Manage screen selector.

The new drop-down offers navigation to the all manage screens: Process Definitions, Process Instances, Tasks, Execution Errors
and Jobs have been created. This selector allows the user to switch process admin screens quickly and easily.

image::ReleaseNotes/ConsoleManageSelector_7.7.0.png[title="Manage screen selector"]

** (4) Toolbar area.

This toolbar has been designed to contain each screen specific actions and provides different kinds of visualizations:
icons for common actions like 'Refresh' that are self-explained, buttons for primary actions and it's prepared for containing
kebab with a list of actions.

** (5)  Filter status area.

As in previous version shows the currently applied filters and provides options to clear individual filters or to clear
them all. The new feature introduced is the ability to save the currently applied filter as a new saved filter, which
becomes available in Saved filters dock (see Filters area above)

** (6)  The list table area.

The previous table layout has been redesigned to list-like layout, matching with PatternFly guidelines.
Some of the changes that have been added:

-- New styles are applied to the different list elements.

-- The page size selector and the pagination footer has been re-styled and placed closer to the list.

-- PatternFly standards applied to list item's actions. Perform actions on individual list items using the kebab button
 control. When there are more than one available actions the kebab groups the available actions. There are different
 areas at kebab: primary actions first and separately the navigation to other screens ones

=== Revised *Manage Process Instances* page

The different management screens have been redesigned to change the way to open the item detail. When the user selects
an item by clicking on the list row to drill into the details, the item details are shown in full screen and
the primary list disappears, instead of being open in a right side panel as was in the previous versions

image::ReleaseNotes/ConsoleItemDetails_7.7.0.png[align="center", title="Item detail opened"]

Some changes have been introduced for that purpose:

** Migrated details views to full screen/adjust styling and breadcrumbs
** Moved process model pop up in process definition and instance to tab in details ( process definitions and process instances)
** Moved actions to the new layout toolbar.
** Re-styling the tabs items details to be shown in full screen mode
** Navigate back to list view using “X” close button or breadcrumbs


=== Reviewed and improved quick filter creation

The quick filter bar have been placed to the dock panel and reorganized in vertical disposition.

A new type of basic filters has been introduced to allow multiple value selection. It's using checkboxes controls to set
 the different values. The resulting restriction of selecting different values is retrieve
 the items that match with one of selected values.

image::ReleaseNotes/ConsoleItemListFilters_7.7.0.png[align="center", title="Filters dock opened"]

This new type of filter has been applied on the following fields:

** Process instances: State (Active, Aborted,..) and Errors (With errors, Without errors)
** Task: Status (Completed, Created, ..)
** Execution Errors: Type (DB, Task, Process, Job)
** Jobs: Status (Canceled, Completed,..)

=== Reviewed and improved saved filters

Different changes have been done in this area:

** Migrated filter tabs to 'Saved filters' dock, in side panel that shows the list of stored filters.
** Moved the 'Add advanced filter' that opens the previous creation filter popup, to 'Filters' dock.
** The 'Saved filters' dock allows manage the stored filters:

*** Filters can be deleted
*** The default filters can always be restored as in the previous version with the 'Restore default filters' button.
*** Filters can be applied: When a user selects one filter, that is applied on the current list and the 'Active filters'
 displays the restrictions contained in that filter.

image::ReleaseNotes/ConsoleItemListSavedFilters_7.7.0.png[align="center", title="Saved filters dock opened"]

** The user has now the ability to modify/complete filters and save it to be reused later. The new way to save filter
is selecting 'Save filters' at 'Active filters' bar. A name for the new stored filter is requested and a new filter
with the current restrictions is added to 'Saved filters' list.

It's not allowed to have filters with the same name. When the user tries to save a filter with an existing name, currently an error is shown.

image::ReleaseNotes/ConsoleItemListSavedFiltersError_7.7.0.png[align="center", title="Not allowed save filter with the same existing filter name"]


=== Reviewed Reports section design allowing to work with master / detail

The reports screen has been separated in two sections: Task reports and Process reports.

This new screens are using the new layout, The item details are opened in full screen mode too and the breadcrumb has been
added to allow the navigation and keep consistency with the other console screens.

The new layout toolbar has been filled with the action to change between dashboard and table view.

image::ReleaseNotes/ConsoleProcessReportsTable_7.7.0.png[align="center", title="New process report screen, showing items in table"]


=== Renamed top level menus

Some naming adjustments have been done to the top level menu:

** 'Task Administration' -> 'Tasks'

** 'Task List' -> 'Task Inbox'

** 'Process & Task Reports' -> two new options:  'Process Reports' and  'Task Reports'

image::ReleaseNotes/ConsoleNewTopLevelMenu_7.7.0.png[align="center", title="Updated top level menu"]


== Other specific changes on Admin console screens

=== Process Definitions

** Navigation to process instances has been placed in process definitions list.
** View 'Process model' has been placed as a new tab 'Diagram' on the process definition detail.

=== Process Instances

** View 'Process model' has been placed as a new tab 'Diagram' on the process definition detail.
** Signal and abort actions are exposed as a primary actions at new layout toolbar.

=== Task ( previously Tasks Administration)

** In the previous version Tasks were only displayed when the current user was part of the following system properties
in Kie Server: org.jbpm.ht.admin.user (default: Administrator) or org.jbpm.ht.admin.group (default: Administrators).
With the current implementation  when this criteria isn't met, this screen retrieve the list of tasks where the logged user or
any of its groups have 'Business Administrator' relationship with them.

** An error count column added to task information. Same as the error column in process instance list. Also add navigation link (View Errors).

=== Task details
** Removed 'Process Context' tab. Leaving the navigation to process instance screen at task list.
** 'Process Instance Id' and 'Process Definition Id' have been placed at 'Details' tab
** Reviewed styles on primary actions buttons
