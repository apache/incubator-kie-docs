= Inline Text Editing in process & DMN designers

Node names editing has been made more fluid with the new _Inline Editor_.
By double clicking any node it is possible to edit text directly on the nodes without floating boxes or confirmation buttons.
For applying changes just hit _“Enter”_ or click outside of the node and for canceling hit _“Esc”_, while editing.
