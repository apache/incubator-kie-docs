= Added color configuration of active asynchronous node instances color at process instance diagram

A new property `Process instance diagram active async node border color` was added in *Settings -> Process Administration* in {CENTRAL} to enable you to
change the node colors used in process instance diagrams to highlight active async node instances.

When you modify these configurations, the change is applied to all process instance diagrams in {CENTRAL}.
