= Added color configuration of active asynchronous node instances color at process instance diagram

In {CENTRAL}, a new *Process instance diagram active async node border color* property is now added in
the *Settings* -> *Process Administration* section. This property enables you to change the node colors used
in the process instance diagrams to highlight the active asynchronous node instances.

When you modify these configurations, the change is applied to all the process instance diagrams in {CENTRAL}.
