= Displays highlighted active asynchronous node instances at process instance diagrams

`The asynchronous node instances are now highlighted by changing their border color when they are created but have not been completed yet.
When an asynchronous node instance is highlighted, there are two options as follows:

* The related job is still in the progress
* The related job is failed

In both of the options, the related job is tracked in the *Jobs* section.
