= Show highlight active asynchronous node instances at process instance diagrams

Now, the asynchronous node instances are being highlighted changing their border color when they have been created but
haven't been completed yet.
When a node instance is highlighted, there are two options: The related job still is in progress or, the related job has
failed. In both cases the related job can be tracked in the 'Jobs' section.
