= MVEL expressions in assignments

MVEL expressions are now supported in assignments, in addition to already supported Xpath expressions. + 

For example, assuming that `instanceMedata` is a custom object property containing an `Address` object, this xml snippet will assign the city of that address to a variable named `output` +

[Source,xml]
----
<dataInputAssociation>
   	<targetRef>output</targetRef>
     	<assignment>
          <from xsi:type="tFormalExpression" language="http://www.mvel.org/2.0">instanceMetadata.address.city</from>
          <to>this</to>
      	</assignment>
</dataInputAssociation>

----

Please note the usage of `this` keyword inside `to` expression as an alias for `targetRef`. Note also that, if language is specified, you do not need to embed the expression between `#{}` +
