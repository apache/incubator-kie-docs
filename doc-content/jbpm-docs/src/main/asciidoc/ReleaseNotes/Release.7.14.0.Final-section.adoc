The following features were added to jBPM 7.14

== Query performance enhancements for displaying Process and Task variables in Manage section

In this release, changes have been made to enhance the performance of the underlying Kie Server queries responsible for
retrieving data about Process and Task variables.
If you're upgrading jBPM from a previous version, we encourage you to review the new table indexes that were introduced
in this release. You can review it in more details in https://github.com/kiegroup/jbpm/tree/master/jbpm-installer/src/main/resources/db/ddl-scripts[here].
