= New and Noteworthy in jBPM 7.14.0

The following features were added to jBPM 7.14

== Query performance enhancements for displaying Process and Task variables in Manage section

In this release, changes have been made to enhance the performance of the underlying Kie Server queries responsible for
retrieving data about Process and Task variables.
If you're upgrading jBPM from a previous version, we encourage you to review the new table indexes that were introduced
in this release. You can review it in more details in https://github.com/kiegroup/jbpm/tree/master/jbpm-installer/src/main/resources/db/ddl-scripts[here].

For more details on how to use these filters please refer to the following documentation:

* <<Console/ProcessManagement-section.adoc#_special_filter,Process Management variables filter>>
* <<Console/TaskManagement-section.adoc#_special_filter_in_task_inbox_and_tasks,Task Management variables filter>>

== Swagger documentation for {CONTROLLER} REST API

This release includes enhanced documentation about the {CONTROLLER} REST API.
You can access this documentation by running the {HEADLESS_CONTROLLER} `.war` application or {CENTRAL} (which contains a built-in {CONTROLLER}).
Both applications will allow you to explore the available endpoints by accessing the `/docs` context.
Example: `http://localhost:8080/controller/docs` or `http://localhost:8080/jbpm-console/docs`.

A static version of the API is also available at http://jbpm.org/learn/documentation.html[jbpm.org].
