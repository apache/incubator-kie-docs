= New and Noteworthy in jBPM 6.2.0


The following features were added to the jBPM core on top of 6.1.

== jBPM services


jBPM services modules have been significantly refactored to provide clear separation between the logic they bring and various frameworks that can be used to consume those services.
With version 6.2 following modules are available:



* jbpm-services-api - clear services api that shall be used by any client code that consumes services
* jbpm-kie-services - core implementation of the services that do not have any framework specific code (e.g. CDI)
* jbpm-services-cdi - CDI specific code on top of jbpm-kie-services
* jbpm-services-ejb-api - ejb related extensions to services api - mainly to provide remote capablities for the interfaces
* jbpm-services-ejb-impl - ejb specific code on top of jbpm-kie-services
* jbpm-services-ejb-client - ejb client implementation to interact with services over remote ejb invocation - currently JBoss specific implementation available
* jbpm-service-ejb-timer - ejb timer service backed by JEE timer service provided by container

jBPM services are intended to be base of execution server (regardless of what framework is used to build it up completely) so should be considered as first choice when enbedding jbpm in custom applications.
With 6.2 capabilities it already provides support for most common frameworks used - CDI, EJB, Spring (should simply rely on core implementation). See http://mswiderski.blogspot.com/2014/11/cross-framework-services-in-jbpm-62.html[this article] for details and example.

== Process engine extensions

. Lazy initialization of runtime engine components by RuntimeManager to make runtime engine creation lightweight 
+ 
RuntimeEngine has been enhanced to lazy initialize its components (KieSession, TaskService, AuditService) to improve overall performance of retriveing RuntimeEngine instances from RuntimeManager.
. Life cycle management for work item handlers and event listeners 
+ 
Handler and listeners can implement additional interface to be managed by runtime engine, see <<_sec.workitemhandler.overview,work item handler life cycle
management>> for more details.
. Deployments are now by default stored in data base (as deployment descriptors) to servive server restarts
+ 
Prior to verion 6.2 deployments that were handled by DeploymentService implementation were not persisted so they required to be handled separately - in case of kie-workbench they were stored inside system.git repo.
With version 6.2 deployment service will persist that information directly into db which will make it easier in many cases including clustering as it will not require VFS clustering (Zookeeper and Helix) setup.
. Extension to deployment descriptor to specify classes (by FQCN) that should be added to JAXB context for remote interfaces interaction 
+ 
Deployment descriptor accept new set of elements 
+
[source]
----
<remoteable-classes>
   ...
   <remotable-class>org.jbpm.test.CustomClass</remotable-class>
   ...
</remoteable-classes>
----
. Classpath scanning for classes to be included in JAXB context for remote interfaces interaction
+ 
Classes annotated with javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlRootElement and org.kie.api.remote.Remotable will be automatically added to JAXB context of given deployment as soon as they are defined as project dependency.
At the same time all classes included in project itself are also added to deployment's JAXB context.
. jbpm executor has been enhanced to provide support for: 
+
** requeue failed jobs so they can be executed once the error that caused them to is resolved. 
** reoccuring jobs that allows single definition to be repeatedly invoked based on time intervals, e.g. daily jobs to clean up history log tables. See http://mswiderski.blogspot.com/2014/12/keep-your-jbpm-environment-healthy.html[this article] for details and example.
. CRON support for intermediate and boundary timer events
. Enhanced support for multi instance activities to support completion condition as MVEL expression



== OSGi


While a number of core jars were OSGi-ready (in v5 already), a significant number of additional jars were now added to this list, including for example the human task service, the runtime managers, full persistence, etc.
As a result, full core engine functionality is now available on top of OSGi.
Specific extensions and tests showing it in action are available for Apache Karaf and Aries Blueprint (in the droolsjbpm-integration repository). 

== Camel handler


A new out-of-the-box service task has been implemented for using Apache Camel to connect a process to the outside world using some of the numerous Camel endpoint URIs.
The service task allows you to for example specify how to pass data to an FTP endpoint by configuring properties such as hostname, port, username, payload, etc.
for some common endpoints like (S)FTP, File, JMS, XSLT, etc.
but you can use virtually any of the available endpoints by defining the URI yourself (http://camel.apache.org/uris.html). 

== Form Modeler improvements


Support for JavaScript code:

* Added field property on simple fields to allow the user to add JavaScript code on the onchange event. This will allow the user to add richer functionallities on the forms.
* Simplified the autogenerated field id's in order to allow the user to access the inputs directly via JavaScript.


New field types:

* Added configurable ComboBox and RadioGroup fields. This new fields types allow the user to add ComboBoxes and Radio Button groups selecting their data source from the list of the Sources registered on the application.
* Added support to simple types Lists (java.util.List<String>, java.util.List<Integer>, java.util.List<Long>...). This fields allow the user to upload multiple basic values (strings, numbers, dates and booleans) storing them on java.util.List
