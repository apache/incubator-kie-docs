= New and Noteworthy in jBPM 7.17.0

The following features were added to jBPM 7.17


== Enhanced capabilities for managing node and timer instances using the process instance diagram view

In this release, the process diagram view has been enhanced to offer new capabilities for visualizing and managing node
and timer information. By default, information about all node and timer instances are displayed in the new side panel.
By expanding each instance, users can access extra details like id, start and updated time, and SLA status.
For active timer instance, users can also view specific details such as the last and next activation
time, as well as the delay and activation time. Apart from displaying information, users are now also able to execute
certain operations on each of the nodes and timers, which includes:

* Trigger a specific node.
* Cancel a node instance.
* Retrigger a node instance.
* Reschedule a timer instance.

A context menu is available for nodes and timers that allow operations to be executed.

The process diagram viewer has also been enhanced allowing users to easily control the zoom level on the process image.
Furthermore, it is also possible for users to interactively select nodes in the diagram image to filter down the nodes panel
on the left for a more specific visualization of the node data.

== Service task repository integrated with Business Central

Service task repository (aka work item repository) has been integrated into Business Central. It provides two areas
to manage service tasks

* Global administration - accessible via settings page with dedicated `Service Task Administration` tile
* Project level management - accessible via project settings

Global administration allows process administrators to define what service tasks can be used within projects
by either enabling or disabling them. Most of service tasks available in repository are disabled by
default except those that come with jBPM out of the box e.g. REST, Email, Decision, Business rule.

Administrators can also upload custom service tasks to make them available for projects.

Project level management allows to install given service task into the project. Installation consists of

* updating project dependencies (modifies pom.xml of the project)
* updating deployment descriptor - registers work item handler for the service task
* installs icon and work definition file into project resources (global area)

== Docker service task

jbpm work items have been equipped to provide several service tasks to interact with docker

* Create container
* Inspect container
* Kill container
* List containers
* Start container
* Stop container
* List images

These can be used directly by taking advantage of service task repository integrated into Business Central.

== VS Code Extension for jBPM Business Applications
