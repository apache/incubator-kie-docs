= New and Noteworthy in jBPM 7.17.0

The following features were added to jBPM 7.17


== Enhanced capabilities for managing node and timer instances using the process instance diagram view

In this release, the process diagram view has been enhanced to offer new capabilities for visualizing and managing node
and timer information. By default, information about all node and timer instances are displayed in the new side panel.
By expanding each instance, users can access extra details like id, start and updated time, and SLA status.
For active timer instance, users can also view specific details such as the last and next activation
time, as well as the delay and activation time. Apart from displaying information, users are now also able to execute
certain operations on each of the nodes and timers, which includes:

* Trigger a specific node.
* Cancel a node instance.
* Retrigger a node instance.
* Reschedule a timer instance.

A context menu is available for nodes and timers that allow operations to be executed.

The process diagram viewer has also been enhanced allowing users to easily control the zoom level on the process image.
Furthermore, it is also possible for users to interactively select nodes in the diagram image to filter down the nodes panel
on the left for a more specific visualization of the node data.
