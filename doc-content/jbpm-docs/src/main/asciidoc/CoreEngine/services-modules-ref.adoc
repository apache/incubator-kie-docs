= Modules for {PROCESS_ENGINE} services

The {PROCESS_ENGINE} services are provided as a set of modules. These modules are grouped by their framework dependencies. You can choose the suitable modules and use only these modules, without making your application dependent on the frameworks that other modules use.

The following modules are available:

* `jbpm-services-api`: Only API classes and interfaces
* `jbpm-kie-services`: A code implementation of the services API in pure Java without any framework dependencies
* `jbpm-services-cdi`: A CDI wrapper on top of the core services implementation
* `jbpm-services-ejb-api`: An extension to the services API to support EJB requirements
* `jbpm-services-ejb-impl`: EJB wrappers on top of the core services implementation
* `jbpm-services-ejb-timer`: A scheduler service based on the EJB timer service to support time based operations, such as timer events and deadlines
* `jbpm-services-ejb-client`: An EJB remote client implementation, currently supporting only {EAP}
