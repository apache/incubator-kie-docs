= `KieRuntimeLogger` event listener

The `KieServices` package contains the `KieRuntimeLogger` event listener that you can add to your session. You can use this listener  to create an audit log. This log contains all the different events that occurred at runtime.

[NOTE]
====
These loggers are intended for debugging purposes. They might be too detailed for business-level process analysis. 
====

The listener implements the following logger types:

* Console logger: This logger writes out all the events to the console. The fully qualified class name for this logger is `org.drools.core.audit.WorkingMemoryConsoleLogger`.
* File logger: This logger writes out all the events to a file using an XML representation. You can use the log file in an IDE to generate a tree-based visualization of the events that occurred during execution. The fully qualified class name for this logger is `org.drools.core.audit.WorkingMemoryFileLogger`.
+
The file logger writes the events to disk only when closing the logger or when the number of events in the logger reaches a predefined level. Therefore, it is not suitable for debugging processes at runtime.
* Threaded file logger: This logger writes the events to a file after a specified time interval. You can use this logger to visualize the progress in real time while debugging processes. The fully qualified class name for this logger is `org.drools.core.audit.ThreadedWorkingMemoryFileLogger`.

When creating a logger, you must pass the KIE session as an argument. The file loggers also require the name of the log file to be created. The threaded file logger requires the interval in milliseconds after which the events are saved.

Always close the logger at the end of your application.

The following example shows the use of the file logger.

[source,java,subs="attributes+"]
----

  import org.kie.api.KieServices;
  import org.kie.api.logger.KieRuntimeLogger;
  ...
  KieRuntimeLogger logger = KieServices.Factory.get().getLoggers().newFileLogger(ksession, "test");
  // add invocations to the {PROCESS_ENGINE} here,
  // e.g. ksession.startProcess(processId);
  ...
  logger.close();
----

The log file that is created by the file-based loggers contains an XML-based overview of all the events that occurred during the runtime of the process. You can use the _Audit View_ in the _Drools Eclipse plugin_ to open the file and visualize the events as a tree. Events that occur between the `before` and `after` calls of an event are shown as children of that event.

The following screenshot shows a simple example. A process is started, resulting in the activation of the Start node, an Action node, and an End node, after which the process is completed.
