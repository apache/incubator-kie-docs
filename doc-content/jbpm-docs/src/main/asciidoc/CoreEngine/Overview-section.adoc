= Overview

This chapter introduces the API you need to load processes and execute them.
For more detail on how to define the processes themselves, check out the chapter on BPMN 2.0. 

To interact with the process engine (for example, to start a process), you need to set up a session.
This session will be used to communicate with the process engine.
A session needs to have a reference to a knowledge base, which contains a reference to all the relevant process definitions.
This knowledge base is used to look up  the process definitions whenever necessary.
To create a session, you first need to create a knowledge base, load all the necessary process definitions (this can be from various sources, like from classpath, file system or process repository) and then instantiate a session.

Once you have set up a session, you can use it to start executing processes.
Whenever a process is started, a new process instance is created (for that process definition) that maintains the state of that specific instance of the process.

For example, imagine you are writing an application to process sales orders.
You could then define one or more process definitions that define how the order should be processed.
When starting up your application, you first need to create a knowledge base that contains those process definitions.
You can then create a session based on this knowledge base so that, whenever a new sales order comes in, a new process instance is started for that sales order.
That process instance contains the state of the process for that specific sales request.

A knowledge base can be shared across sessions and usually is only created once, at the start of the application (as creating a knowledge base can be rather heavy-weight as it involves parsing and compiling the process definitions).  Knowledge bases can be dynamically changed (so you can add or remove processes at runtime).

Sessions can be created based on a knowledge base and are used to execute processes and interact with the engine.
You can create as many independent session as you need and creating a session is considered relatively lightweight.
How many sessions you create is up to you.
In general, most simple cases start out with creating one session that is then called from various places in your application.
You could decide to create multiple sessions if for example you want to have multiple independent processing units (for example, if you want all processes from one customer to be completely independent from processes for another customer, you could create an independent session for each customer) or if you need multiple sessions for scalability reasons.
If you don't know what to do, simply start by having one knowledge base that contains all your process definitions and create one session that you then use to execute all your processes.

The jBPM project has a clear separation between the API the users should be interacting with and the actual implementation classes.
The public API exposes most of the features we believe "normal" users can safely use and should remain rather stable across releases.
Expert users can still access internal classes but should be aware that they should know what they are doing and that the internal API might still change in the future.

As explained above, the jBPM API should thus be used to (1) create a knowledge base that contains your process definitions, and to (2) create a session to start new process instances, signal existing ones, register listeners, etc.
