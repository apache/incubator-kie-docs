= KieBase

The jBPM API allows you to first create a KIE base.
This KIE base should include all your process definitions that might need to be executed by that session.
To create a KIE base, use a KieHelper to load processes from various resources (for example from the classpath or from the file system), and then create a new KIE base from that helper.
The following code snippet shows how to create a KIE base consisting of only one process  definition (using in this case a resource from the classpath).

[source,java]
----

  KieHelper kieHelper = new KieHelper();
  KieBase kieBase = kieHelper
                    .addResource(ResourceFactory.newClassPathResource("MyProcess.bpmn"))
                    .build();
----

The ResourceFactory has similar methods to load files from file system, from URL, InputStream, Reader, etc.

This is considered manual creation of KIE base and while it is simple it is not recommended for real application development but more for try outs.
Following you'll find recommended and much more powerful way of building KIE base, KIE session and more - RuntimeManager.
