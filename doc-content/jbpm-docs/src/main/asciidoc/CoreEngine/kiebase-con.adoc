= KIE base

The KIE base includes all process definitions and other assets that your application might need to execute a business process.

To create a KIE base, use a `KieHelper` instance to load processes from various resources, such as the class path or the file system, and to create a new KIE base.

The following code snippet shows how to create a KIE base consisting of only one process  definition, which is loaded from the class path.

.Creating a KIE base containing one process definition
[source,java]
----

  KieHelper kieHelper = new KieHelper();
  KieBase kieBase = kieHelper
    .addResource(ResourceFactory.newClassPathResource("MyProcess.bpmn"))
    .build();
----

The `ResourceFactory` class has similar methods to load resources from a file, a URL, an InputStream, a Reader, and other sources.

[NOTE]
====
This "manual" process of creating a KIE base is simpler than other alternatives, but can make an application hard to maintain. Use other methods of creating a KIE base, such as the `RuntimeManager` class or the Services API, for applications that you expect to develop and maintain over long periods of time.
