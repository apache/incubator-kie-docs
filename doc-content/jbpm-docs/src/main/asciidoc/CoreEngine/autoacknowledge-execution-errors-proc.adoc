= Auto-acknowledging execution errors

By default, execution errors are unacknowledged when they occur. To avoid the need to acknowledge every execution error manually, you can configure jobs to auto-acknowledge some or all execution errors.

[NOTE]
====
If you configure an auto-acknowledge job, the job runs every day by default. To auto-acknowledge execution errors only once, set the `SingleRun` parameter to `true`.

.Procedure

. In {CENTRAL}, select *Menu* -> *Manage* -> *Jobs*.
. In the top right of the screen, click *New Job*.
. Enter any identifier for the job in the *Business Key* field.
. In the *Type* field, enter the type of the auto-acknowledge job:
** `org.jbpm.executor.commands.error.JobAutoAckErrorCommand`: Acknowledge all execution errors of type `Job` where the job to which the error relates is now cancelled, completed, or rescheduled for another execution.
** `org.jbpm.executor.commands.error.TaskAutoAckErrorCommand`: Acknowledge all execution errors of type `Task` where the task to which the error relates is in an exit state (completed, failed, exited, obsolete).
** `org.jbpm.executor.commands.error.ProcessAutoAckErrorCommand`: Acknowledge all execution errors of any type where the process instance from which the error originates is already finished (completed or aborted), or the task from which the error originates is already finished.
+
. Select a *Due On* time for the job to be completed:
** To run the job immediately, select the `Run now` option.
** To run the job at a specific time, select `Run later`. A date and time field appears next to the `Run later` option. Click the field to open the calendar and schedule a specific time and date for the job.

.. Click the *Advanced* tab.
.. Click the *Add Parameter* button.
.. Enter the configuration parameter you want to apply to the job:
*** If you want the job to run only once, add the `SingleRun` parameter with the value of `true`.
*** If you want he job to run periodically, add the `NextRun` parameter with the value of a valid time expression, such as `2h`, `5d`, `1m`, and so on.
+
.. Optional: To set a custom entity manager factory name, enter the `EmfName` parameter.
