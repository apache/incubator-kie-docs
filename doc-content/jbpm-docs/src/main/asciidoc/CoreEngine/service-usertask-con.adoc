== User Task Service

The user task service covers the complete lifecycle of an individual task, and you can use the service to manage a user task from start to end.

Task queries are not a part of the user task service. Use the runtime data service to query for tasks. Use the user task service for scoped operations on one task, including the following actions:

* Modification of selected properties
* Access to task variables
* Access to task attachments
* Access to task comments

The user task service is also a command executor. You can use it to execute custom task commands.

The following example shows starting a process and interacting with a task in the process:

long processInstanceId =
processService.startProcess(deployUnit.getIdentifier(), "org.jbpm.writedocument");

List<Long> taskIds =
runtimeDataService.getTasksByProcessInstanceId(processInstanceId);

Long taskId = taskIds.get(0);

userTaskService.start(taskId, "john");
UserTaskInstanceDesc task = runtimeDataService.getTaskById(taskId);

Map<String, Object> results = new HashMap<String, Object>();
results.put("Result", "some document data");
userTaskService.complete(taskId, "john", results);
