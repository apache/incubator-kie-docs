= Supported KIE core API packages and classes

The {KIE_SERVER} Java client API is part of a wide range of packages and classes for interacting with {KIE_SERVER} from your Java application.

The following are some of the commonly used interfaces that you can use with the Java client API:

* `org.kie.api.KieBase`: Used to access knowledge definitions in the KIE base.
* `org.kie.api.runtime.KieSession`: Used to interact with the {ENGINE}.
* `org.kie.api.runtime.StatelessKieSession`: Used to apply stateless KIE session functions on an execution, such as `dispose()` and `fireAllRules`.
* `org.kie.api.runtime.KieContainer`: Used to interact with all KIE bases in a given KIE module.
* `org.kie.api.builder.ReleaseId`: Used to access the full GAV (group ID, artifact ID, and version) data of a resource.
* `org.kie.api.builder.KieScanner`: Used to detect new releases of a given KIE module and its dependencies.

Factory classes with static methods provide instances of these interfaces. The Java API uses a pluggable-provider approach to allow provider implementations to be connected to the factories at run time.

The following are commonly used factory classes that you can use with the Java client API:

* `org.kie.api.KieServices`: Used to access Java client services to interact with KIE containers and business assets in {KIE_SERVER}.
* `org.kie.api.command.KieCommands`: Used to execute runtime commands on {KIE_SERVER}.
* `org.kie.api.io.KieResources`: Used to provide resource implementations for the desired IO resource.

For the full list and descriptions of all supported API packages and classes in the {KIE_SERVER} Java client API, see the http://docs.jboss.org/drools/release/latestFinal/kie-api-javadoc/[KIE Public API] Javadoc page.
