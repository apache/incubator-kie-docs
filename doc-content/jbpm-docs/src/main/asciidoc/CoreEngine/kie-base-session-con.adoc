= KIE base and KIE session

A _KIE base_ contains a reference to all process definitions and other assets relevant for a process. The engine uses this KIE base to look up all information for the process, or for several processes, whenever necessary.

You can load assets into a KIE base from various sources, such as a class path, file system, or process repository. Creating a KIE base is a resource-heavy operation, as it involves loading and parsing assets from various sources. You can dynamically modify the KIE base to add or remove process definitions and other assets at run time.

After you create a KIE base, you can instantiate a _KIE session_ based on this KIE base. Use this KIE session to run processes based on the definitions in the KIE base.

When you use the KIE session to start a process, a new _process instance_ is created. This instance maintains a specific process  state. Different instances in the same KIE session can use the same process definition but have different states.

For example, if you develop an application to process sales orders, you can define one or more process definitions that determine how an order should be processed. When starting the application, you first need to create a KIE base that contains those process definitions. You can then create a session based on this KIE base. When a new sales order comes in, start a new process instance for the order. This process instance contains the state of the process for the specific sales request.

You can create many KIE sessions for the same KIE base and you can create many instances of the process within the same KIE session. Creating a KIE session, and also creating a process instance within the KIE session, uses far fewer resources than creating a KIE base. If you modify a KIE base, all the KIE sessions that use it can use the modifications automatically.

In most simple use cases, you can use a single KIE session to execute all processes. You can also use several sessions if needed. For example, if you want order processing for different customers to be completely independent, you can create a KIE session for each customer. You can also use multiple sessions for scalability reasons.

In typical applications you do not need to create a KIE base or KIE session directly. However, when you use other levels of the {PROCESS_ENGINE} API, you can interact with elements of the API that this level defines.
