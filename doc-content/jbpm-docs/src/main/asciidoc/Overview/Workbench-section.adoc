= {CENTRAL}

The {CENTRAL} web-based application covers the complete life cycle of BPM projects starting at authoring phase, going through implementation, execution and monitoring.
It combines a series web-based tools into one configurable solution to manage all assets and runtime data needed for the business solution.

It supports the following:

* A repository service to store your business processes and related artifacts, using a Git repository, which supports versioning, remote Git access (as a file system) and access via REST.
* A web-based user interface to manage your business processes, targeted towards business users; it also supports the visualization (and editing) of your artifacts (the web-based editors like designer, data and form modeler are integrated here), but also categorisation,  build and deployment, etc..
* Collaboration features which enable multiple actors (for example business users and developers) to work together on the same project.
