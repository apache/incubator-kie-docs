= Data objects

Data objects are the building blocks for the rule assets that you create. Data objects are custom data types implemented as Java objects in specified packages of your project. For example, you might create a `Person` object with data fields `Name`, `Address`, and `DateOfBirth` to specify personal details for loan application rules. These custom data types determine what data your assets and your decision services are based on.
