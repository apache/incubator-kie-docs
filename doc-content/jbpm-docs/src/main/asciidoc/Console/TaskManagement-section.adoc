= Tasks Management

This chapter introduces the Task Management screens and the its integration with the Form Modeller component to allow users to work on their assigned tasks.
You can find the source code of these screens https://github.com/kiegroup/jbpm-wb/tree/master/jbpm-wb-human-tasks[here].
Feel free to report issues, send Pull Requests and get in contact with the team via comments in github.
At the end of this section you will find a technical description about how to customize these views.

Designed to be used by task and business process administrators, which can manage tasks belonging to other users and see
extra task management data like related execution errors.


The Task management is available in the main menu under *Manage* then *Tasks*:

In this screen the management screens selector is included to allow to navigate to the other management screens described
in Process Instance List section.
In this list there is a column showing the related errors, that in case there are any related execution errors allow
to navigate to them.

By default, this page is only available for users with workbench roles **``**admin**``** and **``**process-admin**``**.

=== Tasks visible to the current user

The tasks which are displayed on the tasks page are determined by the current user permissions.
When the user has been declared (via system property) as 'task admin user' or belongs to the tasks administrators group,
this list shows all tasks.
Otherwise, if the user is not declared as a business administrator, this list will show only the tasks where the user
have been declared business process administrator.

IMPORTANT: By default the system associates all tasks to the user **``**Administrator**``** (configured via the **``**org.jbpm.ht.admin.user**``** system property)
and the group **``**Administrators**``** (configured via the **``**org.jbpm.ht.admin.group**``** system property), so in
 order to display all tasks, your **``**admin**``** or **``**process-admin**``** user needs to belong to the **``**Administrators**``** group.

IMPORTANT: Notice that the mentioned roles and group configurations are related to the KIE server's, not the Workbench's (in case they have separate user configurations).

== Task Inbox

This screen not belongs to the management group, but have been designed following the same patterns but for being used,
 by any user (not administrator) to track the tasks. For this reason, the management screens selector is not included.

Every user with access to the platform will have access to its personal task inbox where tasks assigned to him/her will be displayed.
Each user will be able to create its own personal tasks or work on tasks that were create as a result of a business process execution.

You can access to the user Task List accessing *Tasks Inbox* main menu:

=== Tasks visible to the current user (Personal and Group Tasks)

Pending tasks for each user will be displayed in their task list screen.
Notice that you will not be able to see assigned tasks from another user different from the one that is currenlty logged in.

The list will show all the tasks that match with the defined restrictions ordered by the columns presented.
You can change the default ordering clicking on the column header.
This view offer a more traditional BPM Task List view where you can sort the data based on different columns.

Here appears again the concept of view versus just filtering as we explained in the process instante list.
The default filters have the following restrictions over the tasks to show:

* *Active:* all the Active tasks that user can work on.
  That means Personal and Group Tasks.
* *Personal:* all the personal tasks that already belong to the user. 
* *Group:* all the group tasks that needs to be claimed by the user in order to start working on them.
  It will show completed tasks as well with the exception of completed tasks that belongs to a process that is already finished.
  In such cases the tasks are cleaned up after the process is completed and for that reason they will not be displayed.

==== Specific actions in Tasks Inbox.

The user can perform the following specific action over the task:

** Task available actions depending on it's status: Claim, release,..
** Navigate to related processInstance


[NOTE]
====
The user can always restore the default filters selecting the option 'Restore default filters' on Saved filters dock
====

=== Task Details

You can access to the Task Details by clicking in a task row.
The details associated with a task can be changed, like for example the Due Date, the Priority or the task description.


image::Console/task-details.png[]

The task details appear in a new region with different sections that allow view the task associated information: 

*Work* In this tab the associated form is displayed if the task has one.
In this section is where the user can interact with the process, executing the available actions in each moment. 

*Details* Here the basic task data is accessible: priority, status, description, data related with the process instance
 associated.

*Assignments* The Task Assignments tab allows you to delegate the task to another person or group if you are not able to continue working on it.

*Comments* You can also add while you are working on a task comments about the progress.

=== Work on a Task

Tasks can have associated a Form to store data.
If tasks are part of a Business Process, usually some data needs to be collected and propagated to the business process for further usage.
For that reason, tasks has to provide a way to gather and store data.
Forms can be created for specific tasks using the Form Modeller.
If no form is provided a dynamic form will be created based on the information that the task needs to handle.

=== Task Forms generated by the Form Modeller

As part of your projects you can model your forms for your human tasks,  providing a rich interface for collecting data.
This shows the Form Modeller canvas while designing the previously Task Form.

=== Available actions for a Task.

The user can perform the following specific action over the task:

** Task available actions depending on it's status: Claim, release,..
** Navigate to related processInstance
** In case there are related errors, like at the process instance list, navigate to them.

== Special filter in Task Inbox and Tasks

As was explained in the process instance list, this screen have been designed as a Console Management list view,
providing the content to the 'Filter' and 'Saved Filters' docks working over task items.

The user can create a specific filter that provides domain specific columns to be added to a task list.
When the user creates a custom filter for a specific task name the task variables are enabled as columns.

.Basic available columns that every task list allows select to be displayed.

The custom filter that activates the capability to display task variables as columns is set a filter with the restriction Name="taskName".

.Filter by task name creation

When the filter with the restriction over a specific task name is applied, the task associated variables appear as a selectable columns, to the task list.
