= Process Instance State


jBPM allows the persistent storage of certain information.
This chapter describes these different types of persistence and how to configure them.
An example of the information stored is the process runtime state.
Storing the process runtime state is necessary in order to be able to continue execution of a process instance at any point, if something goes wrong.
Also, the process definitions themselves, and the history information (logs of current and previous process states) can also be persisted.

== Runtime State


Whenever a process is started, a process instance is created, which represents the execution of the process in that specific context.
For example, when executing a process that specifies how to process a sales order, one process instance is created for each sales request.
The process instance represents the current execution state in that specific context, and contains all the information related to that process instance.
Note that it only contains the (minimal) runtime state that is needed to continue the execution of that process instance at some later time, but it does not include information about the history of that process instance if that information is no longer needed in the process instance.

The runtime state of an executing process can be made persistent, for example, in a database.
This allows to restore the state of execution of all running processes in case of unexpected failure, or to temporarily remove running instances from memory and restore them at some later time.
jBPM allows you to plug in different persistence strategies.
By default, if you do not configure the process engine otherwise, process instances are not made persistent.

If you configure the engine to use persistence, it will automatically store the runtime state into the database.
You do not have to trigger persistence yourself, the engine will take care of this when persistence is enabled.
Whenever you invoke the engine, it will make sure that any changes are stored at the end of that invocation, at so-called safe points.
Whenever something goes wrong and you restore the engine from the database, you also should not reload the process instances and trigger them manually to resume execution, as process instances will automatically resume execution if they are triggered, like for example by a timer expiring, the completion of a task that was  requested by that process instance, or a signal being sent to the process instance.
The engine will automatically reload process instances on demand.

The runtime persistence data should in general be considered internal, meaning that you probably should not try to access these database tables directly and especially not try to modify these directly (as changing the runtime state of process instances without the engine knowing might have unexpected side-effects).  In most cases where information about the current execution state of process instances is required, the use of a history log is mostly recommended (see below).  In some cases, it might still be useful to for example query the internal database tables directly, but you should only do this if you know what you are doing.

=== Binary Persistence


jBPM uses a binary persistence mechanism, otherwise known as marshalling, which converts the state of the process instance into a binary dataset.
When you use persistence with jBPM, this  mechanism is used to save or retrieve the process instance state  from the database.
The same mechanism is also applied to the  session state and any work item states.

When the process instance state is persisted, two things happen:

* First, the process instance information is transformed  into a binary blob. For performance reasons, a custom serialization  mechanism is used and not normal Java serialization.
* This blob is then stored, alongside other metadata about  this process instance. This metadata includes, among other things,  the process instance id, process id, and the process start date.

Apart from the process instance state, the session itself can  also store some state, such as the state of timer jobs, or the session  data that any business rules would be evaluated over.
This session state is stored separately as a binary blob, along with  the id of the session and some metadata.
You can always restore session  state by reloading the session with the given id.
The session id can  be retrieved using ``ksession.getId()``.

Note that the process instance binary datasets are usually  relatively small, as they only contain the minimal execution state  of the process instance.
For a simple process instance, this usually  contains one or a few node instances, i.e., any node that is currently  executing, and any existing variable values.

As a result of jBPM using marshalling, the data model is both  simple and small.

=== Safe Points

The state of a process instance is stored at so-called "safe points" during the execution of the process engine.
Whenever a process instance is executing (for example when it started or continuing from a previous wait state, the engine executes the process instance until no more actions can be performed (meaning that the process instance either has completed (or was aborted), or that it has reached a wait state in all of its parallel paths). At that point, the engine has reached the next safe state, and the state of the process instance (and all other process instances that might have been affected) is stored persistently.
