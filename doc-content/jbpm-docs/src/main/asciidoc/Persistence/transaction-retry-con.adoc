[id='transaction-retry-con_{context}']
= Transaction retries

When the {PROCESS_ENGINE} commits a transaction, sometimes the commit operation fails because another transaction is being committed at the same time. In this case, the {PROCESS_ENGINE} must retry the transaction.

If several retries fail, the transaction fails permanently.

You can use JVM system properties to control the retrying process.
