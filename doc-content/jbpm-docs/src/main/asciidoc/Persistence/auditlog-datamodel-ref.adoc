[id='auditlog-datamodel-ref_{context}']
= The {PROCESS_ENGINE} audit log data model

You can query {PROCESS_ENGINE} audit log information to use it in different scenarios, for example, creating a history log for one specific process instance or analyzing the performance of all instances of a specific process.

The audit log data model is a default implementation. Depending on your use cases, you might also define your own data model for storing the information you require. You can use process event listeners to extract the information.

The data model contains three entities: one for process instance information, one for node instance information, and one for process variable instance information.

The `ProcessInstanceLog` table contains the basic log information about a process instance.
