= Configuration of persistence in the {PROCESS_ENGINE}

If you use the {PROCESS_ENGINE} without configuring any persistence, it does not save runtime data to any database; no im-memory database is available by default. You can use this mode if it is required for performance reasons or when you want to manage persistence yourself.

To use JPA persistence in the {PROCESS_ENGINE}, you must configure it.

Configuration usually requires adding the necessary dependencies, configuring a data source, and creating the {PROCESS_ENGINE} with persistence configured.
