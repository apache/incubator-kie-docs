= Transactions in the {PROCESS_ENGINE}

The {PROCESS_ENGINE} supports Java Transaction API (JTA) transactions.

ifdef::JBPM,DROOLS,OP[]
It also supports local transactions _only_ when using Spring. For more information about using Spring to set up persistence, please  see the Spring chapter in the Drools integration guide.
endif::JBPM,DROOLS,OP[]
The current version of the {PROCESS_ENGINE} does not support pure local transactions. 

If you do not provide transaction boundaries inside your application, the {PROCESS_ENGINE} automatically executes each method invocation on the {PROCESS_ENGINE} in a separate transaction. 

Optionally, you can specify the transaction boundaries in the application code, for example, to combine multiple commands into one transaction.
