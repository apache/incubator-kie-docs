= Configuration


By default, the {PROCESS_ENGINE} does not save runtime data persistently.
This means you can use the {PROCESS_ENGINE} completely without persistence (so not even requiring an in memory database) if necessary, for example for performance reasons, or when you would like to manage persistence yourself.
It is, however, possible to configure the {PROCESS_ENGINE} to use persistence by configuring it to do so.
This usually requires adding the necessary dependencies, configuring a data source, and creating the {PROCESS_ENGINE} with persistence configured.

== Adding dependencies


You need to make sure the necessary dependencies are available in the classpath of your application if you want to user persistence.
By default, persistence is based on the Java Persistence API (JPA) and can thus work with several persistence mechanisms.
We are using Hibernate by default.

If you're using the Eclipse IDE and the jBPM Eclipse plugin, you should make sure the necessary JARs are added to your jBPM runtime directory.
You don't really need to do anything (as the necessary dependencies should already be there) if you are using the jBPM runtime that is configured by default when using the jBPM installer, or if you downloaded and unzipped the jBPM runtime artifact (from the downloads) and pointed the jBPM plugin to that directory.

If you would like to manually add the necessary dependencies to your project, you need to put the [path]_jbpm-persistence-jpa.jar_ on your project's classpath as that contains the code for saving the runtime state whenever necessary.
Depending on the persistence solution and database you are using, you may need additional dependencies.

For the default combination of:

* Hibernate as the JPA persistence provider
* H2 in-memory database
* Narayana for JTA-based transaction management
* Tomcat DBCP for connection pooling capabilities

The following additional dependencies are required:

* jbpm-persistence-jpa (org.jbpm)
* drools-persistence-jpa (org.drools)
* persistence-api (javax.persistence)
* hibernate-entitymanager (org.hibernate)
* hibernate-annotations (org.hibernate)
* hibernate-commons-annotations (org.hibernate)
* hibernate-core (org.hibernate)
* commons-collections (commons-collections)
* dom4j (org.dom4j)
* jta (javax.transaction)
* narayana-jta (org.jboss.narayana.jta)
* tomcat-dbcp (org.apache.tomcat)
* jboss-transaction-api_1.2_spec (org.jboss.spec.javax.transaction)
* javassist (javassist)
* slf4j-api (org.slf4j)
* slf4j-jdk14 (org.slf4j)
* simple-jndi (simple-jndi)
* h2 (com.h2database)
* jbpm-test (org.jbpm) for testing only, do not include it in the actual application


== Manually configuring the {PROCESS_ENGINE} to use persistence


You can use the `JPAKnowledgeService` to create your KIE session.
This is slightly more complex, but gives you full access to the underlying configurations.
You can create a new KIE session using `JPAKnowledgeService` based on a KIE base, a KIE session configuration (if necessary) and an environment.
The environment  needs to contain a reference to your Entity Manager Factory.
For example:

[source,java]
----

// create the entity manager factory and register it in the environment
EntityManagerFactory emf =
    Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory( "org.jbpm.persistence.jpa" );
Environment env = KnowledgeBaseFactory.newEnvironment();
env.set( EnvironmentName.ENTITY_MANAGER_FACTORY, emf );

// create a new KIE session that uses JPA to store the runtime state
StatefulKnowledgeSession ksession = JPAKnowledgeService.newStatefulKnowledgeSession( kbase, null, env );
int sessionId = ksession.getId();

// invoke methods on your method here
ksession.startProcess( "MyProcess" );
ksession.dispose();
----


You can also use the `JPAKnowledgeService` to recreate a session based on a specific session id:

[source,java]
----

// recreate the session from database using the sessionId
ksession = JPAKnowledgeService.loadStatefulKnowledgeSession(sessionId, kbase, null, env );
----


Note that we only save the minimal state that is needed to continue execution of the process instance at some later point.
This means, for example, that it does not contain information about already executed nodes if that information is no longer relevant, or that process instances that have been completed or aborted are removed from the database.
If you want to search for history-related information, you should use the history log, as explained later.

You need to add a persistence configuration to your classpath to  configure JPA to use Hibernate and the H2 database (or your own preference), called [path]_persistence.xml_
 in the META-INF directory, as shown below.
For more details on how to change this for your own configuration, refer to the JPA and Hibernate documentation.

[source,xml]

This configuration file refers to a data source called "jdbc/jbpm-ds". If you run your application in an application server (such as JBoss AS), these containers typically allow you to easily set up data sources using some configuration (such as adding a data source configuration file in the deploy directory).  Please refer to your application server documentation to know how to do this.

For example, if you're deploying to Wildfly, you can  create a data source by dropping a configuration file in the deploy directory,  for example:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<datasources>
  <local-tx-datasource>
    <jndi-name>jdbc/jbpm-ds</jndi-name>
    <connection-url>jdbc:h2:tcp://localhost/~/test</connection-url>
    <driver-class>org.h2.jdbcx.JdbcDataSource</driver-class>
    <user-name>sa</user-name>
    <password></password>
  </local-tx-datasource>
</datasources>
----


If you are executing in a simple Java environment, you can use Narayana and Tomcat DBCP by using the `DataSourceFactory` class from the kie-test-util module of drools. See the following code fragment. This example uses the H2 in-memory database in combination with Narayana and Tomcat DBCP.

[source,java]
----
Properties driverProperties = new Properties();
driverProperties.put("user", "sa");
driverProperties.put("password", "sa");
driverProperties.put("url", "jdbc:h2:mem:jbpm-db;MVCC=true");
driverProperties.put("driverClassName", "org.h2.Driver");
driverProperties.put("className", "org.h2.jdbcx.JdbcDataSource");
PoolingDataSourceWrapper pdsw = DataSourceFactory.setupPoolingDataSource("jdbc/jbpm-ds", driverProperties);

== Configuring the {PROCESS_ENGINE} to use persistence


You need to configure the {PROCESS_ENGINE} to use persistence. The is most effectively done through `RuntimeEnvironmentBuilder`.

It is easy to use `RuntimeEnvironmentBuilder` to create a session to run or test {PROCESS_ENGINE} flows. By default `RuntimeEnvironmentBuilder` searches for the `jdbc/jbpm-ds`, so this simple code segment creates a `KieSession` with an empty context.

[source,java]
----
RuntimeEnvironmentBuilder builder = RuntimeEnvironmentBuilder.Factory.get()
        .newDefaultBuilder()
        .knowledgeBase(kbase);
RuntimeManager manager = RuntimeManagerFactory.Factory.get()
        .newSingletonRuntimeManager(builder.get(), "com.sample:example:1.0");
RuntimeEngine engine = manager.getRuntimeEngine(EmptyContext.get());
KieSession ksession = engine.getKieSession();
----

The above code will also need a `kbase` parameter. One simple method is to use a `kmodule.xml` kjar descriptor found on the classpath as shown in this example. 

[source,java]
----
KieServices ks = KieServices.Factory.get();
KieContainer kContainer = ks.getKieClasspathContainer();
KieBase kbase = kContainer.getKieBase("kbase");
----

A `kmodule.xml` descriptor can include an attribute for resource packages to scan to find and deploy {PROCESS_ENGINE} workflows.

[source,xml]
----
<kmodule xmlns="http://jboss.org/kie/6.0.0/kmodule">
  <kbase name="kbase" packages="com.sample"/>
</kmodule>
----

Control over the persistence can be accomplished through the `RuntimeEnvironmentBuilder::entityManagerFactory` method as shown below.


[source,java]
----
EntityManagerFactory emf = Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory("org.jbpm.persistence.jpa");                            

RuntimeEnvironment runtimeEnv = RuntimeEnvironmentBuilder.Factory
        .get()
        .newDefaultBuilder()
        .entityManagerFactory(emf)
        .knowledgeBase(kbase)
        .get();

StatefulKnowledgeSession ksession = (StatefulKnowledgeSession) RuntimeManagerFactory.Factory.get()
        .newSingletonRuntimeManager(runtimeEnv)
        .getRuntimeEngine(EmptyContext.get())
        .getKieSession();
----

Once you have done that, you can just call methods on this ksession (like ``startProcess``) and the {PROCESS_ENGINE} will persist all runtime state in the created data source.

You can re-create your session by using an identifier in the session ID (which you can retrieve using `ksession.getId()`) to restore the session state from the database:

[source,java]
----
// recreate the session from database using the sessionId
StatefulKnowledgeSession ksession = JPAKnowledgeService.loadStatefulKnowledgeSession(sessionId, kbase, null, env );
----
