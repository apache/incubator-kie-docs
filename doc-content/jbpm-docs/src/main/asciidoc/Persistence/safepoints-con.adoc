= Safe points for persistence

The {PROCESS_ENGINE} saves the state of a process instance to persistent storage at _safe points_ during the execution of the process.

When a process instance is started or resumes execution from a previous wait state, the {PROCESS_ENGINE} continues the execution until no more actions can be performed. If no more actions can be performed, it means that the process has completed or else has reached a wait state. If the process contains several parallel paths, all the paths must reach a wait state.

This point in the execution of the process is considered a safe point. At this point, the {PROCESS_ENGINE} stores the state of the process instance, and of any other process instances that were affected by the execution, to persistent storage.
