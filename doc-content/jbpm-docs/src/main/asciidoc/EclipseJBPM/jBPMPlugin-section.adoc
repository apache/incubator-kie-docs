= jBPM Eclipse Plugin

The jBPM Eclipse plugin provides developers (and very technical users) with an environment  to edit and test processes, and integrate it deeply with their applications.
It provides the following features (on top of the Eclipse IDE):

* Wizards for creation of
** a jBPM project
** a BPMN2 process
* jBPM Perspective (showing the most commonly used views in a predefined layout)


== Installation

The jBPM installer is capable of downloading and installing an Eclipse installation, including the Drools and jBPM Eclipse plugin (with a full jBPM runtime preconfigured) and the Eclipse BPMN2 Modeler. 

[TIP]
====
Using the jBPM installer is definitely the recommended starting point for most users.
====

You can however also download and install the jBPM Eclipse Plugin manually.
To do so, you need to:

* Download Eclipse (Kepler recommended, but older versions like Indigo or Juno should also still work)
* Start Eclipse
* Select "Install New Software ..." from the Help menu. Add the Drools and jBPM update site http://downloads.jboss.org/jbpm/release/6.0.1.Final/updatesite/[ http://downloads.jboss.org/jbpm/release/6.0.1.Final/updatesite/]. You should see the plugins as shown below. Note that you can also download and unzip the Drools and jBPM update site to your local file system and use that as local update site instead.

+
Select the JBoss jBPM Core and JBoss Drools Core plugins and click "Next >". Click "Next >" again after reviewing your selecting, accept the terms of the license  agreement and click "Finish" to download and install the plugins.
If you get a warning about installing software that contains unsigned content, click OK.
After successful installation, Eclipse should ask you to restart, click Yes.
* The plugin should now be installed. To check, check if you can for example see the new jBPM Project wizard: under the "File" menu, select "New Project ..." and there you should be  able to see "New jBPM Project" under the jBPM category.
* Register a jBPM runtime to get started, see the section on jBPM runtimes in this chapter for more information.


Note that, when doing a manual install, you still need to manually install the Eclipse BPMN 2.0 Modeler plugin as well.
Check out the chapter on the Eclipse BPMN 2.0 Modeler on how to do that.

== jBPM Project Wizard

The aim of the new project wizard is to set up an executable sample project to start using processes immediately.
This will set up a basic structure, the classpath, sample process and a test case to get you started.
To create a new jBPM project, in the "File" menu select "New" and then "Project ..." and under the jBPM category, select "jBPM Project".  A dialog as shown below should pop up.


image::EclipseJBPM/WizardProject.png[]


Fill in a name for your project and if necessary change the location where this project should be located (by default Eclipse will generate it inside your Eclipse workspace folder) and click "Next >".

Now you can optionally include a sample process in your project to get started.
You can select to either use a simple "Hello World" process, a slightly more advanced process including human tasks and persistence or simply an empty project.
You can also select to include a JUnit test class that you can use to test your process.
These can serve as a starting point, and will give you something executable almost immediately, which you can then modify to your needs. 


image::EclipseJBPM/WizardProject2.png[]


Finally, the last page in the wizard allows you select a jBPM runtime, as shown below.
You can either use the default runtime (as configured for you workspace, in your workspace preferences), or you can select a specific runtime for this project.
For more information about runtimes and how to create them, see the section on jBPM runtimes in this chapter.

You can also select which version of jBPM you want to generate sample code for.
By default it will generate an example using the latest jBPM 6.x API, but you could also generate examples using the old jBPM 5.x API.
Note that you yourself are responsible for making sure that the code you generate can be understood by the runtime (for example, if you create an example using jBPM6 API but select a jBPM5 runtime, your sample will not compile).  Also note that, if you want to execute a jBPM5 example on jBPM6, you will need to have the knowledge-api JAR inside your jBPM6 runtime, as this is responsible for the backwards compatibility of the jBPM5 API in jBPM6.

When you selected the simple 'hello world' example, the result is shown below.
Feel free to experiment with the plug-in at this point.

.New jBPM project artifacts
image::EclipseJBPM/WizardProjectStructure.png[]


The newly created project contains an example process file (sample.bpmn) in the src/main/resources directory and an example Java file (ProcessTest.java) that can be used to test the process in a {ENGINE}.
You'll find this in the folder src/main/java, in the com.sample package.
All the other JARs that are necessary during execution are also added to the classpath in a custom classpath container called jBPM Library.

You can also convert an existing Java project to a jBPM project by selecting the "Convert to jBPM Project" action.
Right-click the project you want to convert and under the "Configure" category (at the bottom) select "Convert to jBPM Project".  This will add the jBPM Library to your project's classpath.

== New BPMN2 Process Wizard

You can create a new process simply as an empty text file with extension ".bpmn", or use the "New BPMN2 Process" wizard to do so.
To create a new process, in the  "File" menu select "New" and then "Other ..." and under the jBPM category, select  "BPMN2 Process" and click "Next >".  In the next dialog, you should select the folder where the process should be created (for example the src/main/resources folder of your project) and a name for the process.
Clicking "Finish" should create your new process (by default it should only contain one start node) and open it so you can start editing it.

== jBPM Runtime

A jBPM runtime is a collection of JAR files that represent one specific release of the jBPM project JARs.
To create a runtime, download the binary distribution of the version of jBPM you want to use and unzip on your local file system.
You must then point the IDE to the  release of your choice by selecting the folder where these JARs are located.
If you want to  create a new runtime based on the latest jBPM project JARs included in the plugin itself, you can also easily do that.
You are required to specify a default jBPM runtime for your Eclipse workspace, but each individual project can override the default and select the appropriate runtime for that project specifically.

=== Defining a jBPM Runtime

To define one or more jBPM runtimes using the Eclipse preferences view you open up your Preferences, by selecting the "Preferences" menu item in the menu "Window". A "Preferences" dialog should show all your settings.
On the left side of this dialog, under the jBPM category, select "Installed jBPM runtimes". The panel on the right should then show the currently defined jBPM runtimes.
For example, if you used the jBPM Installer, it should look like the figure below.


image::EclipseJBPM/PreferencesRuntimes.png[]


To define a new jBPM runtime, click on the "Add" button.
A dialog such as the one shown below should pop up, asking for the name of your runtime and the location on your file system where it can be found.


image::EclipseJBPM/PreferencesAddRuntime.png[]


In general, you have two options:

. If you simply want to use the default JAR files as included in the jBPM Eclipse plugin, you can create a new jBPM runtime automatically by clicking the "Create a new jBPM Runtime ..." button. A file browser will show up, asking you to select the folder on your file system where you want this runtime to be created. The plugin will then automatically copy all required dependencies to the specified folder. Make sure to select a unique name for the newly created runtime and click "OK" to register this runtime.
+

[TIP]
====
Note that creating a jBPM runtime from the default JAR files as included in the jBPM Eclipse plugin is only recommended to get you started the first time and for very simple use cases.
The runtime that is created this way only contains the minimal set of JARs, and therefore doesn't support a significant set of features, including for example persistence.
Make sure to create a full runtime (using the second approach) for real  development.
====
. If you want to use one specific release of the jBPM project, you should create a folder on your file system that contains all the necessary jBPM libraries and dependencies (for example by downloading the binary distribution and unzipping it on your local file system). Instead of creating a new jBPM runtime as explained above, give your runtime a unique name and click the "Browse ..." button to select the location of this folder containing all the required JARs. Click "OK" to register this runtime.


After clicking the OK button, the runtime should show up in your table of installed jBPM runtimes, as shown below.
Click on the checkbox in front of one of the installed runtimes to make it the default jBPM runtime.
The default jBPM runtime will be used as the runtime of all your new jBPM projects (in case you didn't select a project-specific runtime).

You can add as many jBPM runtimes as you need.
Note that you will need to restart Eclipse if you changed the default runtime and you want to make sure that all the projects that are using the default runtime  update their classpath accordingly.

=== Selecting a runtime for your jBPM project

Whenever you create a jBPM project (using the New jBPM Project wizard or by converting an existing Java project to a jBPM project), the plugin will automatically add all the required JARs to the classpath of your project.

When creating a new jBPM project, the plugin will automatically use the default Drools runtime for that project, unless you specify a project-specific one.
You can do this in the final step of the New jBPM Project wizard, as shown below, by deselecting the "Use default Drools runtime" checkbox and selecting the appropriate runtime in the drop-down box.
If you click the "Configure workspace settings ..." link, the workspace preferences showing the currently installed jBPM runtimes will be opened, so you can add new runtimes there.


image::EclipseJBPM/WizardProject3.png[]


You can change the runtime of a jBPM project at any time by opening the project properties and selecting the jBPM category, as shown below.
Mark the "Enable project specific settings" checkbox and select the appropriate runtime from the drop-down box.
If you click the "Configure workspace settings ..." link, the workspace preferences showing the currently installed jBPM runtimes will be opened, so you can add new runtimes there.
If you deselect the "Enable project specific settings" checkbox, it will use the default runtime as defined in your global workspace preferences.


image::EclipseJBPM/PreferencesProject.png[]


== jBPM Maven Project Wizard

The aim of the new Maven project wizard is to set up an executable sample project to start using processes immediately (but not as normal Java project with all jBPM dependencies added using a jBPM library but by using Maven (and thus a pom.xml) to define your project's properties and dependencies.
This wizard will set up a Maven project using a pom.xml, and include a sample process and Java class to execute it.
To create a new jBPM Maven project, in the "File" menu select "New" and then "Project ..." and under the jBPM category, select "jBPM Project (Maven)".  Give your project a name and click finish.
The result should be as shown below.


image::EclipseJBPM/WizardMavenProject.png[]


The pom.xml that is generated for your project contains the following:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
         xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">

  <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>

  <groupId>com.sample</groupId>
  <artifactId>jbpm-example</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>

  <name>jBPM :: Sample Maven Project</name>
  <description>A sample jBPM Maven project</description>

  <properties>
    <version.org.jbpm>6.0.0.Final</version.org.jbpm>
  </properties>

  <repositories>

      <releases>
        <enabled>true</enabled>
        <updatePolicy>never</updatePolicy>
      </releases>
      <snapshots>
        <enabled>true</enabled>
        <updatePolicy>daily</updatePolicy>
      </snapshots>
    </repository>
  </repositories>

  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.jbpm</groupId>
      <artifactId>jbpm-test</artifactId>
      <version>${version.org.jbpm}</version>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
</project>
----

In the properties section, you can specify which version of jBPM you would like to use (by default it uses 6.0.0.Final).  It adds the JBoss Nexus Maven repository (where all the jBPM JARs and their dependencies are located) to your project and configures the dependencies.

[NOTE]
====
By default, only the jbpm-test JAR is specified as a dependency, as this has transitive dependencies to almost all of the core dependencies you will need.
You are free to update the dependencies section however to include only the dependencies you need.
====

The project also contains a sample process, under src/main/resources, in the com.sample package, and a kmodule.xml configuration file under the META-INF folder.
The kmodule.xml defines which resources (processes, rules, etc.) are to be loaded as part of your project.
In this case, it is defining a kbase called "kbase" that will load all the resources in the com.sample folder:

[source,xml]
----
<kmodule xmlns="http://www.drools.org/xsd/kmodule">
  <kbase name="kbase" packages="com.sample"/>
</kmodule>
----

Finally, it also contains a Java class that can be used to execute the sample process.
It will first create a kbase called "kbase" (by inspecting the kmodule.xml file and thus loading the `sample.bpmn` process) and then use a `RuntimeManager` to get access to a `KieSession` and ``TaskService``.
In this case, it is used to start a process and then complete the tasks created by this process one by one.

== Drools Eclipse plugin

The Drools Eclipse Plugin, which is bundled as part of the same Eclipse Update Site as the jBPM Eclipse Plugin, provides similar features for creating and editing business rules, and execute them using the {ENGINE}.
This for example allows you to create and edit .drl files containing business rules.
You can combine your processes and rules inside one project and execute them together on the same KieSession.
