= Runtime data service for CDI

The `RuntimeDataService` service provides access to data that is available at runtime, including the following data:

* The available processes to be executed, with various filters
* The active process instances, with various filters
* The process instance history 
* The process instance variables
* The active and completed nodes of process instance

The default implementation of `RuntimeDataService` observes deployment events and indexes all deployed processes to expose them to the calling components.
