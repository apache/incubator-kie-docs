The {PROCESS_ENGINE}
endif::PAM,DM[]
provides a complete integration layer for Enterprise Java Beans (EJB). This layer supports both local and remote EJB interaction. 

The following modules provide EJB services:

* `jbpm-services-ejb-api`: The API module that extends the `jbpm-services-api` module with EJB-specific interfaces and objects
* `jbpm-services-ejb-impl`: An EJB extension for core services
* `jbpm-services-ejb-timer`: A {PROCESS_ENGINE} Scheduler Service implementation based on the EJB Timer Service
* `jbpm-services-ejb-client`: An EJB remote client implementation for remote interaction, which supports {EAP} by default

The EJB layer is based on {PROCESS_ENGINE} services. It  provides almost the same capabilities as the core module, though  some limitations exist if you use the remote interface.

The main limitation affects the deployment service, which, if it is used as a remote EJB service, supports only the following methods:

* `deploy()`
* `undeploy()`
* `activate()`
* `deactivate()`
* `isDeployed()`

Other methods are excluded because they return instances of runtime objects, such as `RuntimeManager`, which can not be used over the remote interface.

All other services provide the same functionality over EJB as the versions included in the core module.
