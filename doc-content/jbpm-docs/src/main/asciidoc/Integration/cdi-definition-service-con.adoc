= Definition service for CDI

The `DefinitionService` service provides access to process details that are stored as part of BPMN2 XML definitions. 

[NOTE]
====
Before using any method that provides information, invoke the `buildProcessDefinition()` method to populate the repository with process information that is retrieved from the BPMN2 content.
====

The `BPMN2DataService` implementation provides access to the following data:

* The overall description of the process for the given process definition
* The collection of all user tasks found in the process definition
* The information about the defined inputs for a user task node
* The information about defined outputs for a user task node
* The IDs of reusable processes (call activity) that are defined within a given process definition
* The information about process variables that are defined within a given process definition 
* The information about all organizational entities (users and groups) that are included in the process definition. Depending on the particular process definition, the returned values for users and groups can contain the following information:
** The actual user or group name
** The process variable that is used to get the actual user or group name on runtime, for example, `#{manager}`
