[id='spring-runtime-manager-con_{context}']
= Direct use of the runtime manager API in Spring

The runtime manager manages the {PROCESS_ENGINE} and task service in sychronization. For more information about the runtime manager, see xref:runtime-manager-con_{context}[].

To set up the runtime manager in the Spring framework, use the following factory beans:

* `org.kie.spring.factorybeans.RuntimeEnvironmentFactoryBean`
* `org.kie.spring.factorybeans.RuntimeManagerFactoryBean`
* `org.kie.spring.factorybeans.TaskServiceFactoryBean`

These factory beans provide a standard way to configure the `spring.xml` file for your Spring application.
