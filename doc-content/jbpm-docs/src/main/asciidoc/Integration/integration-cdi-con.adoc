= Integration with CDI

The {PROCESS_ENGINE} supports integration with CDI automatically. You can use most of its API in the CDI framework without any modification.

The {PROCESS_ENGINE} also provides some dedicated modules that are designed specifically for CDI containers. The most important module is `jbpm-services-cdi`, which provides CDI wrappers for {PROCESS_ENGINE} services. You can use these wrappers to integrate the {PROCESS_ENGINE} in CDI applications. The module provides the following set of services:

* `DeploymentService`
* `ProcessService`
* `UserTaskService`
* `RuntimeDataService`
* `DefinitionService`

These services are available for injection in any other CDI bean.
