While there are several ways to use the {PROCESS_ENGINE} with the Spring framework, two approaches are most frequently used

* Direct use of the Runtime Manager API
* Use of {PROCESS_ENGINE} services

Both approaches are tested and valid. 

If your application needs to use only one runtime manager, use the direct Runtime Manager API, because it is the simplest way to use the {PROCESS_ENGINE} within a Spring application.

If your application needs to use multiple instances of the runtime manager, use {PROCESS_ENGINE} services, which encapsulate best practices by providing a dynamic runtime environment.
