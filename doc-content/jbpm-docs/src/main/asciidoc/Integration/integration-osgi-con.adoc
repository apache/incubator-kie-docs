= Integration with OSGi

All core {PROCESS_ENGINE} JAR files and core dependencies are OSGi-enabled. The following additional {PROCESS_ENGINE} JAR files are also OSGI-enabled:

* jbpm-flow
* jbpm-flow-builder
* jbpm-bpmn2

OSGi-enabled JAR files contain `MANIFEST.MF` files in the `META-INF` directory. These files contain data such as the required dependencies. You can add such JAR files to an OSGi environment.

For additional information about the OSGi infrastructure, see the https://www.osgi.org/resources/where-to-start/[OSGI documentation].

[NOTE]
====
Support for integration with the OSGi framework is deprecated. It does not receive any new enhancements or features and will be removed in a future release.
