[id='runtimemanagerfactorybean-ref_{context}']
= `RuntimeManagerFactoryBean` bean

The `RuntimeManagerFactoryBean` factory bean produces `RuntimeManager` instances of a given type, based on the provided `RuntimeEnvironment` instance.

The supported types correspond to runtime manager strategies:

* `SINGLETON`
* `PER_REQUEST`
* `PER_PROCESS_INSTANCE`

The default type, when no type is specified, is `SINGLETON`.

The identifier is a mandatory property, because every runtime manager must be uniquely identified. All instances created by this factory are cached, so they can be properly disposed using the destroy method (`close()`).
