= Maven artifacts as deployment units

The {PROCESS_ENGINE}
endif::PAM,DM[]
provides a mechanism to deploy processes from Apache Maven artifacts. These artifacts are in the JAR file format and are known as _KJAR files_, or informally _KJARs_. A KJAR file includes a descriptor that defines a KIE base and KIE session. It also contains the business assets, including process definitions, that the {PROCESS_ENGINE} can load into the KIE base.

The descriptor of a KJAR file is represented by an XML file named `kie-deployment-descriptor.xml`. The descriptor can be empty, in which case the default configuration applies. It can also provide custom configuration for the KIE base and KIE session.

With an empty `kie-deployment-descriptor.xml` descriptor, the following default configuration applies:

* A single default KIE base is created with the following characteristics:
** It contains all assets from all packages in the KJAR file
** Its event processing mode is set to `cloud`
** Its equality behaviour is set to `identity`
** Its declarative agenda is disabled
** For CDI applications, its scope is set to `ApplicationScope`
* A single default stateless KIE session is created with the following characteristics:
** It is bound to the single KIE base
** Its clock type is set to `real time`
** For CDI applications, its scope is set to `ApplicationScope`
* A single default stateful KIE session is created with the following characteristics:
** It is bound to the single KIE base
** Its clock type is set to `real time`
** For CDI applications, its scope is set to `ApplicationScope`

If you do not want to use the defaults, you can change all configuration settings using the `kie-deployment-descriptor.xml` file. You can find the complete specification of all elements for this file in the https://github.com/kiegroup/droolsjbpm-knowledge/blob/{COMMUNITY_VERSION_FINAL}/kie-internal/src/main/resources/deployment-descriptor.xsd[XSD schema].

The following sample shows a custom `kie-deployment-descriptor.xml` file that configures the runtime engine. This example configures the most common options and includes a single work item handler. You can also use the `kie-deployment-descriptor.xml` file to configure other options.

[NOTE]
====
If you use the `RuntimeManager` class, this class creates `KieSession` instances, not the `KieContainer` class. However, the `kie-deployment-descriptor.xml` model is always used as a base of the construction process. The `KieContainer` class always creates the `KieBase` instance.
====

You can reference KJAR artifacts, like any other Maven artifacts, using the GAV (group, artifact, version) value. When deploying units from KJAR files, the {PROCESS_ENGINE} uses the GAV value as the release ID in the KIE API. You can use the GAV value to deploy KJAR artifacts into a runtime environment, for example, a {KIE_SERVER}.
