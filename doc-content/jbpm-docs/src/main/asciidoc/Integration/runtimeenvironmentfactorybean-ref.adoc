= `RuntimeEnvironmentFactoryBean` bean

The `RuntimeEnvironmentFactoryBean` factory bean produces instances of `RuntimeEnvironment`. These instances are required for creating `RuntimeManager` instances.

The bean supports creating the following types of `RuntimeEnvironment` instances with different default configurations:

* `DEFAULT`: The default, or most common, configuration for the runtime manager
* `EMPTY`: A completely empty environment that you can configure manually
* `DEFAULT_IN_MEMORY`: The same configuration as DEFAULT, but without persistence of the runtime engine
* `DEFAULT_KJAR`: The same configuration as DEFAULT, but assets are loaded from KJAR artifacts, which are identified by the release ID or the GAV value
* `DEFAULT_KJAR_CL`: The configuration is built from the `kmodule.xml` descriptor in a KJAR artifact

Mandatory properties depends on the selected type, however, knowledge information must be present for all types. This requirement means that one of the following kinds of information must be provided:

* `knowledgeBase`
* `assets`
* `releaseId`
* `groupId, artifactId, version`

For the `DEFAULT`, `DEFAULT_KJAR`, and `DEFAULT_KJAR_CL` types, you must also configure persistence by providing the following parameters:

* Entity manager factory
* Transaction manager

The transaction manager must be the Spring transaction manager, because persistence and transaction support is configured based on this transaction manager.

Optionally, you can provide an `EntityManager` instance instead of creating a new instance from `EntityManagerFactory`, for example, you might use a shared entity manager from Spring.

All other properties are optional. They can override defaults that are determined by the selected type of the runtime environment.
