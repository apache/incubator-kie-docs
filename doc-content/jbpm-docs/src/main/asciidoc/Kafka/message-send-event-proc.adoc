= Creating an event that sends Kafka messages

When designing your business process in {CENTRAL}, you can create an event that sends Kafka messages. 

The event can have a data object as an input data item. The {PROCESS_ENGINE} sends the content of a data object as a message in the configured topic.

.Procedure

. Open the project that contains your business process in {CENTRAL}.
. Create a data object defining the data that the message must contain. For instructions about creating data objects, see 
ifdef::PAM,DM[]
{URL_DEVELOPING_PROCESS_SERVICES}#assembly-designing-business-processes[_{DESIGNING_BUSINESS_PROCESSES}_].
endif::PAM,DM[]
ifdef::JBPM,DROOLS,OP[]
xref:jBPMBPMN2[].
endif::JBPM,DROOLS,OP[]
. Select the business process and open the business process designer.
. Add an intermediate throw event or an end event of the type _message_ or _signal_.
. Open the properties of the event.
. In the *Message* or *Signal* field, select *New* and then enter the name of the message or signal. This name must be the same as the name of the topic to which the event is to send Kafka messages, or else must be defined in an `org.kie.server.jbpm-kafka.ext.topics._broker-topic-name_` system property of the {KIE_SERVER}.
+
For instructions about using `org.kie.server.jbpm-kafka.ext.topics.*` system properties to define topic names, see xref:kieserver-kafka-proc_{context}[].
+
. Add an input data item. Select the data object that you created as its type.
. Save the business process.

.Next steps

To enable {KAFKA_PRODUCT} integration when running the process, you must configure the {KIE_SERVER} according to instructions in xref:kieserver-kafka-proc_{context}[].
