= Adding a custom task that sends Kafka messages 

You can add a `KafkaPublishMessages` custom task to your process. This task sends Kafka messages. It does not use the {KIE_SERVER} Kafka capability, so you can use this task in processes that do not run on a {KIE_SERVER}. However, this task is more complicated to configure than other {KAFKA_PRODUCT} integration options.

.Procedure

. In the {CENTRAL} administrative settings menu, as the administrative user, select *Custom Tasks Administration*.
. Ensure that *KafkaPublishMessages* is set to *On*. 
. In {CENTRAL}, select *Menu* -> *Design* -> *Projects* and then click the space name and the project name.
. Select the *Settings* -> *Custom Tasks* tab.
. In the *KafkaPublishMessages* line, click *Install*.
. Enter the following information:
** *Bootstrap Servers*: The host and port of the Kafka broker, for example, `localhost:9092`. You can use a comma-separated list of multiple host:port pairs.
** *Client ID*: An identifier string to pass to the broker when making requests. {KAFKA_PRODUCT} uses this string for logging.
** *Key Serializer class*: The class that provides the key serializer. Enter the standard serializer class name: `org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer`.
** *Value Serializer class*: The class that provides the value serializer. Enter the standard serializer class name: `org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer`.
. Click the *Assets* tab.
. Select the business process and open the business process designer.
. Add the `KafkaPublishMessages` custom task, available under *Custom Tasks* in the BPMN modeler palette.
. In the properties of the custom task, open the data assignments.
. Assign the *Key*, *Topic*, and *Value* inputs to define the message.
