= Adding a custom task that sends Kafka messages

You can add a `KafkaPublishMessages` custom task to your process. This task sends Kafka messages. It does not use the {KIE_SERVER} Kafka capability, so you can use this task in processes that do not run on a {KIE_SERVER}. However, this task can be more complicated to configure than other {KAFKA_PRODUCT} integration options.

.Procedure

. In the {CENTRAL} administrative settings menu, as the administrative user, select *Custom Tasks Administration*.
. Ensure that *KafkaPublishMessages* is set to *On*.
. In {CENTRAL}, select *Menu* -> *Design* -> *Projects* and then click the space name and the project name.
. Select the *Settings* -> *Custom Tasks* tab.
. In the *KafkaPublishMessages* line, click *Install*.
. Enter the following information:
** *Bootstrap Servers*: The host and port of the Kafka broker, for example, `localhost:9092`. You can use a comma-separated list of multiple host:port pairs.
** *Client ID*: An identifier string to pass to the broker when making requests. {KAFKA_PRODUCT} uses this string for logging.
** *Key Serializer class*: The class that provides the key serializer. You can use the standard serializer class name: `org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer`. Alternatively you can use your own custom serializer class.
** *Value Serializer class*: The class that provides the value serializer. You can use the standard serializer class name: `org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer`. Alternatively you can use your own custom serializer class.
+
In any of these fields, you can enter an `env[_property_]` value. In this case, the {PROCESS_ENGINE} reads the setting from a system property at runtime. For example, you can set *Client ID* to `env[application.client.id]` and then, before running the process service, set the client ID value in the `application.client.id` system property.
+
. If you entered to use a custom serializer class, complete the following additional configuration:
.. Select the *Settings* -> *Deployments* -> *Work Item Handlers* tab.
.. In the `KafkaPublishMessages` line, modify the `Value` field to add the `classLoader` parameter. For example,  the initial value of this field can be the following string:
+
--
----
new org.jbpm.process.workitem.kafka.KafkaWorkItemHandler("127.0.0.1:9092", "jbpm", "com.myspace.test.MyCustomSerializer", "com.myspace.test.MyCustomSerializer")
----

In this example, change the value to the following string:

----
new org.jbpm.process.workitem.kafka.KafkaWorkItemHandler("127.0.0.1:9092", "jbpm", "com.myspace.test.MyCustomSerializer", "com.myspace.test.MyCustomSerializer", classLoader)
----
--
+
. Select the *Assets* tab.
. Select the business process and open the business process designer.
. Add the `KafkaPublishMessages` custom task, available under *Custom Tasks* in the BPMN modeler palette.
. In the properties of the custom task, open the data assignments.

. Assign the *Key*, *Topic*, and *Value* inputs to define the message.

.Next steps

If you entered a custom serializer class, you must provide this class to your business application. For instructions about providing custom classes to your business application, see xref:custom-class-provide-proc_{context}[].
