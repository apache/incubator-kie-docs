= Creating an event that receives Kafka messages

When designing your business process in {CENTRAL}, you can create an event that receives Kafka messages.

This event is triggered each time a message arrives in the configured topic. The message must contain data that matches a predefined data object. The {PROCESS_ENGINE} parses the message and provides it as an output of the event.

.Prerequisites

* You are logged in to {CENTRAL} and have permission to edit business processes.
* You created a business process.

.Procedure

. In {CENTRAL}, open the project that contains your business process.
. Create a data object defining the data that the message must contain. For instructions about creating data objects, see
ifdef::PAM,DM[]
{URL_DEVELOPING_PROCESS_SERVICES}#assembly-designing-business-processes[_{DESIGNING_BUSINESS_PROCESSES}_].
endif::PAM,DM[]
ifdef::JBPM,DROOLS,OP[]
xref:jBPMBPMN2[].
endif::JBPM,DROOLS,OP[]
. Select the business process and open the business process designer.
. Add a start event, an intermediate catch event, or a boundary event that is attached to a human task. The event must have the `message` type.
. Open the properties of the event.
. In the *Message* field, select *New* and then enter the name of the message. This name must be the same as the name of the topic from which the event is to receive Kafka messages, or else must be defined as `_topic-name_` in an `org.kie.server.jbpm-kafka.ext.topics._topic-name_` {KIE_SERVER} system property.
+
For instructions about using `org.kie.server.jbpm-kafka.ext.topics.*` system properties to define topic names, see xref:kieserver-kafka-proc_{context}[].
+
. Add an output data item and set the type of this data item to the data object that you created.
. Save the business process.

[NOTE]
====
If a Kafka message event starts a new process instance, the `initiator` field of the instance is set to `unknown` by default, because the Kafka consumer extension does not receive the identity of the user associated with the Kafka message.
====

.Next steps

To enable {KAFKA_PRODUCT} integration when running the process, you must configure {KIE_SERVER}. For more information about configuring {KIE_SERVER} for {KAFKA_PRODUCT} integration, see xref:kieserver-kafka-proc_{context}[].
