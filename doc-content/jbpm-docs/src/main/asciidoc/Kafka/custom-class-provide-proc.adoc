= Providing a custom class to your business application in {CENTRAL}

To interact with {KAFKA_PRODUCT}, your business application requires a custom class in the following cases:

* You want to use a custom message format for sending or receiving messages using message events.
* You want to use a custom serializer class for the `KafkaPublishMessages` custom task.

To use a custom class in your business application, use {CENTRAL} to upload the source code and configure the class.

Alternatively, if you deploy your application on SpringBoot, you can compile the classes separately and include them in the class path. In this case, do not complete this procedure.

.Procedure

. Prepare Java source files with the required custom classes, for example, `MyCustomSerializer`. Use the package name for your space and project, for example, `com.myspace.test`.
. In {CENTRAL}, enter your project and select the *Settings* -> *Dependencies* tab.
. Add any dependencies that your custom classes require, for example, `org.apache.kafka.kafka-clients`.
. Select the *Assets* tab.
. For each of the class source files, complete the following steps:
.. Click *Import Asset*.
.. In the *Please select a file to upload* field, select the location of the Java source file for the custom serializer class.
.. Click *Ok* to upload the file.
