= Intermediate events
Intermediate events drive the flow of a business process. Intermediate events are used to either catch or throw an event during the execution of the business process. These events are placed between the start and end events and can also be used on the boundary of an activity, like a sub-process or a human task, as a catch event. In the BPMN modeler, you can set a data output in the *Data Output and Assignments* field for a boundary event, which is used in a further process to access the process instance details. Note that the compensation events do not support the feature of setting a data output variable.

For example, you can set the following data output variables for a boundary event:

* `nodeInstance`: Carries the node instance details to use in a further process when the boundary event is triggered.
* `signal`: Carries the name of the signal.
* `event`: Carries the event details.
* `workItem`: Carries the work item details. This variable can be set for work item or user task.

The boundary catch events can be configured as interrupting or non-interrupting.  An interrupting boundary catch event cancels the bound activity whereas a non-interrupting event does not.

An intermediate event handles a particular situation that occurs during process execution. The situation is a trigger for an intermediate event. In a process, intermediate events with one outgoing flow can be placed on an activity boundary.

If the event occurs while the activity is being executed, the event triggers its execution to the outgoing flow. One activity may have multiple boundary intermediate events. Note that depending on the behavior you require from the activity with the boundary intermediate event, you can use either of the following intermediate event types:

* Interrupting: The activity execution is interrupted and the execution of the intermediate event is triggered.
* Non-interrupting: The intermediate event is triggered and the activity execution continues.

[[_message_intermediate_event]]
.Message

A message intermediate event is an intermediate event that enables you to manage a message object. Use one of the following events:

* A throwing message intermediate event produces a message object based on the defined properties.
* A catching message intermediate event listens for a message object with the defined properties.


[[_timer_intermediate_event]]
.Timer
A timer intermediate event enables you to delay workflow execution or to trigger the workflow execution periodically. It represents a timer that can trigger one or multiple times after a specified period of time. When the timer intermediate event is triggered, the timer condition, which is the defined time, is checked and the outgoing flow is taken.
When the timer intermediate event is placed in the process workflow, it has one incoming flow and one outgoing flow. Its execution starts when the incoming flow transfers to the event. When a timer intermediate event is placed on an activity boundary, the execution is triggered at the same time as the activity execution.

The timer is canceled if the timer element is canceled, for example by completing or aborting the enclosing process instance.


[[_conditional_intermediate_event]]
.Conditional


A conditional intermediate event is an intermediate event with a boolean condition as its trigger. The event triggers further workflow execution when the condition evaluates to `true` and its outgoing flow is taken.

The event must define the [property]``Expression`` property. When a conditional intermediate event is placed in the process workflow, it has one incoming flow, one outgoing flow, and its execution starts when the incoming flow transfers to the event. When a conditional intermediate event is placed on an activity boundary, the execution is triggered at the same time as the activity execution. Note that if the event is non-interrupting, the event triggers continuously while the condition is ``true``.

[[_signal_intermediate_event]]
.Signal


A signal intermediate event enables you to produce or consume a signal object. Use either of the following options:

* A throwing signal intermediate event produces a signal object based on the defined properties.
* A catching signal intermediate event listens for a signal object with the defined properties.

[[_error_intermediate_event]]
.Error

An error intermediate event is an intermediate event that can be used only on an activity boundary. It enables the process to react to an error end event in the respective activity.
The activity must not be atomic. When the activity finishes with an error end event that produces an error object with the respective `ErrorCode` property, the error intermediate event catches the error object and execution continues to its outgoing flow.



[[_compensation_intermediate_event]]
.Compensation


A compensation intermediate event is a boundary event attached to an activity in a transaction sub-process. It can finish with a compensation end event or a cancel end event. The compensation intermediate event must be associated with a flow, which is connected to the compensation activity.

The activity associated with the boundary compensation intermediate event is executed if the transaction sub-process finishes with the compensation end event. The execution continues with the respective flow.

[[_escalation_intermediate_event]]
.Escalation


An escalation intermediate event is an intermediate event that enables you to produce or consume an escalation object. Depending on the action the event element should perform, you need to use either of the following options:

* A throwing escalation intermediate event produces an escalation object based on the defined properties.
* A catching escalation intermediate event listens for an escalation object with the defined properties.

[[_link_intermediate_event]]
.Link

A link intermediate event is an intermediate event that makes the process diagram easier to understand without adding additional logic to the process. Link intermediate event is limited to a single process level, for example, link intermediate event cannot connect a parent process with a sub-process.

Use either of the following options:

* A throwing link intermediate event produces a link object based on the defined properties.
* A catching link intermediate event listens for a link object with the defined properties.
