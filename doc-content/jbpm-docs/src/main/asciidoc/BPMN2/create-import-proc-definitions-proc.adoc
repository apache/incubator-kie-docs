= Creating and importing process definitions
After you build and deploy your project containing your business processes you can view the process definitions by logging in to {PRODUCT} and clicking *Menu* -> *Manage* -> *Process Definitions*.

[[_creating_a_process]]
== Creating a process definition

.Prerequisites
* You are logged in to {PRODUCT} with the repository connected.

.Procedure
. Click *Menu* -> *Design* -> *Projects* and select the project where you want to create the process definition

 (in the *Project* view, select the respective repository and project in the drop-down lists; in the *Repository* view, navigate to `REPOSITORY/PROJECT/src/main/resources/` directory).
+

.Creating packages
[NOTE]
====
It is recommended to create your resources, including your process definitions, in a package of a project to allow importing of resources and their referencing. To create a package, do the following:

. In the *Repository* view of the Project Explorer, navigate to the `REPOSITORY/PROJECT/src/main/resources/` directory.
. Go to *New Item* -> *Package*.
. In the *New resource* dialog, define the package name and check the location of the package in the repository.

====
+
. From the perspective menu, go to *New Item* -> *Business Process*.
. In the *New Processes* dialog box, enter the Process name and click *OK*. Wait until the Process Editor with the Process diagram appears.
+


[[_importing_a_process_definition]]
== Importing a process definition
. In the *Project Explorer*, select a project and the respective package to which you want to import the Process definition.
. Create a new Business Process to work in by going to *New Item* -> *Business Process*.
. In the Process Designer toolbar, click the *Import* image:processes/5209.png[] icon in the editor toolbar and pick the format of the imported process definition. Note that you have to choose to overwrite the existing process definition in order to import.
. From the *Import* window, locate the Process file and click *Import*.

Whenever a process definition is imported, the existing imported definition is overwritten.
Make sure you are not overwriting a process definition you have edited so as not to lose any changes.

A process can also be imported to the git repository in the filesystem by cloning the repository, adding the process files, and pushing the changes back to git.
In addition to alternative import methods, you can copy and paste a process or just open a file in the import dialog.

When importing processes, the Process Designer provides visual support for Process elements and therefore requires information on element positions on the canvas.
If the information is not provided in the imported Process, you need to add it manually.
