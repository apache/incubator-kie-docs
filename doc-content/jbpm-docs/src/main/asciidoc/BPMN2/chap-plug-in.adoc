Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite comes with a plug-in for Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio to provide support for the development of business processes in the Eclipse-based environment, such as debugging and testing. It also provides a graphical Process Designer for business process editing.

Note that the repository structure follows the maven structure and is described in <<_chap_project>>.

For instructions on how to install and set up the plug-in, see the _Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite Installation Guide_.

= Creating BPM Project

.Prerequisite
Ensure that you have installed Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite and Red Hat JBoss BRMS plug-ins and runtime environments. For more information, see _Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite Installation Guide_.

To create a BPM project:

. On the main menu of Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio, click *File* -> *New* -> *Other...*.
. Choose *jBPM* -> *jBPM project*.
. In the *Create New jBPM Project* dialog, select the required content and click *Next*.
. If you did not decide for project with online examples, specify the project name, location, and type:
* `Java and jBPM Runtime classes`: select the runtime to be used by the project or click *Manage Runtime Definitions...* and define a new runtime (for details on runtime resources, see the _Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite Installation Guide_).
* `Maven`: specify maven properties of your project.

[[_creating_process]]
= Creating Process

In JBoss Developer Studio with the Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite plug-in, a process is created the same way as other resources:

. Choose *File* -> *New* -> *Other...*.
. Select *jBPM* -> *jBPM Process Diagram*.
. In the displayed dialog box, define the name, package, and container of the process. The rest of the fields is completed automatically. Note that you must follow the Maven structure.

Once created, the process is opened for editing in the graphical Process Designer.

[[_checking_session_logs]]
= Checking Session Logs

You can check the session logs in the audit log, which is a log of all events that were logged from the session. Audit log is an XML-based log file which contains a log of all the events that occurred while executing a specific ksession.

.Procedure: Creating Logger
. To create a logger, use `KieServices` and attach the logger to a `ksession`, for example:
+
[source,java]
----
KieRuntimeLogger logger = KieServices.Factory.get().getLoggers().newThreadedFileLogger(ksession, "mylogfile", 1000);
// Do something with the ksession here.
logger.close();
----
. Do not forget to close the logger when you finish using it.

.Procedure: Using Audit View
. To use *Audit View*, open *Window* -> *Show View* -> *Other...*.
. Under the *Drools* category, select *Audit*.
. To open a log file in *Audit View*, select the log file using the *Open Log* action in the top right corner, or simply drag and drop the log file from the _Package Explorer_ or _Navigator_ into the _Audit View_.
. A tree-based view is generated based on the data inside the audit log. Depicted below is an example tree-based view:
+
.Tree-Based View

. An event is shown as a subnode of another event if the child event is caused by a direct consequence of the parent event.

[NOTE]
.File-Based Logger
====
The file-based logger will only save the events on close (or when a certain threshhold is reached). If you want to make sure the events are saved on a regular interval (for example during debugging), make sure to use a threaded file logger, so the audit view can be updated to show the latest state. When creating a threaded file logger, you can specify the interval after which events should be saved to the file (in milliseconds).
