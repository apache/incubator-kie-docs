= BPMN2 swimlanes in process designer

Swimlanes are process elements that visually group tasks related to one group or user. You can use user tasks in combination with swimlanes to assign multiple user tasks to the same actor, due to `Autoclaim` property of the swimlanes. When a potential owner of a group claims the first task in a swimlane, then other tasks are directly assigned to the same owner. Therefore, the claim for other tasks is not needed by the remaining owners of the group. The `Autoclaim` property enables the auto-assignment of the tasks that are related to a swimlane.

NOTE: If the remaining user tasks in a swimlane contain multiple predefined `ActorIds`, then the user tasks are not assigned automatically.

In the following example, an analyst lane consists of two user tasks:

The *Group* field in the _Update Customer Details_ and _Resolve Customer Issue_ tasks contain the value `analyst`. When the process is started, and the _Update Customer Details_ task is claimed, started, or completed by an analyst, and the _Resolve Customer Issue_ task is claimed and assigned to the user who completed the first task. However, if only the _Update Customer Details_ task contains the analyst group assigned, and the second task contains no user or group assignments, and the process stops after the first task completes.

You can disable the `Autoclaim` property of the swimlanes. If the `Autoclaim` property is disabled, then the tasks related to a swimlane are not assigned automatically. By default, the value of `Autoclaim` property is set as `true`. If needed, you can also change the default value for the `Autoclaim` property from project settings in {CENTRAL} or using the deployment descriptor file.

To change the default value of `Autoclaim` property of swimlanes in {CENTRAL}:

. Go to project *Settings*.
. Open *Deployment -> Environment entries*.
. Enter the following values in the given fields:
+
* *Name* - `Autoclaim`
* *Value* - `"false‚Äù`

If you want to set the environment entry in the XML deployment descriptor, add the following code to the `kie-deployment-descriptor.xml` file:

[source,xml]
----
<environment-entries>
  ..
    <environment-entry>
        <resolver>mvel</resolver>
        <identifier>new String ("false")</identifier>
        <parameters/>
        <name>Autoclaim</name>
    </environment-entry>
  ..
</environment-entries>
