= Setting the user task assignment strategy

The user task assignment strategy is used to automatically assign the tasks to a suitable user. The assignment strategy allows more efficient task allocation based on the associated properties, such as potential owners, task priority, and task data. `org.jbpm.task.assignment.strategy` is the system property for the user task assignment strategy in {PRODUCT}. You can also explicitly define an assignment strategy for a user task in {CENTRAL}.

.Prerequisites
