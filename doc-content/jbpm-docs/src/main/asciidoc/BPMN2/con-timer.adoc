= Timers

You can use timers to trigger logic after a certain period or to repeat specific actions at regular intervals. Timers wait for a predefined amount of time before triggering once or repeatedly.

== Configuration of timers with delay and period

You can set a timer with delay and a certain period. The delay specifies the waiting time after the node activation, and the period defines the time between the subsequent trigger activation. The period value `0` results in a one-shot timer. You can specify the delay and period expression in `[\#d][#h][#m][#s][#[ms]]` form, indicating the number of days, hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds (default). For example, the expression `1h` indicates one hour waiting time before triggering the timer again.

== Configuration of timers with ISO-8601 date format

You can configure timers with ISO-8601 date format that supports both one-shot timers and repeatable timers. You can define timers as date and time representation, time duration, or repeating intervals. For example:

* Date `2020-12-24T20:00:00.000+02:00` signifies that timer is triggered exactly on Christmas at 8:00 p.m.
* Duration `PT1S` signifies that timer is triggered once after one second.
* Repeating intervals `R/PT1S` signifies that timer is triggered every second with any limit. Alternatively, `R5/PT1S` triggers the timer five times every second.

== Configuration of timers with process variables

You can also specify timers using process variables, consisting of the string representation of delay and period or ISO8601 date format. When you specify `#{variable}`, the engine parses the expression and replaces the expression value with the variable. In a process, you can use timers using the following ways:

* Add a timer event to a process flow. The process activation starts the timer and when the timer is triggered (once or repeatedly), it activates the successor of the timer node. Subsequently, the outgoing connection of a timer with a positive period value is triggered multiple times. When a timer node is canceled, the associated timer is also canceled and no more triggers occur.

* Associate timer as a boundary event with a subprocess or task.

== Update timers within running process instance

In some cases, the scheduled timer needs to be rescheduled to accommodate the new requirements, such as changing delay, period, or repeat limit. Updating a timer includes many low-level operations, therefore, {PRODUCT} provides the following command to perform the low-level operations related to updating a timer as an atomic operation. The following command ensures that all the operations are performed within the same transaction.

`org.jbpm.process.instance.command.UpdateTimerCommand`

NOTE: Only boundary timer events and intermediate timer events are supported to update.

You can reschedule the timer by specifying the two mandatory parameters and one of the three optional parameter sets of the `UpdateTimerCommand` class.

// Start the process instance and record its ID:

// Set the timer delay to 3 seconds:
kieSession.execute(new UpdateTimerCommand(id, BOUNDARY_TIMER_ATTACHED_TO_NAME, 3));
