== Script task

.Script task
image::BPMN2/ScriptTask.png[]

Represents a script that should be executed in this process.
A Script Task should have one incoming connection and one outgoing connection.
The associated action specifies what should be executed, the dialect used for coding the action (i.e., Java, JavaScript or MVEL), and the actual action code.
This code can access any variables and globals.
There is also a predefined variable `kcontext` that references the https://docs.jboss.org/jbpm/v6.0.1/javadocs/org/kie/api/runtime/process/ProcessContext.html[ProcessContext] object (which can, for example, be used to access the current `ProcessInstance` or ``NodeInstance``, and to get and set variables, or get access to the ksession using ``kcontext.getKieRuntime()``). When a Script Task is reached in the process, it will execute the action and then continue with the next node.
It contains the following properties:

* __Id__: The id of the node (which is unique within one node container).
* __Name__: The display name of the node.
* __Action__: The action script associated with this  action node.

Note that you can write any valid Java code inside a script node.
This basically allows you to do anything inside such a script node.
There are some caveats however: 

* When trying to create a higher-level business process, that should
  also be understood by business users, it is probably wise to avoid low-level
  implementation details inside the process, including inside these script tasks.
  A Script Task could still be used to quickly manipulate variables etc. but
  other concepts like a Service Task could be used to model more complex
  behaviour in a higher-level manner.
* Scripts should be immediate.  They are using the engine thread
  to execute the script.  Scripts that could take some time to execute should
  probably be modeled as an asynchronous Service Task.
* You should try to avoid contacting external services through a
  script node.  Not only does this usually violate the first two caveats, it
  is also interacting with external services without the knowledge of the engine,
  which can be problematic, especially when using persistence and transactions.
  In general, it is probably wiser to model communication with an external
  service using a service task.
* Scripts should not throw exceptions.  Runtime exceptions should
  be caught and for example managed inside the script or transformed into
  signals or errors that can then be handled inside the process. 

== Service task

.Service task
image::BPMN2/ServiceTask.png[]

Represents an (abstract) unit of work that should be executed in this process.
All work that is executed outside the process engine should be represented (in a declarative way) using a Service Task.
Different types of services are predefined, e.g., sending an email, logging a message, etc.
Users can define domain-specific services or work items, using a unique name and by defining the parameters (input) and results (output) that are associated with this type of work.
Check the chapter on domain-specific processes for a detailed explanation and illustrative examples of how to define and use work items in your processes.
When a Service Task is reached in the process, the associated work is executed.
A Service Task should have one incoming connection and one outgoing connection.

* __Id__: The id of the node (which is unique within one node container).
* __Name__: The display name of the node.
* __Parameter mapping__: Allows copying the value of process variables to parameters of the work item.
  Upon creation of the work item, the values will be copied.
* __Result mapping__: Allows copying the value of result parameters of the work item to a process variable.
  Each type of work can define result parameters that will (potentially) be returned after the work item has been completed.
  A result mapping can be used to copy the value of the given result parameter to the given variable in this process.
  For example, the "FileFinder" work item returns a list of files that match the given search criteria within the result parameter ``Files``.
  This list of files can then be bound to a process variable for use within the process.
  Upon completion of the work item, the values will be copied.
* __On-entry and on-exit actions__: Actions that are executed upon entry or exit of this node, respectively.
* __Additional parameters__: Each type of work item can define additional parameters that are relevant for that type of work.
  For example, the "Email" work item defines additional parameters such as ``From``, ``To``, `Subject`            and ``Body``.
  The user can either provide values for these parameters directly, or define a parameter mapping that will copy the value of the given variable in this process to the given parameter; if both are specified, the mapping will have precedence.
  Parameters of type `String` can use ``__\#{expression}__`` to embed a value in the string.
  The value will be retrieved when creating the work item, and the substitution expression will be replaced by the result of calling `toString()` on the variable.
  The expression could simply be the name of a variable (in which case it resolves to the value of the variable), but more advanced MVEL expressions are possible as well, e.g., ``\#{person.name.firstname}``.

== User task

.User task
image::BPMN2/UserTask.png[]

Processes can also involve tasks that need to be executed by human actors.
A User Task represents an atomic task to be executed by a human actor.
It should have one incoming connection and one outgoing connection.
User Tasks can be used in combination with Swimlanes to assign multiple human tasks to similar actors.
Refer to the chapter on human tasks for more details.
A User Task is actually nothing more than a specific type of service node (of type "Human Task").  A User Task contains the following properties:

* __Id__: The id of the node (which is unique within one node container).
* __Name__: The display name of the node.
* __TaskName__: The name of the human task.
* __Priority__: An integer indicating the priority of the human task.
* __Comment__: A comment associated with the human task.
* __ActorId__: The actor id that is responsible for executing the human task.
  A list of actor id's can be specified using a comma (',') as separator.
* __GroupId__: The group id that is responsible for executing the human task.
  A list of group id's can be specified using a comma (',') as separator.
* __Skippable__: Specifies whether the human task can be skipped, i.e., whether the actor may decide not to execute the task.
* __Content__: The data associated with this task.
* __Swimlane__: The swimlane this human task node is part of.
  Swimlanes make it easy to assign multiple human tasks to the same actor.
  See the human tasks chapter for more detail on how to use swimlanes.
* __On entry and on exit actions__: Action scripts that are executed upon entry and exit of this node, respectively.
* __Parameter mapping__: Allows copying the value of process variables to parameters of the human task.
  Upon creation of the human tasks, the values will be copied.
* __Result mapping__: Allows copying the value  of result parameters of the human task to a process variable.
  Upon completion of the human task, the values will be copied.
  A human task has a result variable "Result" that contains the data returned by the human actor.
  The variable "ActorId" contains the id of the actor that actually executed the task.

A user task should define the type of task that needs to be executed (using properties like TaskName, Comment, etc.) and who needs to perform it (using either actorId or groupId).  Note that if there is data related to this specific process instance that the end user needs when performing the task, this data should be passed as the content of the task.
The task for example does not have access to process variables.
Check out the chapter on human tasks to get more detail on how to pass data between human tasks and the process instance.

== Reusable sub-process

.Reusable sub-process - Call activity
image::BPMN2/ReusableSubProcess.png[]

Represents the invocation of another process from within this process.
A sub-process node should have one incoming connection and one outgoing connection.
When a Reusable Sub-Process node is reached in the process, the engine will start the process with the given id.
It contains the following properties:

* __Id__: The id of the node (which is unique within one node container).
* __Name__: The display name of the node.
* __ProcessId__: The id of the process that should be executed.
* _Wait for completion_ (by default true): If this property is true, this sub-process node will only continue if the child process that was started has terminated its execution (completed or aborted); otherwise it will  continue immediately after starting the subprocess (so it will not wait for its completion).
* _Independent_ (by default true): If this property is true, the child process is started as an independent process, which means that the child process will not be terminated if this parent process is completed (or this sub-process node is canceled for some other reason); otherwise the active sub-process will be canceled on termination of the parent process (or cancellation of the sub-process node).  Note that you can only set independent to "false" only when "Wait for completion" is set to true. 
* __On-entry and on-exit actions__: Actions that are  executed upon entry or exit of this node, respectively.
* __Parameter in/out mapping__: A sub-process node can also define in- and out-mappings for variables.
  The variables given in the "in" mapping will be used as parameters (with the associated  parameter name) when starting the process.
  The variables of the child process that are defined for the "out" mappings will be copied to the variables of this process when the child process has been completed.
  Note that you can use "out" mappings only when "Wait for completion" is set to true.

== Business rule task

.Business rule task
image::BPMN2/BusinessRuleTask.png[]

A Business Rule Task Represents a set of rules that need to be  evaluated.
The rules are evaluated when the node is reached.
A Rule  Task should have one incoming connection and one outgoing connection.
Rules are defined in separate files using the Drools rule format.
Rules  can become part of a specific ruleflow group using the `ruleflow-group`  attribute in the header of the rule.

When a Rule Task is reached in the process, the engine will start  executing rules that are part of the corresponding ruleflow-group (if any).   Execution will automatically continue to the next node if there are  no more active rules in this ruleflow group.
As a result, during the  execution of a ruleflow group, new activations belonging to the currently active ruleflow group can be added to the Agenda due to changes made to the facts by the other rules.
Note that the process will immediately continue with the next node if it encounters a ruleflow group where there are no active rules at that time.

If the ruleflow group was already active, the ruleflow group will remain active and execution will only continue if all active rules of the ruleflow group has been completed.
It contains the following properties:

* __Id__: The id of the node (which is unique within one node container).
* __Name__: The display name of the node.
* __RuleFlowGroup__: The name of the ruleflow group that represents the set of rules of this RuleFlowGroup node.

== Embedded sub-process

.Embedded sub-process
image::BPMN2/EmbeddedSubProcess.png[]

A Sub-Process is  a node that can contain other nodes so that it acts as a node container.
This allows not only the embedding of a part of the process within such a sub-process node, but also the definition of additional variables that are accessible for all nodes inside this container.
A sub-process should have one incoming connection and one outgoing connection.
It should also contain one start node that defines where to start (inside the Sub-Process) when you reach the sub-process.
It should also contain one or more end events.
Note that, if you use a terminating event node inside a sub-process, you are terminating just that sub-process.
A sub-process ends when there are no more active nodes inside the sub-process.
It contains the following properties:

* __Id__: The id of the node (which is unique within one node container).
* __Name__: The display name of the node.
* __Variables__: Additional variables can be defined to store data during the execution of this node.
  See section "`<<_sec.data>>`" for details.

== Multi-instance sub-process

.Multi-instance sub-process
image::BPMN2/MultipleInstances.png[]

A Multiple Instance sub-process is a special kind of sub-process that allows you to execute the contained process segment multiple times, once for each element in a collection.
A  multiple instance sub-process should have one incoming connection and one outgoing connection.
It waits until the embedded process fragment is completed for each of the elements in the given collection before continuing.
It contains the following properties:

* __Id__: The id of the node (which is unique within one node container).
* __Name__: The display name of the node.
* __CollectionExpression__: The name of a variable that represents the collection of elements that should be iterated over.
  The collection variable should be an array or of type ``java.util.Collection``.
  If the collection expression evaluates to null or an empty collection, the multiple instances sub-process will be completed immediately and follow its outgoing connection.
* __VariableName__: The name of the variable to contain the current element from the collection.
  This gives nodes within the composite node access to the selected element.
* __CollectionOutput__: The name of a variable that represents collection of elements that will gather all output of the multi instance sub process
* __OutputVariableName__: The name of the variable to contain the currentl output from the multi instance activitiy
* __CompletionCondition__: MVEL expression that will be evaluated on each instance completion to check if given multi instance activity can already be completed.
  In case it evaluates to true all other remaining instances within multi instance activity will be canceled.
