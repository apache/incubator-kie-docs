= BPMN2 custom tasks in process designer

The BPMN2 specification supports the ability to extend the `bpmn2:task` element to create custom tasks in a software implementation. Similar to standard BPMN tasks, custom tasks identify actions to be completed in a business process model, but they also include specialized functionality, such as compatibility with an external service of a specific type (REST, email, or web service) or checkpoint behavior within a process (milestone).

{PRODUCT} provides the following predefined custom tasks under *Custom Tasks* in the BPMN modeler palette:

.Rest
A rest custom task is used to invoke a remote RESTful service or perform an HTTP request from a process.

image::BPMN2/bpmn-rest-custom-task.png[]

To use the rest custom task, you can set the URL, HTTP method, and credentials in the process modeler. When a process reaches a rest custom task, it generates an HTTP request and returns the response as a string.

You can click *Assignments* in the *Properties* panel to open the *REST Data I/O* window. In the *REST Data I/O* window, you can configure the data input and output as required. For example, to execute a rest custom task, enter the following data inputs in *Data Inputs and Assignments* fields:

* *Url*: Endpoint URL for the REST service. This attribute is mandatory.
* *Method*: Method of the endpoint called, such as `GET`, and `POST`. The default value is `GET`.
* *ContentType*: Data type when sending data. This attribute is mandatory for `POST` and `PUT` requests.
* *ContentTypeCharset*: Character set for the `ContentType`.
* *Content*: Data you want to send. This attribute supports backward compatibility, use the *ContentData* attribute instead.
* *ContentData*: Data you want to send. This attribute is mandatory for `POST` and `PUT` requests.
* *ConnectTimeout*: Connection timeout (in seconds). The default value is 60 seconds.
* *ReadTimeout*: Timeout (in seconds) on response. The default value is 60 seconds.
* *Username*: User name for authentication.
* *Password*: Password for authentication.
* *AuthUrl*: URL that is handling authentication.
* *AuthType*: Type of URL that is handling authentication.
* *HandleResponseErrors* (Optional): Instructs handler to throw errors in case of an unsuccessful response codes (except 2XX).
* *ResultClass*: Valid name of the class to which the response is unmarshalled. If not provided, then the raw response is returned in a string format.
* *AcceptHeader*: Value of the accept header.
* *AcceptCharset*: Character set of the accept header.
* *Headers*: Headers to pass for REST call, such as `content-type=text/html`.

You can add the following data output in *Data Outputs and Assignments* to store the output of the task execution:

* *Result*: Output variable (object type) of the rest custom task.

.Email
An email custom task is used to send an email from a process. It contains email body associated with it.

image::BPMN2/bpmn-email-custom-task.png[]

When an email custom task is activated, the email data is assigned to the data input property of the task. An email custom task completes when the associated email is sent.

You can click *Assignments* in the *Properties* panel to open the *Email Data I/O* window. In the *Email Data I/O* window, you can configure the data input as required. For example, to execute an email custom task, enter the following data inputs in *Data Inputs and Assignments* fields:

* *Body*: Body of the email.
* *From*: Email address of the sender.
* *Subject*: Subject of the email.
* *To*: Email address of the recipient. You can specify multiple email addresses separated by semicolon (;).
* *Template* (Optional): Template to generate body of the email. The `Template` attribute overrides the `Body` parameter, if entered.
* *Reply-To*: Email address to which reply message is sent.
* *Cc*: Email address of the copied recipient. You can specify multiple email addresses separated by semicolon (;).
* *Bcc*:  Email address of the blind copied recipient. You can specify multiple email addresses separated by semicolon (;).
* *Attachments*: Email attachment to send along with the email.
* *Debug*: Flag to enable the debug logging.

.Log
A log custom task is used to log a message from a process. When a business process reaches a log custom task, the message data is assigned to the data input property.

image::BPMN2/bpmn-log-custom-task.png[]

A log custom task completes when the associated message is logged. You can click *Assignments* in the *Properties* panel to open the *Log Data I/O* window. In the *Log Data I/O* window, you can configure the data input as required. For example, to execute a log custom task, enter the following data inputs in *Data Inputs and Assignments* fields:

* *Message*: Log message from the process.

.WebService
A web service custom task is used to invoke a web service from a process. This custom task serves as a web service client with the web service response stored as a string.

image::BPMN2/bpmn-webservice-custom-task.png[]

To invoke a web service from a process, you must use the correct task type. You can click *Assignments* in the *Properties* panel to open the *WS Data I/O* window. In the *WS Data I/O* window, you can configure the data input and output as required. For example, to execute a web service task, enter the following data inputs in *Data Inputs and Assignments* fields:

* *Endpoint*: Endpoint location of the web service to invoke.
* *Interface*: Name of a service, such as `Weather`.

You can add the following data output in *Data Outputs and Assignments* to store the output of the task execution:

* *Result*: Output variable (object type) of the web service task.

.Milestone
A milestone represents a single point of achievement within a process instance. You can use milestones to flag certain events to trigger other tasks or track the progress of the process.

image::BPMN2/bpmn-milestone.png[]

Milestones are useful for Key Performance Indicator (KPI) tracking or for identifying the tasks that are still to be completed. Milestones can occur at the end of a stage in a process or they can be the result of achieving other milestones.

Milestones can reach the following states during process execution:

* `Active`: A milestone condition has been defined for the milestone node but it has not been met.
* `Completed`: A milestone condition has been met (if applicable), the milestone has been achieved, and the process can proceed to the next task or can end.

You can click *Assignments* in the *Properties* panel to open the *Milestone Data I/O* window. In the *Milestone Data I/O* window, you can configure the data input as required. For example, to execute a milestone, enter the following data inputs in *Data Inputs and Assignments* fields:

* *Condition*: Condition for the milestone to meet. For example, you can enter a Java expression (string data type) that uses a process variable.

.DecisionTask
A decision task is used to execute a DMN diagram and invoke a decision engine service from a process. By default, a decision task maps to the DMN decision.
