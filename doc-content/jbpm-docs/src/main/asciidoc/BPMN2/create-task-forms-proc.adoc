//Use the image:processes/4975.png[] button to place the field types onto the canvas, where you can modify them. To modify the field types, use the icons that display when you place the cursor over a field: *First*, *Move field*, *Last*, *Group with previous*, *Edit*, or *Clear*.
//The icons enable you to change the order of the fields in the form, group the fields, or clear and edit their content.
