= Manually creating forms in {CENTRAL}
You can create task and process forms manually from your project asset view. This is another way to generate a form without selecting to generate forms from your business process. For example, the Form Modeler now supports creating forms from external data objects.

.Procedure
. In {CENTRAL}, go to *Menu* -> *Design* -> *Projects* and click the project name.
. Click *Add Asset* -> *Form*.
. Provide the following information in the *Create new Form* window:
* Form name (must be unique)
* Package name
* Model type: Select either *Business Process* or *Data Object*.
** For the *Business Process* model type, select your business process from the *Select Process* drop-down menu, and then select the form that you want to create from the *Select Form* drop-down menu.
** For the *Data Object* model type, select one of your project data objects from the *Select Data Object from Project* drop-down menu.
. Click *Ok* to open the Form Modeler.
. In the *Components* view on the left side of the Form Modeler, expand the *Model Fields* and *Form Controls* menus and create a new form by dragging your required fields and form controls to the canvas.
. Click *Save* to save your changes.

//Use the image:processes/4975.png[] button to place the field types onto the canvas, where you can modify them. To modify the field types, use the icons that display when you place the cursor over a field: *First*, *Move field*, *Last*, *Group with previous*, *Edit*, or *Clear*.
//The icons enable you to change the order of the fields in the form, group the fields, or clear and edit their content.
