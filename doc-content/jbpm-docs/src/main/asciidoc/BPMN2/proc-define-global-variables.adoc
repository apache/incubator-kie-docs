= Defining global variables

Global variables exist in a knowledge session and can be accessed and are shared by all assets in that session. They belong to the particular session of the Knowledge Base and they are used to pass information to the engine. Every global variable defines its ID and item subject reference. The ID serves as the variable name and must be unique within the process definition. The item subject reference defines the data type the variable stores.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The rules are evaluated at the moment the fact is inserted.
Therefore, if you are using a global variable to constrain a fact pattern and the global is not set, the system returns a ``NullPointerException``.
====

Global variables are initialized either when the process with the variable definition is added to the session or when the session is initialized with globals as its parameters.

Values of global variables can typically be changed during the assignment, which is a mapping between a process variable and an activity variable. The global variable is then associated with the local activity context, local activity variable, or by a direct call to the variable from a child context.

.Prerequisites
* You have created a project in {CENTRAL} and it contains at least one business process asset.

.Procedure
. Open a business process asset.
. Click a blank area of the process designer canvas.
. Click the *Properties* icon on the upper-right side of the screen to open the *Properties* panel.
. If necessary, expand the *Process* section.
. In the *Global Variables* sub-section, click the plus icon.
. Enter a name for the variable in the *Name* box.
. Select a data type from the *Data Type* menu.
