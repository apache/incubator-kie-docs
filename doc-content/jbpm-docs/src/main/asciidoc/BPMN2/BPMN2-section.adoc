= What is BPMN 2.0

[NOTE]
====
"The primary goal of BPMN is to provide a notation that is readily understandable by all business users, from the business analysts that create the initial drafts of the processes, to the technical developers responsible for implementing the technology that will perform those processes, and finally, to the business people who will manage and monitor those processes." 
====

The Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) 2.0 specification is an OMG specification that not only defines a standard on how to graphically represent a business process (like BPMN 1.x), but now also includes execution semantics for the elements defined, and an XML format on how to store (and share) process definitions.

jBPM6 allows you to execute processes defined using the BPMN 2.0 XML format.
That means that you can use all the different jBPM6 tooling to model, execute, manage and monitor your business processes using the BPMN 2.0 format for specifying your executable business processes.
Actually, the full BPMN 2.0 specification also includes details on how to represent things like choreographies and collaboration.
The jBPM project however focuses on that part of the specification that can be used to specify executable processes.

Executable processes in BPMN consist of a different types of nodes being connected to each other using sequence flows.
The BPMN 2.0 specification defines three main types of nodes:

* __Events__: They are used to model the occurrence of a particular event.
  This could be a start event (that is used to indicate the start of the process), end events (that define the end of the process, or of that subflow) and intermediate events (that indicate events that might occur during the execution of the process).
* __Activities__: These define the different actions that need to be performed during the execution of the process.
  Different types of tasks exist, depending on  the type of activity you are trying to model (e.g.
  human task, service task, etc.) and activities could also be nested (using different types of sub-processes).
* __Gateways__: Can be used to define multiple paths in the process.
  Depending on the type of gateway, these might indicate parallel execution, choice, etc.

jBPM6 does not implement all elements and attributes as defined in the BPMN 2.0 specification.
We do however support a significant subset, including the most common node types that can be used inside executable processes.
This includes (almost) all elements and attributes as defined in the "Common Executable" subclass of the BPMN 2.0 specification, extended with some additional elements and attributes we believe are valuable in that context as well.
The full set of elements and attributes that are supported can be found below, but it includes elements like:

* _Flow objects_

** Events 
+
*** Start Event (None, Conditional, Signal, Message, Timer)
*** End Event (None, Terminate, Error, Escalation, Signal, Message, Compensation)

*** Non-interrupting Boundary Event (Escalation, Signal, Timer, Conditional, Message)
*** Interrupting Boundary Event (Escalation, Error, Signal, Timer, Conditional, Message, Compensation)

*** Task
*** Service Task
*** User Task
*** Business Rule Task

*** Receive Task
*** Reusable Sub-Process (Call Activity)

**** Exclusive

** Embedded Sub-Process properties
** Activity properties

** Sequence flow


For example, consider the following "Hello World" BPMN 2.0 process, which does nothing more that writing out a "Hello World" statement when the process is started.

An executable version of this process expressed using BPMN 2.0 XML would look something like this:

[source,xml]

To create your own process using BPMN 2.0 format, you can 

* The jBPM Designer is an open-source web-based editor that supports the BPMN 2.0 format. We have embedded it into jbpm console for BPMN 2.0 process visualization and editing. You could use the Designer (either standalone or integrated) to create / edit BPMN 2.0 processes and then export them to BPMN 2.0 format or save them into repository and import them so they can be executed.
* A new BPMN2 Eclipse plugin is being created to support the full BPMN2 specification.
* You can always manually create your BPMN 2.0 process files by writing the XML directly. You can validate the syntax of your processes against the BPMN 2.0 XSD, or use the validator in the Eclipse plugin to check both syntax and completeness of your model.
* {empty}

[NOTE]
====
Drools Eclipse Process editor has been deprecated in favor of BPMN2 Modeler for process modeling.
It can still be used for limited number of supported elements but should be faced out as it is not being developed any more.
====
+ 
Create a new Process file using the Drools Eclipse plugin wizard and in the last page of the wizard, make sure you select Drools 5.1 code compatibility.
This will create a new process using the BPMN 2.0 XML format.
Note however that this is not exactly a BPMN 2.0 editor, as it still uses different attributes names etc.
It does however save the process using valid BPMN 2.0 syntax.
Also note that the editor does not support all node types and attributes that are already supported in the execution engine.
 

The following code fragment shows you how to load a BPMN2 process into your knowledge base ...

[source,java]
----

private static KnowledgeBase createKnowledgeBase() throws Exception {
    KieHelper kieHelper = new KieHelper();
    KieBase kieBase = kieHelper
    .addResource(ResourceFactory.newClassPathResource("sample.bpmn2"))
    .build();

    return kieBase;
}
----

+...+ and how to execute this process ...

[source,java]
----
KieBase kbase = createKnowledgeBase();
KieSession ksession = kbase.newKieSession();
ksession.startProcess("com.sample.HelloWorld");
