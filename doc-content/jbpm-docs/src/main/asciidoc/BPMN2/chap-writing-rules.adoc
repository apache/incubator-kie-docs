* In the *Guided Rule* text box, enter the name of the rule, and click *OK*. You can check *Use Domain Specific Language (DSL)* to use DSL. For more information, see <<_the_domain_specific_language_editor>>.
. The new Guided Rule is now created under the selected project.


[[_sect_the_asset_editor]]
== Editing Rules

[[_the_asset_editor1]]
=== Editing Rules Using the Asset Editor


The asset editor provides access to information about assets and gives users the ability to edit assets.

The editor contains *Editor*, *Overview*, *Source*, and *Data Objects* tabs.

.Editor Tab
The *Editor* tab is where assets can be edited.
The available options in the edit tab will depend on the type of asset being edited.

.The Guided Decision Table - Editor Tab
image::3281.png[A screen shot of the asset editor - edit tab]

.Overview Tab
The Overview screen displays the generic data and version history of an asset.
It allows a user to edit other metadata details, add descriptions and discussions which are specific to a selected asset.

.The Guided Decision Table - Overview Tab
image::3449.png[A screen shot of the asset editor - Overview tab]


.Source Tab
Source tab shows the DRL source for a selected asset.

.The Guided Decision Table - Source Tab
image::3448.png[A screen shot of the asset editor - source tab]


.Data Objects Tab
The Data Objects tab suggests the set of imports used in the project. Each asset has its own imports and suggested fact types (that means data objects) that the user might want to use. See <<_creating_a_data_object>> for more information about data objects.

.The Guided Decision Table - Data Objects Tab
image::3625.png[A screen shot of the asset editor - config tab]


[[_business_rules_with_the_guided_editor]]
=== Business Rules with the Guided Rule Editor


Business rules are edited in the Guided Rule Editor. The Guided Rule Editor prompts users for input based on the object model of the rule being edited.

Assets used in a rule that belong to a different package must be imported into the rule. Assets in the same package are imported by default. Define your imports in the *Data Objects* tab.

.The Guided Rule Editor
====
image::1140.png[A screen shot of the guided editor]

The Guided Rule Editor consists of the *When* and *Then* parts. Under the *Then* part is a *(show options...)* link that enables you to set additional rule attributes, such as ruleflow-group, salience, and similar. For more information about the Guided Rule Editor, see <<_the_guided_rule_template>>.

.Rule Attributes
image::1141.png[Guided Editor Rule Attributes]

[[_narrowing_facts_using_package_white_list]]
=== Narrowing Facts Using Package White List

You can narrow down the facts available during rule creation and modification by using a file called `package-names-white-list`. Use this file to narrow down a group of facts that are loaded and are visible. This helps to speed up the loading of these facts while creating new rules.

When you create a new project in the root directory, an empty `package-names-white-list` file is automatically created along with the `pom.xml` and `project.imports` project files.
For existing projects, create the `package-names-white-list` file manually. In Business Central, you can view the file through the repository view of a project in the *Project Explorer*.

By default (when the file is empty), all the facts within the project itself are visible while those from the project's dependencies are restricted.

[float]
==== Rules for Defining Packages

The `package-names-white-list` file is a text file that accepts single package names on each line. Packages can contain wildcards, for example:

* com.redhat.finance: allows facts from _only_ the [package]#com.redhat.finance# package. Thus, [class]``com.redhat.finance.Person`` and [class]``com.redhat.finance.Salary`` are allowed, but [class]``com.redhat.finance.senior.Management`` are not allowed.
* com.redhat.finance.*: allows facts from the sub-packages of the [package]#com.redhat.finance# package __only__. Thus, [class]``com.redhat.finance.senior.Management`` and [class]``com.redhat.finance.junior.Management`` are allowed, but _not_ [class]``com.redhat.finance.Person``.
* com.redhat.finance.**: this is a combination of the above two rules. Allows [class]``com.redhat.finance.Person`` and [class]``com.redhat.finance.senior.Management`` and even, [class]``com.redhat.finance.really.senior.Management`` classes.

You can include specific packages from a dependency by adding appropriate entries into the `package-names-white-list`
 file.
You can also include or remove all packages from specific dependencies.
For more information, see <<_adding_dependencies1,Adding Dependencies>>.

[[_the_anatomy_of_a_rule1]]
=== The Anatomy of a Rule


A rule consists of multiple parts:

When::
The when part of the rule is the condition that must be met.
For instance, a bank providing credit in the form of a loan may specify that customers must be over twenty-one years of age.
This would be represented by using when to determine if the customer is over twenty-one years of age.
Then::
The then part of the rule is the action to be performed when the conditional part of the rule has been met.
For instance, when the customer is under twenty-one years of age, then decline the loan because the applicant is under age.
Optional::
+
Optional attributes such as salience can be defined on rules.


With the Guided Rule Editor, it is possible to add more conditions to the when (conditional) part of the rule and more actions to the then (action) part of the rule.
For instance, if an applicant under the age of 21 had a guarantor for a loan application, the bank may decide to approve the loan application.

[[_saliance]]
=== Salience


Each rule has a salience value which is an integer value that defaults to zero.
The salience value represents the priority of the rule with higher salience values representing higher priority.
Salience values can be positive or negative.

[[_adding_conditions_or_actions_to_rules]]
=== Adding Conditions or Actions to Rules

.Procedure: Adding Conditions or Actions to Rules
. Click the plus icon in the When section of the Guided Rule Editor to add a condition, or click the plus icon in the Then section of the Guided Rule Editor to add an action.
. Select the condition or action from the menu and click *Ok*. If the package the rule belongs to has been configured to include DSL (Domain Specific Language) sentences, DSL sentences can be chosen from the menu.
. If the condition or action requires input, i.e., a date, true or false, am integer, or other input type, enter the required value.


[[_adding_a_field_to_a_fact_type]]
=== Adding a Field to a Fact Type


With the Guided Rule Editor, it is possible to add more conditions to the when (conditional) part of the rule and more actions to the then (action) part of the rule.
For instance, if a loan applicant under the age of 21 had a guarantor for a loan application, the bank may decide to approve the loan application.

To add the guarantor to the condition, first add the *guarantor* field to the application fact type (Data Object in Business Central) of the mortgage model. For further information about how to add a field to a fact type, see <<data_modeler>>.

With the guarantor field now added to the applicant fact type,  you can modify the rule to include a guarantor as a condition.

[[_technical_rules_drl]]
=== Technical Rules (DRL)


Technical (DRL) rules are stored as text and can be managed in the {PRODUCT} user interface.
A DRL file can contain one or more rules. The condition and the action of the rule are the when and then parts of the rule respectively.

Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio provides tools for creating, editing, and debugging DRL files, and it should be used for these purposes.
However, DRL rules can be managed within the {PRODUCT} user interface.
The DRL editor provides syntax highlighting for Java, DRL, and XML.

.An Example Technical Rule (DRL)
[source,java]
----
rule "approval"
  salience 100 // This can short-circuit any processing.
  when
    a : Approve()
    p : Policy()
  then
    p.setApproved(true);
    System.out.println("APPROVED:" + a.getReason());
end

[[_spreadsheet_decision_tables]]
=== Spreadsheet Decision Tables


Rules can be stored in spreadsheet decision tables.
Each row in the spreadsheet is a rule, and each column is either a condition, an action, or an option.
The [ref]_Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite Development Guide_
 provides details for using decision tables.

[[_uploading_spreadsheet_decision_tables]]
=== Uploading Spreadsheet Decision Tables

[[_sect_web_based_guided_decision_tables]]
== Web Based Guided Decision Tables

[[_web_based_guided_decision_tables1]]
=== Web Based Guided Decision Tables


The (web based) Guided Decision Table feature works similar to the Guided Editor by introspecting what facts and fields are available to guide the creation of a decision table.

Rule attributes, meta-data, conditions and actions can be defined in a tabular format thus facilitating rapid entry of large sets of related rules.
Web based decision table rules are compiled into DRL like all other rule assets.

To create a new decision table, click on *New Item* -> *Guided Decision Table*.
Enter the name of the table and select whether you want the extended entry or limited entry table (<<_types_of_decision_table>>). Optionally select to use the Guided Decision Table Wizard.


image::6326.png[]


Click *OK* when done. If you didn't select the wizard, you will be presented with the editor for Guided Decision Tables.
If you selected the wizard, you will be presented with the first screen of the wizard.


image::6328.png[]


The wizard helps you define your imports, facts, patterns and columns, but not the rows.
Rows are added in the Guided Decision Table Editor, which is what you are presented with at the end of the wizard (or directly if you didn't use the wizard).


image::6327.png[]

When you build your own application comprising guided decision tables, ensure that you have the necessary dependencies added to your class path. For more information about dependencies for guided decision tables, see the _Dependency Management for Guided Decision Tables, Scorecards, and Rule Templates_ section of the  _Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite Development Guide_. 

[[_types_of_decision_table]]
=== Types of decision tables


There are broadly two types of decision tables, both of which are supported:

* Extended Entry
* Limited Entry


.Extended entry
An Extended Entry decision table is one for which the column definitions specify Pattern, Field and operator but not value.
The values, or states, are themselves held in the body of the decision table.
It is normal, but not essential, for the range of possible values to be restricted by limiting entry to values from a list.
Business central supports use of Java enumerations or decision table "optional value lists" to restrict value entry.

.Limited entry
A Limited Entry decision table is one for which the column definitions specify value in addition to Pattern, Field and operator.
The decision table states, held in the body of the table, are boolean where a positive value (a checked tick-box) has the effect of meaning the column should apply, or be matched.
A negative value (a cleared tick-box) means the column does not apply.

[[_column_configuration1]]
=== Column Configuration

For a description of column constraint types, see <<_condition_columns>>. 

You can set a default value, but normally if there is no value in the cell, that constraint will not apply.

.Column Configuration
image::1163.png[" Within the Options section under the Decision table, the user has the ability to set a default value."]


[[_adding_columns]]
=== Adding Columns


To add a column within the Guided Decision Table Editor, click on the image:5805.png[New Column]
 icon.

The following column type selection dialog appears:

.Advanced Column Options
image::5804.png[Add column pop-up for Guided Decision Tables in BRMS User Guide 6.0.2]


By default, the column type dialog shows the following types:

* Add a new Metadata\Attribute column
* Add a simple Condition
* Set the value of a field
* Set the value of a field on a new fact
* Delete an existing fact


Clicking on "Include advanced options" adds the following options:

* Add a Condition BRL fragment
* Execute a Work Item
* Set the value of a field with a Work Item parameter
* Set the value of a field on a new Fact with a Work Item parameter
* Add an action BRL fragment


[[_sect_column_types]]
=== Column Types

[[_attribute_columns]]
==== Attribute Columns


You can have zero or more attribute columns representing any of the DRL rule attributes. For example:

[source,java]
----
rule "Rule1"
salience 100 // This rule has the highest priority
when
  $c : Cheese( name == "Cheddar" )
then
  ...
end
----

For a list of attributes, see the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_bpm_suite/6.4/html-single/development_guide/#rule_set_entries[Rule Set Entries] chapter of the _Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite Development Guide_.

[[_metadata_columns]]
==== Metadata Columns


Zero or more meta-data columns can be defined, each represents the normal meta-data annotation on DRL rules.
To add meta-data: 

. Click *New column*, then select *Add a new Metadata\Attribute column*.
. Fill the *Metadata* field, then click the plus button (image:5686.png[]) to add the meta-data.

.Attribute and Meta-Data Option
image::5806.png[Attribute and Meta Data option for the Guided Decision Table in the BRMS User Guide 6.0.2]


[[_condition_columns]]
==== Condition Columns


Conditions represent fact patterns defined in the left-hand side, or when portion, of a rule.
To define a condition column, you must define a binding to a model class or select one that has previously been defined. You can also choose to negate the pattern:

[source,java]
----
when
  $c : Cheese( name == "Cheddar" ) //Binds the Cheese object to the $c variable
then
  ...
end
----

[source,java]
----
when
  not Cheese( name == "Cheddar" ) //Negates matching pattern
then
  ...
end
----

Once this has been completed, you can define field constraints.
If two or more columns are defined using the same fact pattern binding, the field constraints become composite field constraints on the same pattern.
If you define multiple bindings for a single model class, each binding becomes a separate model class in the left-hand side of the rule.

When you edit or create a new column, you will be given a choice of the type of constraint:

* Literal: The value in the cell will be compared with the field using the operator.
* Formula: The expression in the cell will be evaluated and then compared with the field.
* Predicate: No field is needed, the expression will be evaluated to true or false.


.Simple Condition Column
image::5807.png[Condition Column for Guided Decision Table Editor in the BRMS User Guide 6.0.2]


[[_field_value_columns]]
==== Field Value Columns


This column creates an action to set the value of a field on a previously bound fact.
You have the option to notify the rule engine of the modified values which could lead to other rules being re-activated.

.Set the value of a field
image::5808.png[Field Value column for the Guided Decision Table Editor in BRMS User Guide 6.0.2]


[[_new_fact_field_value_columns]]
==== New Fact Field Value Columns


This column enables an action to insert a new fact (object) into the working memory of the rule engine. You can also define the value of one or more of the fields of the new fact.
You can _logically insert_ the new fact. When you logically insert a fact, the inserted fact will be retracted as soon as the condition of rule that inserted the fact is no longer true. See the _Red Hat JBoss Development Guide_ for information about truth maintenance and logical insertions.

=== Advanced Column Types

[[_condition_brl_fragment_columns]]
==== Condition BRL Fragment Columns


A construct that allows a BRL fragment to be used in the left-hand side of a rule.
A BRL fragment is authored using the Guided Rule Editor and hence all features available in that editor can be used to define a decision table column such as the following: "from", "collect", and "accumulate". When using the embedded Guided Rule Editor, field values defined as "Template Keys" will form columns in the decision table.
Facts and Fact's fields bound in the BRL fragment can be referenced by the simpler column types and vice-versa.

The following example displays a BRL Condition for a shopping tier.

.Add a Condition BRL fragment

[[_execute_work_item_columns]]
==== Execute Work Item Columns


This implements an action to invoke a Red Hat JBoss Business Process Management Suite work item handler.
It sets its input parameters to bound Facts/Facts' fields values.
This works for any work item definition.

[[_field_value_with_work_item_parameter_columns]]
==== Field Value with Work Item Parameter Columns


This implements an action that sets the value of a fact field to the value of a result parameter of a Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite work item handler.
The work item must define a result parameter of the same data type as a field on a bound fact; this will allow you to set the field to the return parameter.

.Set the Value of a Field with a Work Item Parameter
image::5817.png[Field Value with Work Item Parameter in Guided Decision Table Editor in BRMS User Guide 6.0.2]


[NOTE]
====
To set the *Bind field to Work Item* option, you first must have an action that executes a work item.
This will allow you to set the field of an existing Fact based on a work item's results.
====

[[_new_fact_field_value_with_work_item_parameter_columns]]
==== New Fact Field Value with Work Item Parameter Columns

This implements an action that sets the value of a fact field to the value of a result parameter of a Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite work item handler. The work item must define a result parameter of the same data type as a field on a bound fact type. In such case, you can set the field to the return parameter.

.Set the value of a field on a new Fact with a Work Item parameter.

[[_action_brl_fragment_columns]]
==== Action BRL Fragment Columns


A construct that allows a BRL fragment to be used in the right-hand side of a rule.
A BRL fragment is authored using the Guided Rule Editor and hence all features available in that editor can be used to define a decision table column.
When using the embedded Guided Rule Editor, field values defined as "Template Keys" will form columns in the decision table.
Facts bound in the BRL fragment can be referenced by the simpler column types and vice-versa.

.Simple layout for Adding an Action BRL fragment

[[_rule_definition]]
=== Rule Definition


Rules are created in the main body of the decision table using the columns that have already been defined.

Rows of rules can be added or deleted by clicking the plus or minus symbols respectively.

.Rule Definition
image::1183.png[ A screen shot of a decision table.]


[[_cell_merging1]]
=== Cell Merging


The icon in the top left of the decision table toggles cell merging on and off.
When cells are merged, those in the same column with identical values are merged into a single cell.
This simplifies changing the value of multiple cells that shared the same original value.
When cells are merged, they also gain an icon in the top-left of the cell that allows rows spanning the merged cell to be grouped.

.Cell Merging
image::1185.png[ A table demonstrating the merging of cells.]


[[_cell_grouping1]]
=== Cell Grouping


Cells that have been merged can be further collapsed into a single row.
Clicking the [+\-] icon in the top left of a merged cell collapses the corresponding rows into a single entry.
Cells in other columns spanning the collapsed rows that have identical values are shown unchanged.
Cells in other columns spanning the collapsed rows that have different values are highlighted and the first value displayed.

.Cell Grouping
image::1186.png[ This table shows how cells can be grouped using the +\- options.]


When the value of a grouped cell is altered, all cells that have been collapsed also have their values updated.

[[_otherwise_operations1]]
=== Otherwise Operations


Condition columns defined with literal values that use either the equality `==` or inequality `!=` operators can take advantage of a special decision table cell value of ``otherwise``.
This special value allows a rule to be defined that matches on all values not explicitly defined in all other rules defined in the table.
This is best illustrated with an example:

[source]
----
when
  Cheese( name not in ("Cheddar", "Edam", "Brie") )
  ...
then
  ...
end
----

[source]
----
when
  Cheese( name in ("Cheddar", "Edam", "Brie") )
  ...
then
  ...
end
----

To use the `otherwise` keyword:

. Select a cell of a condition column that uses the `==` or `!=` operator.
. Click *Otherwise*.

[[_sect_rule_templates]]
== Rule Templates

[[_the_guided_rule_template]]
=== The Guided Rule Template


Rule Templates enable you to define a rule structure. They provide a place-holder for values and data, and they populate templates to generate many rules. From the user's perspective, Guided Rule Templates are parametrized guided rules that contain a data table which provides parameter values. The templates enable more flexible decision tables and can enhance the flexibility of rules in existing databases. For information about managing dependencies of Rule Templates, see the _Dependency Management for Guided Decision Tables, Scorecards, and Rule Templates_ section of the  _Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite Development Guide_. 

.Procedure: Creating a new Guided Rule Template

[[_the_domain_specific_language_editor]]
== The Domain Specific Language Editor


The domain specific language feature enables you to define language that is specific to your problem domain. You, or business analyst users, can then create rules using only the predefined language. This simplifies the process of rule creation for users without deep knowledge of rules and the rule language. Sentence constructed from domain specific languages (or DSL sentences) can be edited in the DSL editor. See the _Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite Development Guide_ for more information about domain specific languages.
The DSL syntax is extended to provide hints to control how the DSL variables are rendered. The following hints are supported:

* {<varName>:<regular expression>}
+
This will render a text field in place of the DSL variable when the DSL sentence is used in the guided editor.
The content of the text field will be validated against the regular expression.
* {<varName>:ENUM:<factType.fieldName>}
+
This will render an enumeration in place of the DSL variable when the DSL sentence is used in the guided editor.
<factType.fieldName> binds the enumeration to the model fact and field enumeration definition.
This could be either a Knowledge Base enumeration or a Java enumeration, i.e., defined in a model POJO JAR file.
* {<varName>:DATE:<dateFormat>}
+
This will render a date selector in place of the DSL variable when the DSL sentence is used in the guided editor.
* {<varName>:BOOLEAN:<[checked | unchecked]>}
+
This will render a dropdown selector in place of the DSL variable, providing boolean choices, when the DSL sentence is used in the guided editor.

== Data Enumerations

[[_data_enumerations_drop_down_list_configuration1]]
=== Data Enumerations Drop-Down List Configuration


Data enumerations are an optional type of asset that can be configured to provide drop-down lists for the Guided Decision Table Editor. Double-click on a cell to view the enumeration drop-down list if the cell condition is based the same fact and field as the enumeration.

image::user-guide-enumeration_gdst.png[]

They are stored and edited just like any other asset and only apply to the package they are created in.

The contents of an enumeration configuration are the mapping of a `fact.field` to a list of values.
These values are used to populate the drop-down menu.
The list can either be literal or use a utility class (which must be added to the classpath) to load the strings.
The strings contain either a value to be shown in the drop-down menu or a mapping from the code value (which is what is used in the rule) and a display value, e.g., M=Mini.

.An Example Enumeration Configuration
====
[source]
----
'Board.type' : [ 'Short', 'Long', 'M=Mini', 'Boogie']
'Person.age' : [ '20', '25', '30', '35' ]
----

This can be also be configured in Business Central as follows:

[[_advanced_enumeration_concepts1]]
=== Advanced Enumeration Concepts


Drop-down lists are dependent on field values.
With enumerations it is possible to define multiple options based on other field values.

A fact model for insurance policies could have a class called Insurance, consisting of the fields, `policyType` and ``coverage``.
The choices for `policyType` could be `Home` or ``Car``.
The type of insurance policy will determine the type of coverage that will be available.
A home insurance policy could include `property` or ``liability``.
A car insurance policy could include `collision` or ``fullCoverage``.

The field value policyType determines which options will be presented for coverage, and it is expressed as follows:

[source]
----

 'Insurance.policyType' : ['Home', 'Car']
 'Insurance.coverage[policyType=Home]' : ['property', 'liability']
 'Insurance.coverage[policyType=Car]' : ['collision', 'fullCoverage']
----

[[_obtaining_data_lists_from_external_sources]]
=== Obtaining Data Lists from External Sources


A list of Strings from an external source can be retrieved and used in an enumeration menu.
This is achieved by adding code to the classpath that returns a [class]``java.util.List`` (of strings). Instead of specifying a list of values in the user interface, the code can return the list of strings.
(As normal, you can use the "=" sign inside the strings if you want to use a different display value to the rule value.) For example, you could use the following:

[source]
----
'Person.age' : ['20','25', '30', '35']
----


To:

[source]
----
'Person.age' : (new com.yourco.DataHelper()).getListOfAges()
----


This assumes you have a class called [class]``DataHelper`` which has a method [method]``getListOfAges()`` which returns a list of strings.
The data enumerations are loaded the first time the guided editor is used in a session.
To check the enumeration has loaded, go to the package configuration screen.
You can "save and validate" the package; this will check it and provide feedback about any errors.

[[_sect_scorecards]]
== Scorecards

[[_scorecards]]
=== Scorecards


Scorecard is a Risk Management tool which is a graphical representation of a formula used to calculate an overall score.
It is mostly used by financial institutions or banks to calculate the risk they can take to sell a product in market.
Thus it can predict the likelihood or probability of a certain outcome.
{PRODUCT} now supports additive scorecards that calculates an overall score by adding all partial scores assigned to individual rule conditions.

Additionally, Drools Scorecards allows for reason codes to be set, which help in identifying the specific rules (buckets) that have contributed to the overall score.
Drools Scorecards will be based on the PMML 4.1 Standard.

In general, a scorecard can be created more or less in this way:

. A statistical analysis is performed on the historical data which is usually collected from the existing customer database.
. A predictive or probable characteristics (attributes or pieces of information) are identified based on this analysis.
. Each characteristics are then broken down into ranges of possible values which are then given a score.


To explain it in detail, following is an example:

.Scorecard Example

[[_creating_a_scorecard]]
=== Creating a Scorecard

.Procedure: Creating a new Score Card (Spreadsheet)
. Open the *Project Authoring* perspective: on the main menu, click *Authoring* -> *Project Authoring*.
. In the *Project Explorer* view, do the following:
+
.. If in the Project view of Project Explorer, select the organizational unit, repository and the project where you want to create the score card.
.. If in the Repository view of Project Explorer, navigate to the project root, where you want to create the score card.
. In the perspective menu, go to *New Item* -> *Score Card (Spreadsheet)*.
. In the *Create new Score Card (Spreadsheet)* dialog window, define the package details:
+
.. In the *Resource Name* text box, enter the score card name.
.. Click on *Choose File* and browse to the location to select the spreadsheet in which the score card is initially created.
. Click *OK*.
. The new score card spreadsheet is created under the selected project.

When you build your own application comprising guided scorecards, ensure that you have the necessary dependencies added to your classpath. For more information about dependencies for guided decision tables, see the _Dependency Management for Guided Decision Tables, Scorecards, and Rule Templates_ section of the  _Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite Development Guide_.

== Guided Decision Trees

A decision tree is a graphical representation of a decision model in a tree-like manner. You can create simple decision trees in Business Central with flat data object models. The editor does not support nested data objects.

The editor offers a palette on the left-hand side (with available data objects, fields and corresponding actions) and a working area on the right-hand side where you can drag and drop the data objects to build a decision tree.
You can use connectors and applicable child objects prompted by the editor, to complete your tree. You can manipulate each node using its `Delete`, `Edit`, and `Collapse` icons. 

While creating a decision tree, you must remember the following points:

* A tree must have a data object at the root.
* A tree can only have one root.
* Data objects can have other data objects, field constraints, or actions as children.
* The field constraints must be on fields of the same data object as the parent node.
* Field constraints can have either other field constraints or actions as children.
* The field constraints must be on fields of the same data object as the parent node.
* Actions can only have other actions as children.

== Verification and Validation of Guided Decision Tables


In Business Central, the guided decision tables are a way of representing conditional logic (rule) in a precise manner, and they are well suited to business level rules.

=== Introduction


Business Central provides verification and validation feature to help ensure that a guided decision table is complete and error free.
The feature looks for gaps in the logic of a guided decision table and validates the relationship between different cells.
Most of the issues that the Business Central verification and validation feature reports are gaps in the author's logic.
The verification and validation feature does not prevent you from saving your work if you choose to ignore the verification and validation notifications.

When you edit a guided decision table, the verification and validation feature notifies you if you do something wrong.
For example, if you forget to set an action for a row of the guided decision table or if you have a duplicate row, a new panel, Analysis, will open in the Business Central with a notification about the issue.
The Analysis panel presents a list of issues found in the guided decision table, each item also pointing out the affected guided decision table rows.
If you select an item in the list of issues, you will see a more in-depth description of the problem.

The validation and verification feature helps you resolve issues around:

* Redundancy
+
Redundancy happens when two rows in a decision table execute the same consequences for the same set of facts.
For example, two rows checking a client's birthday and providing a birthday discount may result in double discount.
* Subsumption
+
Subsumption is similar to redundancy and exists when two rules execute the same consequences, but one executes on a subset of facts of the other.
For example, these two rules:

** when Person age > 10 then Increase Counter
** when Person age > 20 then Increase Counter

+
In this case, if a person is 15 years old, only one rule fires and if a person is 20 years old, both rules fire.
Such cases cause similar trouble during runtime as redundancy.
* Conflicts
+
A conflicting situation occurs when two similar conditions have different consequences.
Sometimes, there may be conflicts between two rows (rules) or two cells in a decision table.
+
The example below illustrates conflict between two rows in a decision table:

** when Deposit > 20000 then Approve Loan
** when Deposit > 20000 then Refuse Loan

+
In this case, there is no way to know if the loan will be approved or not.
+
The example below illustrates conflict between two cells in a decision table:

** When Age > 25
** When Age < 25

+
A row with conflicting cells never execute.
* Defiency
+
Defiency is similar to a conflict and occurs due to incompleteness in the logic of a rule in a decision table.
For example, consider the following two deficient rules:

** when Age > 20 then Approve Loan
** when Deposit < 20000 then Refuse Loan

+
These two rules may lead to confusion for a person who is over 20 years old and have deposited less than 20000.
You may add more constraints to avoid the conflict after noticing the warning to make your rule logic complete.
* Missing Columns
+
In some cases, usually by accident, the user can delete all the condition or action columns.
When the conditions are removed all the actions are executed and when the actions columns are missing the rows do nothing.
Both may or may not be by design, usually though this is a mistake.


=== Reporting


The verification and validation feature of Business Central reports different issue levels in the Analysis panel while you are updating a guided decision table.

* image:gdtValidationVerificationIconError.png[] Error: This means a serious fault, which may lead to the guided decision table failing to work as designed at run time. Conflicts, for example, are reported as errors.
* image:gdtValidationVerificationIconWarning.png[] Warning: This is most likely a serious fault, however they may not prevent the guided decision table from working but need to be double checked. Warnings are used e.g. for subsumption.
* image:gdtValidationVerificationIconInfo.png[] Information: This kind of issues might be a design decision of the author of the guided decision table as well as a simple accident. This is used e.g. for a row missing any condition.


[NOTE]
====
Business Central verification and validation does not prevent you from saving an incorrect change.
The feature only reports issues while editing and you can still continue to overlook those and save your changes.
====

=== Disabling Verification and Validation of Guided Decision Tables

The decision table verification and validation feature of Business Central is enabled by default. You can disable it by setting the `org.kie.verification.disable-dtable-realtime-verification` system property value to `true`.

For example, if you are using JBoss EAP as your application server, navigate to `$EAP_HOME` directory  and run the following command:

[source]
----
./standalone.sh -Dorg.kie.verification.disable-dtable-realtime-verification=true
----

Alternatively, set this property in the `standalone.xml` file: 

[source]
----
<property name="org.kie.verification.disable-dtable-realtime-verification" value="true"/>
----
