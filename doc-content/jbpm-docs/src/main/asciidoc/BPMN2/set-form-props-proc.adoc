Setting Properties of a Form Field in the forms designer

To set the properties of a form field, do the following:

. In Form Modeler, select the *Add fields by type* tab and click the arrow image:processes/4975.png[] button to the right of a field type. The field type is added to the canvas.
. On the canvas, place the cursor on the field and click the edit image:processes/5012.png[] icon.
. In the *Properties* dialog window that opens on the right, set the form field properties and click *Apply* at the bottom of the dialog window for HTML Labels. For other form field properties, the properties change once you have removed focus from the property that you are modifying.
