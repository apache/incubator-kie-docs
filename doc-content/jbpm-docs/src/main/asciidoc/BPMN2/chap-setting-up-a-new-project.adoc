[[_chap_setting_up_a_new_project]]
= Setting up a New Project


To create a project a business user has to create an organizational unit.
An organizational unit is based on any domain in a particular business sector.
It holds the repositories, where projects and packages can be created.
Packages are deployable collections of assets like rules, fact models, decision tables and so on, that can be validated and compiled for deployment.

== Creating an Organizational Unit


It is possible to create an organizational unit in the *Administration* perspective of Business Central, using the `kie-config-cli` tool, or the REST API calls.

[float]
==== ⁠Creating an Organizational Unit in Business Central

[IMPORTANT]
====
Note that only users with the `admin` role in Business Central can create organizational units.
====

.Procedure: Using Business Central to Create an Organizational Unit
. In Business Central, go to *Authoring* -> *Administration*.
. On the perspective menu, click *Organizational Units* -> *Manage Organizational Units*.
. In the *Organization Unit Manager* view, click *Add*.

. Enter the two mandatory parameters (`name` and `default group ID`) and click *Ok*.


[float]
==== ⁠Creating an Organizational Unit Using the kie-config-cli Tool


Organizational units can be created using the `kie-config-cli` tool as well. To do so, run the `create-org-unit` command.
The tool then guides you through the entire process of creating an organizational unit by asking for other required parameters.
Type `help` for a list of all commands.

[[_defining_kie_bases_and_sessions]]
== Defining KIE Bases and Sessions


A _KIE base_ is a repository of the application's knowledge definitions. It contains rules, processes, functions, and type models. A KIE base does not contain runtime data, instead sessions are created from the KIE base into which data can be inserted and process instances started.

A _KIE session_ stores runtime data created from a KIE base. See the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-jboss-bpm-suite/6.4/paged/development-guide/chapter-17-kie-api#sect_kie_sessions[KIE Sessions] chapter of the _Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite Development Guide_ for more information.


You can create KIE bases and sessions by editing the `kmodule.xml` project descriptor file of your project.You can do so through Business Central or by editing `kmodule.xml` in the `src/main/resources/META-INF/` folder by navigating through the `Repository` view.

[float]
=== Defining KIE Bases and Sessions in the Project Editor


To define a KIE base or session in Business Central, do the following:

. Click *Authoring* -> *Project Authoring* and navigate to your project.
. In the *Project Explorer* window, click *Open Project Editor*.
. Click *Project Settings: Project General Settings* -> *Knowledge bases and sessions*. This view provides a user interface for changing `kmodule.xml`.
. Click *Add* to define and add your bases.
+
.. After you enter a name for your Knowledge Base, add Packages. For including all packages, click *Add* below *Packages* and enter asterisk ``*``.
. Below *Knowledge Sessions*, click *Add* and enter the name of your session.
. Mark it `Default` and select appropriate state.
+
For Red Hat JBoss BRMS, you can choose between `stateful` and `stateless` sessions. Use `stateless` if you do not need iterative invocations of the facts. Otherwise, use `stateful` session.
. Click *Save* in the top right corner once you are done.


[float]
=== Defining KIE Bases and Sessions in kmodule.xml


To define a KIE base or session by editing `kmodule.xml`, do the following:

. Open the repository view for your project.
+
.Changing to Repository View
image::5191.png[]
. Navigate to `/src/main/resources/META-INF` . Click on `kmodule.xml` to edit the file directly.
. Define your `kbases` and ``ksessions``. For example:
+
[source,xml]
----
<kmodule xmlns="http://www.drools.org/xsd/kmodule" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
  <kbase name="myBase" default="true" eventProcessingMode="stream" equalsBehavior="identity" packages="*">
    <ksession name="mySession" type="stateless" default="true" clockType="realtime"/>
  </kbase>
</kmodule>
----
. Click *save* in the top right corner.


You can switch between the Project Editor view and the Repository view to look at the changes you make in each view.
To do so, close and reopen the view each time a change is made.

[[_creating_a_resource]]
== Creating a Resource


A Project may contain an arbitrary number of packages, which contain files with resources, such as Process definition, Work Item definition, Form definition, Business Rule definition, etc.

To create a resource, select the Project and the package in the *Project Explorer*
 and click menu:New Item[]
 on the perspective menu and select the resource you want to create.

.Creating packages
[NOTE]
====
It is recommended to create your resources, such as Process definitions, Work Item definitions, Data Models, etc., inside a package of a Project to allow importing of resources and referencing their content.

To create a package, do the following:

* In the *Repository* view of the Project Explorer, navigate to the `REPOSITORY/PROJECT/src/main/resources/` directory.
* Go to *New Item* -> *Package*.
* In the *New resource* dialog, define the package name and check the location of the package in the repository.
