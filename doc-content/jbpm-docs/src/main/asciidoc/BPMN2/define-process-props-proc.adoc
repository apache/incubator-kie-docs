*<MH>Include content from sections Generic Properties of Visualized Process Elements and Defining Process Element Properties</MH>*

All process elements, including the process, contain a set of properties that define the following:

* _Core_ properties, which include properties such as the name, data set, scripts, and others.
* _Extra_ properties, which include the properties necessary for element execution, data mapping (variable mapping) and local variable definitions, and properties that represent an extension of the jBPM engine, such as ``onExitAction``, documentation, and similar.
* _Graphical_ properties, which include graphical representation of elements (such as colors, or text settings).
* _Simulation_ properties, which are used by the simulation engine.

In element properties of the String type, use `#{expression}` to embed a value.
The value will be retrieved on element instantiation, and the substitution expression will be replaced with the result of calling the [method]``toString()`` method on the variable defined in the expression.

Note that the expression can be the name of a variable, in which case it resolves to the value of the variable, but more advanced MVEL expressions are possible as well, for example ``#{person.name.firstname}``.

To define element properties, do the following:

. Open the process definition in the Process Designer.
. On the canvas, select an element.
. Click image:processes/3140.png[] in the upper right corner of the Process Designer to display the *Properties* view.
. In the displayed Properties view, click the property value fields to edit them. Note that where applicable, you can click the drop-down arrow and the relevant value editor appears in a new dialog box.
. Click *Save* in the upper right corner and fill out the *Save this item* dialogue to save your changes.
