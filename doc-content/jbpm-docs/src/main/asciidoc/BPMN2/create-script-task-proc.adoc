= Creating script tasks
Script tasks are used to execute a piece of code written in Java, JavaScript, or MVEL. They contain code snippets that specify the action of the script task. You can include global and process variables in your  scripts.

Note that MVEL accepts any valid Java code and additionally provides support for nested access of parameters. For example, the MVEL equivalent of the Java call `person.getName()` is `person.name`. MVEL also provides other improvements over Java and MVEL expressions are generally more convenient for business users.

| *Documentation*
| Enter a description of the task. The text in this field is included in the process documentation. Click the *Documentation* tab in the upper-left side of the process designer canvas to view the process documentation.

| *Script*
| Enter a script in Java, JavaScript, or MVEL to be executed by the task, and select the script type.


| *Is Async*
|  Select if this task should be invoked asynchronously. Make tasks asynchronous if they cannot be executed instantaneously, for example a task performed by an outside service.
