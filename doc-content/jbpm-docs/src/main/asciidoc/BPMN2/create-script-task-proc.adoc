= Creating script tasks
Script tasks are used to execute a piece of code written in Java, JavaScript, or MVEL. They contain code snippets that specify the action of the script task. You can include global and process variables in your  scripts.

You can write action scripts in Java, JavaScript, and MVEL. Note that MVEL accepts any valid Java code and additionally provides support for nested access of parameters. For example, the MVEL equivalent of the Java call `person.getName()` is `person.name. MVEL also provides other improvements over Java and MVEL expressions are generally more convenient for business users.
