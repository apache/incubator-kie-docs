= Form Modeler
{PRODUCT} provides a custom editor for defining forms called Form Modeler. With Form Modeler, you can generate forms for data objects, task forms, and process start forms without writing code. Form Modeler includes a widget library for binding multiple data types and a callback mechanism to send notifications when form values change. Form Modeler uses bean-based validation and supports binding form fields to static or dynamic models.

Form Modeler includes the following features:

* Form Modeling WYSIWYG UI for forms
* Form auto-generation from data model / Java objects
* Data binding for Java objects
* Formula and expressions
* Customized forms layouts
* Forms embedding

Form Modeler comes with predefined field types that you place onto the canvas to create a form.

//== Generating Forms from Task Definitions


//In the Process Designer module, you can generate forms automatically from task and variable definitions, and easily open concrete forms from Form Modeler by using the following menu option:

//.Generating Forms Automatically

//To open and edit a form directly, click the Edit Task Form icon (image:processes/5831.png[]) located above a user task.

//Forms follow a naming convention that relates them to tasks. If you define a form named `_TASK_NAME_-taskform` in the same package as the process, the human task engine will use the form to display and capture information entered by the user. If you create a form named ``_PROCESS_ID_-task``, the application will use it as the initial form when starting the process.

//== Editing Forms
//After you generate a form, you can start editing it. If the form has been generated automatically, the *Form data origin*  tab contains the process variables as the origin of the data, which enables you to bind form fields with them and create data bindings. Data bindings determine the way task input is mapped to form variables, and when the form is validated and submitted, the way values update output of the task. You can have as many data origins as required, and use different colors to differentiate them in the *Render color*  drop down menu. If the form has been generated automatically, the application creates a data origin for each process variable. For each data origin bindable item, there is a field in the form, and these automatically generated fields also have defined bindings. When you display the fields in the editor, the color of the data origin is displayed over the field to give you quick information on correct binding and implied data origin.

//To customize a form, you can for example move fields, add new fields, configure fields, or set values for object properties.

//== Moving a Field in Form Modeler


//You can place fields in different areas of the form.
//To move a field, access the field's contextual menu and select the *Move field*  option shown on the following screenshot. This option displays the different regions of the form where you can place the field.
