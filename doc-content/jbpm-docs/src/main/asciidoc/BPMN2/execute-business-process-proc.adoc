= Executing a business process in {CENTRAL}

After you build and deploy the project that contains your business process, you can execute the defined functionality for the business process.

As an example, this procedure uses the *Mortgage_Process* sample project in {CENTRAL}. In this scenario, you input data into a mortgage application form acting as the mortgage broker. The *MortgageApprovalProcess* business process runs and determines whether or not the applicant has offered an acceptable down payment based on the decision rules defined in the project. The business process either ends the rule testing or requests that the applicant increase the down payment to proceed. If the application passes the business rule testing, the bank approver reviews the application and either approves or denies the loan.

.Prerequisites
* {KIE_SERVER} is deployed and connected to {CENTRAL}.
