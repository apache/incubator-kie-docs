= Creating service tasks
A service task is a task that is part of the process that is executed outside of the process, but is not a human task. Examples of service tasks include sending an email and logging a message when these tasks are performed by systems. You can define the parameters (input) and results (output) that are associated with a service task. A Service Task should have one incoming connection and one outgoing connection.
