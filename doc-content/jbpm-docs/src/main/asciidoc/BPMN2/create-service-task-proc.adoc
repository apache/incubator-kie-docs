= Creating service tasks
A service task is a task that executes an action based on a web service call or in a Java class method. Examples of service tasks include sending an email and logging a message when these tasks are performed by systems. You can define the parameters (input) and results (output) that are associated with a service task. A Service Task should have one incoming connection and one outgoing connection.

.Procedure
. In {CENTRAL}, select the *Admin* icon in the top-right corner of the screen and select *Artifacts*.
. Click *Upload* to open the *Artifact upload* window.
. Choose the `.jar` file and click image:processes/upload-button.png[].
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The `.jar` file contains data types (data objects) and Java classes for web service and Java service tasks respectively.
====
. Create a project you want to use.
. Go to your project *Settings -> Dependencies*.
. Click *Add from repository*, locate the uploaded `.jar` file, and click *Select*.
. Open your project *Settings -> Work Item Handler*.
. Enter the following values in the given fields:
+
* *Name* - `Service Task`
* *Value* - `new org.jbpm.process.workitem.bpmn2.ServiceTaskHandler(ksession, classLoader)`

. Save the project.

.Example of creating web service task
The default implementation of a service task in the BPMN2 specification is a web service. The web service support is based on the Apache CXF dynamic client, which provides a dedicated service task handler that implements the `WorkItemHandler` interface:

`org.jbpm.process.workitem.bpmn2.ServiceTaskHandler`

To create a service task using web service, you must configure the web service:

.. Create a business process.
.. If necessary, in the upper-right corner of the screen, click the *Properties* icon.
.. Click image:processes/import-property-icon.png[] in the *Imports* property to open the *Imports* window.
.. Click *+Add* next to the *WSDL Imports* to import the required WSDL (Web Services Description Language) values. For example:
+
* *Location*: http://localhost:8080/sample-ws-1/SimpleService?wsdl
+
The location points to the WSDL file of your service.
+
* *Namespace*: http://bpmn2.workitem.process.jbpm.org/
+
The namespace must match `targetNamespace` from your WSDL file.

.. In the process designer, select the *Activities* tool from the tool palette.
.. Select *Service Task*.
.. Click a blank area of the process designer canvas.
.. Add or define the task information listed in the following table as required.

|===
|Label
|Description

| *Name*
| The name of the service task. You can also double-click the service task shape to edit the name.

| *Documentation*
| Enter a description of the task. The text in this field is included in the process documentation. Click the *Documentation* tab in the upper-left side of the process designer canvas to view the process documentation.

| *Implementation*
| Specify a web service.

| *Interface*
| The service used to implement the script, such as `CountriesPortService`.

| *Operation*
| The operation that is called by the interface, such as `getCountry`.

| *Assignments*
| Click to add local variables.

| *AdHoc Autostart*
| Select if this is an ad hoc task that should be started automatically. *AdHoc Autostart* enables the task to automatically start when the process or case instance is created instead of being starting by a start task. It is often used in case management.

| *Is Async*
|  Select if this task should be invoked asynchronously. Make tasks asynchronous if they cannot be executed instantaneously, for example a task performed by an outside service.

| *Is Multiple Instance*
| Select if this task has multiple instances.

| *MI Execution mode*
| Select if the multiple instances execute in parallel or sequentially.

| *MI Collection input*
| Specify a variable that represents a collection of elements for which new instances are created, such as `inputCountryNames`.

| *MI Data Input*
| Specify the input data assignment that is transferred to a web service, such as `Parameter`.

| *MI Collection output*
| The array list in which values returned from the web service task is stored, such as `outputCountries`.

| *MI Data Output*
| Specify the output data assignment for the web service task, which stores the result of class execution on the server, such as `Result`.

| *MI Completion Condition (mvel)*
| Specify the MVEL expression that is evaluated on each completed instance to check if the specified multiple instance node can complete.

| *On Entry Action*
| A Java, JavaScript, or MVEL script that specifies an action at the start of the task.

| *On Exit Action*
| A Java, JavaScript, or MVEL script that specifies an action at the end of the task.

| *SLA Due Date*
| The date that the service level agreement (SLA) expires.

.Example of creating Java service task
When you create a service task using Java method, then the method can only contain one parameter and returns a single value. To create a service task using a Java method, you must add the Java class to the dependencies of the project:

.. Create a business process.
.. In the process designer, select the *Activities* tool from the tool palette.
.. Select *Service Task*.
.. Click a blank area of the process designer canvas.
.. If necessary, in the upper-right corner of the screen, click the *Properties* icon.
.. Add or define the task information listed in the following table as required.

| *Documentation*
| Enter a description of the task. The text in this field is included in the process documentation. Click the *Documentation* tab in the upper-left side of the process designer canvas to view the process documentation.

| *Implementation*
| Specify the task is implemented in Java.

| *Interface*
| The class used to implement the script, such as `org.xyz.HelloWorld`.

| *Operation*
| The method that is called by the interface, such as `sayHello`.

| *Assignments*
| Click to add local variables.

| *AdHoc Autostart*
| Select if this is an ad hoc task that should be started automatically. *AdHoc Autostart* enables the task to automatically start when the process or case instance is created instead of being starting by a start task. It is often used in case management.

| *MI Collection input*
| Specify a variable that represents a collection of elements for which new instances are created, such as `InputCollection`.

| *MI Data Input*
| Specify the input data assignment that is transferred to a Java class. For example, you can set the input data assignments as `Parameter` and `ParameterType`. `ParameterType` represents the type of `Parameter` and sends arguments to the execution of Java method.

| *MI Collection output*
| The array list in which values returned from the Java class is stored, such as `OutputCollection`.

| *MI Data Output*
| Specify the output data assignment for Java service task, which stores the result of class execution on the server, such as `Result`.

| *MI Completion Condition (mvel)*
| Specify the MVEL expression that is evaluated on each completed instance to check if the specified multiple instance node can complete. For example, `OutputCollection.size() \<= 3` indicates more than three people are not addressed.

| *On Entry Action*
| A Java, JavaScript, or MVEL script that specifies an action at the start of the task.

| *On Exit Action*
| A Java, JavaScript, or MVEL script that specifies an action at the end of the task.

| *SLA Due Date*
| The date that the service level agreement (SLA) expires.
