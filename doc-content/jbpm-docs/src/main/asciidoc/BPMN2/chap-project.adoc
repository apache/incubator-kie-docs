A project is a container for asset packages (business processes, rules, work definitions, decision tables, fact models, data models, and DSLs) that lives in the Knowledge Repository.
It is this container that defines the properties of the KIE Base and KIE Session that are applied to its content.
In the GUI, you can edit these entities in the Project Editor.
endif::BPMS[]

As a project is a Maven project, it contains the Project Object Model file (`pom.xml`) with information on how to build the output artifact.
It also contains the Module Descriptor file, `kmodule.xml`, that contains the KIE Base and KIE Session configuration for the assets in the project.

== Adding Dependencies


To add dependencies to your project, do the following:

. Open the Project Editor for the given project:
+
.. In the *Project Explorer* view of the *Project Authoring* perspective, open the project directory.
.. Click *Open Project Editor* to open the project view.
. In the *Project Screen* view, select in the *Project Settings* drop-down box the *Dependencies* item.
. On the updated *Project Screen*, click the *Add* button to add a maven dependency or click the *Add from repository* button to add a dependency from the Knowledge Store (Artifact repository):
.. When adding a maven dependency, a user has to define the *Group ID*, *Artifact ID*, and the *Version ID* in the *Dependency* dialogue window.
.. When adding a dependency from the Knowledge Store, select the dependency in the displayed dialog box: the dependency will be added to the dependency table.
. To apply the various changes, the dependencies must be saved.


Additionally, you can use the *Package white list* when working with dependencies. When you add a repository, you can click the gear icon and select *Add all* or *Add none*, which results in including all or none of the packages from the added dependency.

[WARNING]
====
If working with modified artifacts, do not re-upload modified non-snapshot artifacts as Maven will not know these artifacts have been updated, and it will not work if it is deployed in this manner.
====

[[_defining_knowledge_base]]
== Defining KIE Bases and Sessions

A _KIE base_ is a repository of the application's knowledge definitions. It contains rules, processes, functions, and type models. A KIE base does not contain runtime data, instead sessions are created from the KIE base into which data can be inserted and process instances started.

A _KIE session_ stores runtime data created from a KIE base. See the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-jboss-bpm-suite/6.4/paged/development-guide/chapter-17-kie-api#sect_kie_sessions[KIE Sessions] chapter of the _Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite Development Guide_ for more information.

You can create KIE bases and sessions by editing the `kmodule.xml` project descriptor file of your project.
You can do so through Business Central or by editing `kmodule.xml` in the `src/main/resources/META-INF/` folder by navigating through the `Repository` view.

[float]
=== Defining KIE Bases and Sessions in the Project Editor


To define a KIE base or session in Business Central, do the following:

. Click *Authoring* -> *Project Authoring* and navigate to your project.
. In the *Project Explorer* window, click *Open Project Editor*.
. Click *Project Settings: Project General Settings* -> *Knowledge bases and sessions*. This view provides a user interface for changing `kmodule.xml`.
. Click *Add* to define and add your bases.
.. After you enter a name for your Knowledge Base, add Packages. For including all packages, click *Add* below *Packages* and enter asterisk `*`.
. Below *Knowledge Sessions*, click *Add* and enter the name of your session.
. Mark it `Default` and select appropriate state. For Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite, use `stateful` sessions.
. Click *Save* in the top right corner once you are done.


[float]
=== Defining KIE Bases and Sessions in kmodule.xml


To define a KIE base or session by editing `kmodule.xml`, do the following:

. Open the repository view for your project.
+

.Changing to Repository View
image::5191.png[]
. Navigate to `/src/main/resources/META-INF`. Click on `kmodule.xml` to edit the file directly.
. Define your `kbases` and ``ksessions``. For example:
+
[source,xml]
----
<kmodule xmlns="http://www.drools.org/xsd/kmodule" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
  <kbase name="myBase" default="true" eventProcessingMode="stream" equalsBehavior="identity" packages="*">
    <ksession name="mySession" type="stateless" default="true" clockType="realtime"/>
  </kbase>
</kmodule>
----
. Click *Save* in the top right corner.


You can switch between the Project Editor view and the Repository view to look at the changes you make in each view.
To do so, close and reopen the view each time a change is made.

[NOTE]
====
If you have more than one knowledge base, one of them must be marked __default__.
You also must define one default stateful knowledge session amongst all the bases and sessions.
Alternatively, you can define no knowledge bases.
====

[[_creating_a_resource]]
== Creating a Resource


A Project may contain an arbitrary number of packages, which contain files with resources, such as Process definition, Work Item definition, Form definition, Business Rule definition, etc.

To create a resource, select the Project and the package in the *Project Explorer*
 and click menu:New Item[]
 on the perspective menu and select the resource you want to create.

.Creating packages
[NOTE]
====
It is recommended to create your resources, such as Process definitions, Work Item definitions, Data Models, etc., inside a package of a Project to allow importing of resources and referencing their content.

To create a package, do the following:

. In the *Repository* view of the Project Explorer, navigate to the `REPOSITORY/PROJECT/src/main/resources/` directory.
. Go to *New Item* -> *Package*.
. In the *New resource* dialog, define the package name and check the location of the package in the repository.

====

[[_asset_metadata_and_versioning]]
== Asset Metadata and Versioning


Most assets within Business Central have some metadata and versioning information associated with them.
In this section, we will go through the metadata screens and version management for one such asset (a DRL asset). Similar steps can be used to view and edit metadata and versions for other assets.

[float]
=== Metadata Management


To open up the metadata screen for a DRL asset, click on the *Overview*
 tab.
If an asset does not have an *Overview*
 tab, it means that there is no metadata associated with that asset.


image::6593.png[]


The *Overview*
 section opens up in the *Version history*
 tab, and you can switch to the actual metadata by clicking on the *Metadata*
 tab.

The metadata section allows you to view or edit the ``Categories``, ``Subject``, ``Type``, `External Link` and `Source metadata` for that asset.
However, the most interesting metadata is the description of the asset that you can view/edit in the description field and the comments that you and other people with access to this asset can enter and view.

Comments can be entered in the text box provided in the comments section.
Once you have finished entering a comment, press enter for it to appear in the comments section.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must hit the *Save*
 button for all metadata changes to be persisted, including the comments.
====

[float]
=== Version Management


Every time you make a change in an asset and save it, a new version of the asset is created.
You can switch between different versions of an asset in one of two ways:

* Click the *Latest Version* button in the asset toolbar and select the version that you are interested in. Business Central will load this version of the asset.
+
image::6594.png[]
* Alternatively, open up the *Overview* section. The *Version history* section shows you all the available versions. *Select* the version that you want to restore.


In both cases, the *Save*
 button will change to *Restore*
.
Click this button to persist changes.

== Filtering Assets by Tag


It is possible to group assets of similar categories in the project explorer.
This feature helps you search through assets of a specific category quickly.
To enable this, the metadata management feature provides creating tags to filter assets by category.

.Procedure: Create tags and filter assets by tags
. Open the *Overview* tab of an asset and click the *Metadata* screen.
. In the *Tags* field, enter a name of your new tag and click *Add a new tag(s)* button. You can assign multiple tags to an asset at once by separating tag names by space.
+
.Creating Tags
image::Creating_Tags.png[Creating Tags in Matadata view]
+
The assigned tags are displayed as buttons next to the Tags field:
+
.Tags in Metadata View
image::Created_Tags.png[Tags created in Metadata View]
+
In order to delete any tag, click the respective tag button.
+
. Click *Save* button to save your metadata changes.
. Once you are done assigning tags to your assets, click the image:5461.png[] (Customize View) button in the Project Explorer and select the *Enable Tag filtering* option:
+

.Enable Tag Filtering
image::Enable_Tag_Filtering.png[Enable Tag Filtering in Customize View]

+
This displays a *Filter by Tag*
drop-down list in the Project Explorer.
+

.Filter by Tag
image::Filter_By_Tag.png[Enable Tag Filtering in Customize View]

+
You can sort your assets through this filter to display all service tasks that include the selected metadata tag.


== Asset Locking Support


The default locking mechanism for locking a BPM and BRMS asset while updating it in Business Central is pessimistic.
Whenever you open and modify an asset in Business Central, it automatically locks the asset for your exclusive use, in order to avoid conflicts in a multi-user setup.
The pessimistic lock is automatically released when your session ends or when you save or close the asset.

The pessimistic lock feature is provided in order to help prevent users from overwriting each other's changes.
However, there may be cases when you may want to edit a file locked by another user.
Business Central allows you to force unlock a locked asset.
To do this:

.Procedure: Unlocking assets
. Open the asset.
. Click on the *Overview* tab and open up the *Metadata* screen.
+
If the asset is already being edited by another user, the following will be displayed in the *Lock status*
field: *Locked by <user_name>*.
. To edit the asset locked by another user, click *Force unclock asset* button.
+
The following confirmation popup message is displayed:
+
`Are you sure you want to release the lock of this asset? This might cause <user_name> to lose unsaved changes!`
. Click *Yes* to confirm.
+
The asset goes back to unlocked state.


[[_sect_process_definition]]
== Process Definition


A Process definition is a BPMN 2.0-compliant file that serves as a container for a Process and its BPMN Diagram.
A Process definition itself defines the [property]``import`` entry, imported Processes, which can be used by the Process in the Process definition, and [property]``relationship`` entries.
We refer to a Process definition as a business process.

[[_creating_a_process]]
=== Creating a Process Definition


Make sure you have logged in to JBoss BPM Suite or you are in JBoss{nbsp}Developer{nbsp}Studio
 with the repository connected.


To create a Process, do the following:

. Open the Project Authoring perspective (*Authoring* -> *Project Authoring*).
. In *Project Explorer* (*Project Authoring* -> *Project Explorer*), navigate to the project where you want to create the Process definition (in the *Project* view, select the respective repository and project in the drop-down lists; in the *Repository* view, navigate to `REPOSITORY/PROJECT/src/main/resources/` directory).
+

.Creating packages
[NOTE]
====
It is recommended to create your resources, including your Process definitions, in a package of a Project to allow importing of resources and their referencing.
To create a package, do the following:

. In the *Repository* view of the Project Explorer, navigate to the `REPOSITORY/PROJECT/src/main/resources/` directory.
. Go to *New Item* -> *Package*.
. In the *New resource* dialog, define the package name and check the location of the package in the repository.

====
+
. From the perspective menu, go to *New Item* -> *Business Process*.
. In the *New Processes* dialog box, enter the Process name and click *OK*. Wait until the Process Editor with the Process diagram appears.
+


[[_importing_a_process_definition]]
=== Importing a Process Definition


To import an existing BPMN2 or JSON definition, do the following:

. In the *Project Explorer*, select a Project and the respective package to which you want to import the Process definition.
. Create a new Business Process to work in by going to *New Item* -> *Business Process*.
. In the Process Designer toolbar, click the *Import* image:5209.png[] icon in the editor toolbar and pick the format of the imported process definition. Note that you have to choose to overwrite the existing process definition in order to import.
. From the *Import* window, locate the Process file and click *Import*.
+

.Import Window
image::user-guide-5212.png[Import window for Business Process Editor displaying imports from BPMN2.]


Whenever a process definition is imported, the existing imported definition is overwritten.
Make sure you are not overwriting a process definition you have edited so as not to lose any changes.

A process can also be imported to the git repository in the filesystem by cloning the repository, adding the process files, and pushing the changes back to git.
In addition to alternative import methods, you can copy and paste a process or just open a file in the import dialog.

When importing processes, the Process Designer provides visual support for Process elements and therefore requires information on element positions on the canvas.
If the information is not provided in the imported Process, you need to add it manually.
