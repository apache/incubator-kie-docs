BAPL-1228 Form modeler support for class models from external dependencies

https://issues.jboss.org/browse/RHPAM-784 Pere Fernandez Perez added a comment - 20/May/19 5:51 AM
Karina Varela, as Tomas David says, it's not possible to create a form for a DO from a different project. This change adds the possibility to reuse forms between projects, so if the project that contains the DO has a form for it, you should be able to use that form on a SubForm field. However, in order to have processes 100% working, we allow generating forms for external DO's via the form generation engine on process designer.
