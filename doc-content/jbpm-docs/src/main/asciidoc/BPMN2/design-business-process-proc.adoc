= Creating a business process in {CENTRAL}

The process designer is the {PRODUCT} process modeler. The output of the modeler is a BPMN 2.0 process definition file. The definition is used as input for the {PRODUCT} {PROCESS_ENGINE}, which creates a process instance based on the definition.

The procedures in this section provide a general overview of how to create a simple business process.
