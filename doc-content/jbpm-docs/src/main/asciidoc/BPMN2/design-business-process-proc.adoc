= Designing a business process in {CENTRAL}

The process designer is the {PRODUCT} process modeler. The output of the modeler is a BPMN 2.0 process definition file. The definition is used as input for the {PRODUCT} process engine, which creates a process instance based on the definition. The procedures in this section provide a general overview of how to create a simple business process. For a more in-depth example, see {URL_GETTING_STARTED_PROCESSES}[_{GETTING_STARTED_PROCESSES}_] for details about creating a new `MortgageApprovalProcess` example business process.

.Prerequisites
* You have created, imported, or are using a sample project. For more information on creating projects, see {URL_MANAGING_PROJECTS}[_{MANAGING_PROJECTS}_].
* You have created the required users. User privileges and settings are controlled by the roles assigned to a user and the groups that a user belongs to. For more information on creating users, see the *Creating users* chapter of {URL_INSTALLING_ON_EAP}[_{INSTALLING_ON_EAP}_].
