= Creating a business process in {CENTRAL}

The process designer is the {PRODUCT} process modeler. The output of the modeler is a BPMN 2.0 process definition file. The definition is used as input for the {PRODUCT} {PROCESS_ENGINE}, which creates a process instance based on the definition.

The procedures in this section provide a general overview of how to create a simple business process.
ifdef::DM,PAM[]
For a more detailed business process example, see {URL_GETTING_STARTED}#assembly-getting-started-process-services[_{GETTING_STARTED_PROCESSES}_].
endif::[]

.Prerequisites
* You have created or imported a {PRODUCT} project.
ifdef::DM,PAM[]
For more information about creating projects, see {URL_DEPLOYING_AND_MANAGING_SERVICES}#assembly-managing-projects[_{MANAGING_PROJECTS}_].
endif::[]
* You have created the required users. User privileges and settings are controlled by the roles assigned to a user and the groups that a user belongs to.

endif::[]

.Procedure
. In {CENTRAL}, go to *Menu* -> *Design* -> *Projects*.
. Click the project name to open the project's asset list.
. Click *Add Asset -> Business Process*.
. In the *Create new Business Process* wizard, enter the following values:
* *Business Process*: New business process name
* *Package*: Package location for your new business process, for example `com.myspace.myProject`
. Click *Ok* to open the process designer.
. In the upper-right corner, click the *Properties* image:processes/diagram_properties.png[] icon and add your business process property information, such as process data and variables:
.. Scroll down and expand *Process Data*.
.. Click image:processes/btn_plus.png[] next to *Process Variables* and define the process variables that you want to use in your business process.

.General process properties
[cols="30%,70%", options="header"]
|===
|Label
|Description

| *Name*
| Enter the name of the process.

| *Documentation*
| Describes the process. The text in this field is included in the process documentation, if applicable.

| *ID*
| Enter an identifier for this process, such as `orderItems`.

| *Package*
| Enter the package location for this process in your {PRODUCT} project, such as `org.acme`.

| *ProcessType*
| Specify whether the process is public or private (or null, if not applicable).

| *Version*
| Enter the artifact version for the process.

| *Ad hoc*
| Select this option if this process is an ad hoc sub-process.

| *Process Instance Description*
| Enter a description of the purpose of the process.

| *Imports*
| Click to open the *Imports* window and add any data object classes required for your process.

| *Executable*
| Select this option to make the process executable part of your {PRODUCT} project.

| *SLA Due Date*
| Enter the service level agreement (SLA) expiration date.

| *Process Variables*
a| Add any process variables for the process. Process variables are visible within the specific process instance. Process variables are initialized at process creation and destroyed on process completion. Variable *Tags* provide greater control over variable behavior, for example whether the variable is `required` or `readonly`. For more information about variable tags, see xref:variables-con_{context}[].

| *Metadata Attributes*
| Add any custom metadata attribute name and value that you want to use for custom event listeners, such as a listener to implement some action when a metadata attribute is present.

| *Global Variables*
|  Add any global variables for the process. Global variables are visible to all process instances and assets in a project. Global variables are typically used by business rules and constraints, and are created dynamically by the rules or constraints.
|===

The *Metadata Attributes* entries are similar to *Process Variables* tags in that they enable new `metaData` extensions to BPMN diagrams. However, process variable tags modify the behavior of specific process variables, such as whether a certain variable is `required` or `readonly`, whereas metadata attributes are key-value definitions that modify the behavior of the overall process.

For example, the following custom metadata attribute `riskLevel` and value `low` in a BPMN process correspond to a custom event listener for starting the process:

.Example metadata attribute and value in the BPMN modeler
image::BPMN2/bpmn-metadata-attributes-custom.png[Image of custom metadata attribute and value]

.Example metadata attribute and value in the BPMN file
[source,xml]
----
<bpmn2:process id="approvals" name="approvals" isExecutable="true" processType="Public">
  <bpmn2:extensionElements>
    <tns:metaData name="riskLevel">
      <tns:metaValue><![CDATA[low]]></tns:metaValue>
    </tns:metaData>
  </bpmn2:extensionElements>

.Example event listener with metadata value
[source,java]
----
public class MyListener implements ProcessEventListener {
    ...
    @Override
    public void beforeProcessStarted(ProcessStartedEvent event) {
        Map < String, Object > metadata = event.getProcessInstance().getProcess().getMetaData();
        if (metadata.containsKey("low")) {
            // Implement some action for that metadata attribute
        }
    }
}

. In the process designer canvas, use the left toolbar to drag and drop BPMN components to define your business process logic, connections, events, tasks, or other elements.

[NOTE]
====
A task and event in {PRODUCT} expect one incoming and one outgoing flow. If you want to design a business process with multiple incoming and multiple outgoing flows, then consider redesigning the business process using gateways. Using gateways makes the logic apparent, which a sequence flow is executing. Therefore, gateways are considered as a best practice for multiple connections.

However, if it is a must to use multiple connections for a task or an event, then you must set the JVM (Java virtual machine) system property `jbpm.enable.multi.con` to `true`. When {CENTRAL} and {KIE_SERVER} run on different servers, then ensure that both of them contains the `jbpm.enable.multi.con` system property as enabled otherwise, the {PROCESS_ENGINE} throws an exception.

. After you add and define all components of the business process, click *Save* to save the completed business process.
