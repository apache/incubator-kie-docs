= Service Tasks: WS Task, Email Task, REST Task

Service task is a task that uses a service, such as a mail service, web service, or another service.

{PRODUCT} contains the following predefined service tasks:

* A Web Service task for invoking a web service from a BPMN2 process.
* An Email task for sending emails through a mail server.
* A Log task that calls the `SystemOutWorkItemHandler` class.
* A REST task for sending REST calls.

Note that since the tasks extend the service task, their attributes are implemented as `Data Input Set` assignments, and `Data Output Set` assignments, not as separate properties.

To use the service tasks in your process:

. In Business Central, click *Authoring* -> *Project Authoring*.
. In Project Explorer, locate the project and the respective process under *BUSINESS PROCESSES*.
. Open the process in Process Designer and click image:3898.png[] to expand the *Object Library*.
. Expand the *Service Tasks* section and drag and drop the selected service task to the required position on the canvas.

For more information about service tasks, see <<_ws_task>>, <<_email_task>>, and <<_rest_task>>.

If you require other task types, implement your task as instructed in <<_sect_domain_specific_tasks>>.

[[_ws_task]]
== WS Task

The Web Service task implements the `WebServiceWorkItemHandler` class. The Web Service task serves as a web service client with the web service response stored as `String`. To invoke a Web Service task from a BPMN process, the correct task type must be used.


=== Multiple Parameters

The Web Service task can be used to invoke a web service method with multiple parameters. To do so, the following changes must be made to the BPMN2 process definitions:

. In the Process Designer, click image:3897.png[] to open the *Properties* panel.
. Select the *Variable Definitions* property and create a process variable called `pVar` with the custom type `Object[]`.
. Click the *WS* task in the Process Designer and click image:3897.png[] to open the *Properties* panel.
. Click image:getting-started-guide-6563.png[] next to the *Assignments* property.
. Change the `Parameter` input variable from `String` to `Custom` and enter `Object[]`. Select `pVar` in the *Source* field. Click *Ok*.
. In the property panel of the *WS* task, enter the following in the *On Entry Actions* property:
+
[source,java]
----
Object[] params = {"firstParam", "secondParam"}; kcontext.setVariable("pVar", params);
----


=== Custom Objects

In addition to primitive object types, the WebService task can use custom objects, such as `Person` or `Employee`.

To use custom objects:

. Create a custom model object using either the Data Modeler in {CENTRAL}, or using an external tool, like Red Hat CodeReady Studio.
. Use this custom model class in one of the *WS* tasks.
. Generate WSDL for this web service.
. Use Red Hat CodeReady Studio to generate Java classes from the WSDL.
. Create a `.jar` file that includes the model class generated from the WSDL file. Add `kmodule.xml` under the `META-INF` of the `.jar`.
. Upload the `.jar` to the Artifact Repository. In Business Central, add it to the list of project's dependencies that includes the configured Web Service task. This Web Service task must have new classes generated, and cannot rely on the original ones.
. Modify the project configuration using the *Deployment descriptor* as follows:
+
[source]
----
<kmodule xmlns="http://jboss.org/kie/6.0.0/kmodule" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
  <kbase name="defaultKieBase" default="true" eventProcessingMode="stream" equalsBehavior="identity" packages="*">
    <ksession name="defaultKieSession" type="stateful" default="true" clockType="realtime">
      <workItemHandlers>
        <workItemHandler type="new org.jbpm.process.workitem.webservice.WebServiceWorkItemHandler(ksession, runtimeManager.getEnvironment().getClassLoader())" name="WebService"/>
      </workItemHandlers>
    </ksession>
  </kbase>
</kmodule>
----
+
The above configuration utilizes the `WebServiceWorkItemHandler`.

=== Web Service Task Example

This example demonstrates a process that obtains a weather forecast for given ZIP codes. The process looks as follows:

image::user-guide-ws-process.png[]

. In the first human task, the process asks for ZIP codes.
. Next, the result of the first human task is transformed into a collection that is used as an input for the service task with multiple instances.
. Based on the input collection, the process creates several service task instances for querying the weather forecast service.
. Once all the service task instances are completed, the result is logged to the console.
. Another human task then shows the weather forecast for the chosen ZIP codes.

After the process instance is started, the user is prompted to select the mode of the service task: synchronous or asynchronous. Note that the difference between the two can be noticeable depending on the particular service.


[float]
=== Input Attributes

Endpoint::
The endpoint location of the web service you want to invoke.

Parameter::
The object or array to be sent for the operation.

Mode::
Can be `SYNC`, `ASYNC`, or `ONEWAY`.

Interface::
The name of a service, for example `Weather`.

Namespace::
The namespace of the web service, such as `http://ws.cdyne.com/WeatherWS/`.

URL::
The web service URL, such as http://wsf.cdyne.com/WeatherWS/Weather.asmx?WSDL.

Operation::
The method name to call.

[float]
=== Output Attributes

Result::
An object with the result.

[[_email_task]]
== Email Task

The Email task sends an email based on the task properties.

[float]
=== Registering Email Task in Business Central

Email task is not registered by default in Business Central, and therefore must be registered by the user.

Follow the procedure below to configure Business Central to use Email service task.

. Design a BPMN2 process definition in the Process Designer of Business Central. Add the Email task to the workflow.
. Select the Email task and click image:3140.png[] to open the *Properties* panel.
. Open *Assignments* and fill in the `To`, `From`, `Subject`, and `Body` properties, and any other relevant input attributes.
+
image::user-guide-Emailtask2.png[]
+
Alternatively, values can be mapped to properties using Process Variable to Task Variable mapping assignments.
+
From the Process Designer, open the *Properties* panel and select the `Variable Definitions` property to map variables.


[float]
=== Registering EmailWorkItemHandler

`EmailWorkItemHandler` is the work item handler implementation of the Email Service task. The Email work item is included in the work item definition file by default, however `EmailWorkItemHandler` is not a part of the default `kie-deployment-descriptor.xml` file, and therefore must be explicitly registered by the user.

To register `EmailWorkItemHandler`:

. Open the Project Editor and click *Project Settings: Project General Settings -> Deployment descriptor*  from the menu.

. Scroll down to the Work Item handlers list and click *Add* to add the `EmailWorkItemHandler` to the list. For example:
+
[source,java]
----
new org.jbpm.process.workitem.email.EmailWorkItemHandler("localhost","25","me@localhost","password");
----
+
Alternatively, email server parameters can be supplied using a constructor in the `ProcessMain.java` file:
+
[source,java]
----
EmailWorkItemHandler emailWorkItemHandler = new EmailWorkItemHandler("localhost", "1125", "", "",true); ksession.getWorkItemManager().registerWorkItemHandler("Email", emailWorkItemHandler );
----

[float]
=== Configuring Deadline

You can configure the Deadline email feature in two ways:

. *Mail Session on Container Level*
+
With this method, the Deadline email feature uses `EmailSessionProducer` to look up the `mail/jbpmMailSession` using JNDI. The following example is for Red Hat JBoss EAP `standalone.xml`:
+
[source,xml]
----
<system-properties>
...
  <property name="org.kie.mail.session" value="java:jboss/mail/mail/jbpmMailSession"/>
...
</system-properties>
...
<subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:mail:1.2">
  <mail-session name="default" jndi-name="mail/jbpmMailSession" >
    <smtp-server outbound-socket-binding-ref="mail-smtp" tls="true">
      <login name="email@gmail.com" password="___"/>
    </smtp-server>
  </mail-session>
</subsystem>
...
<outbound-socket-binding name="mail-smtp">
  <remote-destination host="smtp.gmail.com" port="587"/>
</outbound-socket-binding>
----

. *Using email.properties*
+
If the `mail/jbpmMailSession` is not found, {PRODUCT} searches for `/email.properties` on the class path with content similar to the following:
+
[source]
----
mail.smtp.host=localhost
mail.smtp.port=25
mail.from=xxx@xxx.com
mail.replyto=xxx@xxx.com
----


[float]
=== Input Attributes
The following parameters are required by default:

To::
The email address of the email recipient. Separate multiple addresses by a semicolon (`;`).

From::
The email address of the sender of the email.

Subject::
The subject of the email.

Body::
The HTML body of the email.


The following parameters are optional, and can be configured by mapping values assigned to these properties using `Process Variable to Task Variable` mapping in *Assignments*:

Reply-To::
Sets the reply recipient address to the `From` address of the received message. Separate multiple addresses by a semicolon (`;`).

Cc::
The email address of the carbon copy recipient. Separate multiple addresses by a semicolon (`;`).

Bcc::
The email address of the blind carbon copy recipient. Separate multiple addresses by a semicolon (`;`).

Attachments::
The URL of the files you want to attach to the email. Multiple attachments can be added to the email using a comma (`,`) to separate each URL in the list.

Debug::
A boolean value related to the execution of the Email work item. For example:
+
[source,java]
----
"Success" = true
----

The Email task is completed immediately and cannot be aborted.

[[_rest_task]]
== REST Task

The REST task performs REST calls and outputs the response as an object.

`RestWorkItemHandler` is capable of interacting with the REST service, and supports both types of services:

* _Secured_: requires authentication.
* _Open_: does not require authentication.

Authentication methods currently supported are:

* `BASIC`
* `FORM_BASED`

Authentication information can be given on handler initialization and can be overridden using work item parameters. All other configuration options must be given in the work item parameters map:

[float]
=== Input Attributes

Url::
Target URL to be invoked. This attribute is mandatory.
+
It is often necessary to configure the URL attribute with an expression. This gives you the ability to change the URL dynamically throughout the runtime. For example:
+
[source]
----
http://DOMAIN:PORT/restService/getCars?brand=#{carBrand}

----
In this example, carBrand  is replaced by the value of the `carBrand` process variable during runtime.

Method::
The method of the request, such as GET, POST, or other. The default method is GET.

ContentType::
The data type if you are sending data. The supported data types are `application/json` and `application/xml`. This attribute is mandatory for POST and PUT requests. If you want to use this attribute, map it as a data input variable in the *Data I/O* dialogue of the task.

Content::
The data you want to send. This attribute is mandatory for POST and PUT requests. This is an optional parameter. If you want to use it, map it as a data input variable in the *Data I/O* dialogue of the task.

ConnectTimeout::
The connection timeout. The default value is 60000 milliseconds. You must provide the input value in milliseconds.

ReadTimeout::
The timeout on response. The default value is 60000 milliseconds. You must provide the input value in milliseconds.
+
Username::
The user name for authentication. This attribute overrides the handler initialization user name.
+
Password::
The password for authentication. This attribute overrides the handler initialization password.
+
User name and password for basic authentication can be passed at construction time using the following:
+
[source,java]
----
RESTWorkItemHandler(String username, String password);
----

AuthUrl::
The URL that is handling authentication when using the `AuthenticationType.FORM_BASED` authentication method.
+
Use the following constructor for `FORM_BASED` authentication:
+
[source,java]
----
public RESTWorkItemHandler(String username, String password, String authUrl, ClassLoader classLoader) {
  this();
  this.username = username;
  this.password = password;
  this.type = AuthenticationType.FORM_BASED;
  this.authUrl = authUrl;
  this.classLoader = classLoader;
}
----
+
The following is an example of how the constructor must be used in *Deployment descriptor*:
+
[source,java]
----
new org.jbpm.process.workitem.rest.RESTWorkItemHandler("username","password","http://mydomain.com/my-j-security-check-url",classLoader)
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
*AuthUrl* configuration requires the typical implementation for `FORM_BASED` authentication in Java EE servers, and therefore should point to the `j_security_check` URL. Similarly, inputs for user name and password must be bound to `j_username` and `j_password` when using `FORM_BASED` authentication, otherwise authentication may fail.

ResultClass::
This attribute determines the class to which the value from the `Result` attribute will be converted.  If not provided, the default value is `String`.

HandleResponseErrors::
An optional parameter that instructs the handler to throw errors in case of unsuccessful response codes. For information on how to handle response errors, see <<_handling_rest_response_error>>.


[float]
=== Output Attributes

Result::
The result returned by the REST service.

Status::
The variable contains a value from interval 200 to 300 if the REST request was successful, or an error response code if the request was unsuccessful. This variable is not mapped by default. If you want to use this variable, map it manually as an output variable of the REST task.

StatusMsg::
If the service returned an error response, this variable will contain the error response message. This variable is not mapped by default. If you want to use this variable, map it manually as an output variable of the REST task.

All output attributes are `String` by default.

[float]
[[_handling_rest_response_error]]
=== Handling REST Response Error

`HandleResponseErrors` can be handled in two ways:

. *In the Process Definition Workflow*

.. `Status`: When `RESTWorkItemHandler` produces a `Status` output variable that includes an HTTP response code. This can be mapped to a process variable and used in a XOR gateway to determine the service outcome.
+
image::user-guide-REST1.png[]
+
.. `StatusMsg`: The output variable `StatusMsg` includes additional messages sent by the server, and is filled only when the HTTP Code is not between 200 and 300.

+
. *Using a Boundary Event*
+
To enable this feature, set the REST work item input variable `HandleResponseErrors` to `true`.
+
[IMPORTANT]
The `HandleResponse` must have a valid boolean expression or be left empty, which is equivalent to `false`. Otherwise, the REST task will throw an exception.
+
When the REST work item input variable `HandleResponseErrors` is set to `true`, the `RESTWorkItemHandler` handler will, upon receiving an HTTP response code outside of the 200-300 interval, throw the following Java exception:
+

[source,java]
----
public RESTServiceException(int status, String response, String endpoint) {
  super("Unsuccessful response from REST server (status " + status +", endpoint " + endoint +", response " + response +"");
----
+
With the `HandleResponseErrors` option enabled, this error can be caught using a boundary event:
+
image::user-guide-REST2.png[]
+

The provided example includes:

* A `WorkItemHandlerRuntimeException` `restError` process variable.
* A `WorkItemHandlerRuntimeException` `BoundaryError` event-defined output variable that has been mapped to the `restError` process variable.
* A Script task that includes the following code:
+
[source,java]
----
org.jbpm.process.workitem.rest.RESTServiceException x = (org.jbpm.process.workitem.rest.RESTServiceException) restError.getCause().getCause();
----
This code allows `RestServiceException` to be extracted from `WorkItemHandlerRuntimeException`. Using `RestServiceException` provides access to the following methods:
* `getResponse`
* `getStatus`
* `getEndpoint`
+
The next line in the Script task is:
+
[source,java]
----
System.out.println("response:"+x.getResponse());
----
+
This provides the full error message as returned by the server.
