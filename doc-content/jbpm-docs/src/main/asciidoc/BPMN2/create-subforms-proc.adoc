= Creating subforms with simple and complex field types
Complex field types is a category of fields in a form. You can use the complex field types to model form properties that are Java objects.
Simple subform and Multiple subform are the two types of complex field types. A simple subform represents a single object and a multiple subform represents an object array inside a parent form. Once you add one of these fields into a form, you must configure the form with information on how it must display these objects during execution. For example, if your form has fields representing an object array, you can define a tabular display of these fields in the form. You cannot represent them as simple inputs such as text box, checkbox, text area, and date selector.

.Procedure: To create and insert a subform containing a single object inside a parent form:
. In Business Central, go to *Authoring* -> *Project Authoring*.
. On the perspective menu, select *New Item* -> *Form*.
+
A new form opens in the Form Modeler. You must now configure the new form with information of the object it must contain.
. Enter the values for the required fields in the *Form data origin* tab and click *Add data holder*.

. Click *Add fields by origin* tab and add the listed fields to the form.

. Click the Edit icon on the field in the form to open the *Properties* tab.
. In the *Properties* tab, configure the form by providing required values to the fields and click *Save* to save the subform.
. Open the parent form to configure the properties of the object.
. In the parent form, click the *Add fields by type* tab. Select the object on the form and configure it in the *Properties* tab.
. In the *Properties* tab, select *Simple subform* for the *Field type* property. Then select the newly created subform for the *Default form* field property.

. Click *Save* to save the parent form.
+
This inserts your subform containing a single Java object inside the parent form.


.Procedure: To insert a subform with multiple objects inside a parent form:
. In Business Central, go to *Authoring* -> *Project Authoring*.
. On the perspective menu, select *New Item* -> *Form*.
+
A new form opens in the Form Modeler.
You must now configure the new form with information on the object array it must contain.
. Enter the values for the required fields in the *Form data origin* tab and click *Add data holder*.
. Click *Add fields by origin* tab and add the listed fields to the form.
. Click the Edit icon on the field in the form to open the *Properties* tab.
. In the *Properties* tab, configure the form by providing required values to the fields. You can use the Formula Engine to automatically calculate field values.
. Click *Save* to save the subform.
. Open the parent form to configure the properties of each of the objects.
. In the parent form, click the *Add fields by type* tab. Select each object on the form one by one and configure them in the *Properties* tab.
. In the *Properties* tab, select *Multiple subform* for the *Field type* property. Then select the newly created subform for the *Default form* field property.
