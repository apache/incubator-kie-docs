= Designer marshalling backend

Starting in {PRODUCT} version 7.1, the marshalling component of the process designer is changed to a new and improved version. The marshalling component is responsible for saving and loading the BPMN diagram into the designer. The new save/load backend ships with all new components and features of the editor. If you find any issues, you can temporarily revert to the legacy marshalling backend by setting the `Dbpmn.marshaller.legacy=true` system property. The default value is `false`.

To enable the legacy marshaller, run {CENTRAL} with the `Dbpmn.marshaller.legacy` system property set to `true`. For example:

* On Linux or UNIX-based systems: `./standalone.sh -Dbpmn.marshaller.legacy=true`
* On Windows: `standalone.bat -Dbpmn.marshaller.legacy=true`
