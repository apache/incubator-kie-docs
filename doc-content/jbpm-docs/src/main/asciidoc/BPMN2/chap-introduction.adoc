= Introduction


Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite is an open source business process management suite that combines Business Process Management and Business Rules Management and enables business and IT users to create, manage, validate, and deploy Business Processes and Rules.

To accommodate Business Rules component, JBoss BPM Suite includes integrated Red Hat JBoss BRMS.

Red Hat JBoss BRMS and Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite use a centralized repository where all resources are stored.
This ensures consistency, transparency, and the ability to audit across the business.
Business users can modify business logic and business processes without requiring assistance from IT personnel.

Business Resource Planner
 is also included with this release.

== Use Case: ProcessÂ­-based solutions in the loan industry


This section describes a use case of deploying JBoss BPM Suite to automate business processes (such as loan approval process) at a retail bank.
This use case is a typical process-based specific deployment that might be the first step in a wider adoption of JBoss BPM Suite throughout an enterprise.
It leverages features of both business rules and processes of JBoss BPM Suite.

A retail bank offers several types of loan products each with varying terms and eligibility requirements.
Customers requiring a loan must file a loan application with the bank.
The bank then processes the application in several steps, such as verifying eligibility, determining terms, checking for fraudulent activity, and determining the most appropriate loan product.
Once approved, the bank creates and funds a loan account for the applicant, who can then access funds.
The bank must be sure to comply with all relevant banking regulations at each step of the process, and has to manage its loan portfolio to maximize profitability.
Policies are in place to aid in decision making at each step, and those policies are actively managed to optimize outcomes for the bank.

Business analysts at the bank model the loan application processes using the BPMN2 authoring tools (Process Designer) in JBoss BPM Suite.
Here is the process flow:

Business rules are developed with the rule authoring tools in JBoss BPM Suite to enforce policies and make decisions.
Rules are linked with the process models to enforce the correct policies at each process step.

The bank's IT organization deploys the JBoss BPM Suite so that the entire loan application process can be automated.

The entire loan process and rules can be modified at any time by the bank's business analysts.
The bank is able to maintain constant compliance with changing regulations, and is able to quickly introduce new loan products and improve loan policies in order to compete effectively and drive profitability.

== Components


Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite has the following components:

* _Business Central_, which is a web-based application (`business-central.war` and `dashbuilder.war` ) and provides tools for creating, editing, building, managing, and monitoring of business assets as well as a Task client
* _Artifact repository_ (Knowledge Store), which is the set of data the application operates over and is accessed by the Execution Server
* _Execution Server_, which provides the runtime environment for business assets


A more detailed description of components is available in the [ref]_Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite Administration and Configuration Guide_
.

[[_bpms_and_brms]]
== Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite and BRMS

Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite comes with integrated Red Hat JBoss BRMS, a rule engine and rule tooling, so you can define rules governing Processes or Tasks.
Based on a Business Rule Task call, the Process Engine calls the Rule Engine to evaluate the rule based on specific data from the Process instance.
If the defined rule condition is met, the action defined by the rule is taken (see <<_business_rule_task>> and the Red Hat JBoss BRMS documentation for further information).

[[_sect_business_central]]
== Business Central

Business Central
 is a web console that allows you to operate over individual components in a unified web-based environment: to create, manage, and edit your Processes, to run, manage, and monitor Process instances, generate reports, and manage the Tasks produced, as well as create new Tasks and notifications.

* Process management capabilities allow you to start new process instances, acquire the list of running process instances, inspect the state of a specific process instances, etc.
* User Task management capabilities allow you to work with User Tasks; claim User Tasks, complete Tasks through Task forms, etc.

Business Central
 integrates multiple tools:

* _Process Designer and other editors_ for modeling Processes and their resources (form item editor, work item editor, data model editor, etc.), as well as process model simulation tools (see <<_chap_process_designer>>).
* _Rules Modeler_ for designing Business Rules models and their resources (see the Red Hat JBoss BRMS documentation).
* _Task client_ for managing and creating User Tasks (see <<_sect_user_tasks>>).
* _Process Manager_ for managing process instances (see <<_sect_process_instances>>).
* _Dashboard Builder_, the BAM component, for monitoring and reporting (see <<_chap_red_hat_jboss_dashboard_builder>>).
* _Business Asset Manager_ for accessing the Knowledge Repository resources, building and deploying business assets (see <<_chap_project>>).
+
Artifact repository (Knowledge Store) is the set of data over which Business Central operates.
It provides a centralized store for your business knowledge, which can consist of multiple repositories with business assets and resources.
+
Apart from the project assets,  you can also manage your pom artifacts (such as parent `pom.xml` files for kjars) from Business Central's *Artifact repository*, in case you do not have a separate repository to manage your artifacts.
You can further create a child project to extend the uploaded pom artifact by adding the <parent>PARENT_GAV</parent> tag to `pom.xml`
of the given child project.
Here, [parameter]``PARENT_GAV`` denotes group, artifact and version of the previously uploaded pom artifact.


Business Central can be accessed from your web browser on `https://_$HOSTNAME_/business-central` (for instances running on localhost `https://localhost:8080/business-central`).

The tools are accessible from the _Views_ and _BPM_ menus on the main menu:

* *Process Definitions* displays the *Process Definition List* with the Process definitions available in the connected repository.
* *Process Instances* displays the *Process Instance List* with the Process instances currently running on the Process Engine.
* *Tasks* displays a view of the Tasks list for the currently logged-in user. You can call a Task List in the grid view or in the calendar view from the menu: *BPM* menu.

[[_embedding_business_central]]
=== Embedding Business Central


Business Central provides a set of editors to author assets in different formats.
A specialized editor is used according to the asset format.

Business Central provides the ability to embed it in your own (Web) Applications using standalone mode.
This allows you to edit rules, processes, decision tables, et cetera, in your own applications without switching to Business Central.

In order to embed Business Central in your application, you will need the Business Central application deployed and running in a web/application server and, from within your own web applications, an iframe with proper HTTP query parameters as described in the following table.
