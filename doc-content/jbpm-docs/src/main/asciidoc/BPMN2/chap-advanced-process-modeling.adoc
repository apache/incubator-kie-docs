== Process modeling options


You can create processes in multiple ways:

Using one of the graphical editors::
You can use two delivered graphical editors.
Process Designer is available through Business Central and Eclipse Process Designer.

Using an XML editor::
You can use any XML or text editor to create a process specification using the BPMN2 XML schema. See the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_bpm_suite/6.4/html-single/development_guide/#defining_processes_using_xml[Defining Processes Using XML] chapter of the _Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite Development Guide_ for further information.

Using the Process Fluent API::
You can use the {PRODUCT} API directly. The most important process model elements are defined in the following packages:
+
--
* [package]`org.jbpm.workflow.core`
* [package]`org.jbpm.workflow.core.node`
--
+
See the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_bpm_suite/6.4/html-single/development_guide/#sect_process_fluent_api[Process Fluent API] chapter of the _Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite Development Guide_ for further information.


[[_sect_workflow_patterns]]
== Workflow patterns


Workflow patterns are predefined blocks of process elements that enable you to reuse a predefined combination of process elements. Workflow patterns include multiple nodes that are connected and form a common executable pattern that can be reused in a process model.

Workflow patterns are available in the Workflow Patterns section of the Object Library and can be drag-and-dropped on the canvas just like any other elements.
To attach a pattern to an element on the canvas, select the element and drag-and-drop the pattern from the palette onto the canvas. The pattern automatically connects to the element.

Multiple predefined workflow patterns are provided by default and you can define your own workflow patters as necessary.
The definitions are defined as JSON objects in the `_EAP_HOME_/standalone/deployments/business-central.war/org.kie.workbench.KIEWebapp/defaults/patterns.json` file.

[[_defining_process_patterns]]
=== Defining workflow patterns


To define custom workflow patterns:

. In the *Workflow Patterns* section of the *Object Library*, locate a workflow pattern that will serve as a base for your workflow pattern.
. Open the `_EAP_HOME_/standalone/deployments/business-central.war/org.kie.workbench.KIEWebapp/defaults/patterns.json` file in a text editor.
. Locate the JSON object with the description property set to the base workflow pattern name (for example, ``"description" : "Sequence Pattern"``).
. Copy the JSON object and modify its elements as needed. Note that all the JSON objects are nested in a pair of square brackets and are comma separated.
