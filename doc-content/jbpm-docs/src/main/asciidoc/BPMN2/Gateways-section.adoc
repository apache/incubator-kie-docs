== Diverging gateway

Allows you to create branches in your process.
A Diverging Gateway should have one incoming connection and two or more outgoing connections.
There are three types of gateway nodes currently supported: 

* AND or parallel means that the control flow will continue in all outgoing connections simultaneously.
* XOR or exclusive means that exactly one of the outgoing connections will be chosen. The decision is made by evaluating the constraints that are linked to each of the outgoing connections. The constraint with the _lowest_ priority number that evaluates to true is selected. Constraints can be specified using different dialects. Note that you should always make sure that at least one  of the outgoing connections will evaluate to true at runtime (the engine will throw an exception at runtime if it cannot find at  least one outgoing connection).
* OR or inclusive means that all outgoing connections whose condition evaluates to true are selected. Conditions are similar to the exclusive gateway, except that no priorities are taken into account. Note that you should make sure that at least one of the outgoing connections will evaluate to true at runtime because the engine will throw an exception at runtime if it cannot determine an outgoing connection. 

It contains the following properties: 

* __Id__: The id of the node (which is unique within one node container).
* __Name__: The display name of the node.
* __Type__: The type of the split node, i.e., AND, XOR or OR (see above).
* __Constraints__: The constraints linked to each of the outgoing connections (in case of an exclusive or inclusive gateway).

== Converging gateway

Allows you to synchronize multiple branches.
A Converging Gateway should have two or more incoming connections and one outgoing connection.
There are three types of splits currently supported: 

* AND or parallel means that is will wait until _all_ incoming branches are completed before continuing. 
* XOR or exclusive means that it continues as soon as _one_ of its incoming branches has been completed. If it is triggered from more than one incoming connection, it will trigger the next node for each of those triggers.
* OR or inclusive means that it continues as soon as _all direct active paths_              of its incoming branches has been completed. This is complex merge behaviour that is described in BPMN2 specification but in most cases it means that OR join will wait for all active flows that started in OR split. Some advanced cases (including other gateways in between or repeatable timers) will be causing different "direct active path" calculation. 

It contains the following properties: 

* __Id__: The id of the node (which is unique within one node container).
* __Name__: The display name of the node.
* __Type__: The type of the Join node, i.e.
  AND, OR or XOR.
