= Adding fields to forms
You can add fields to a form by their origin or by selecting the type of the form field.
The *Add fields by origin* tab enables you to add fields to the form based on defined data origins.

The fields then have correct configuration of the `Input binding expression` and `Output binding expression` properties, so when the form is submitted, the values in the fields are stored in the corresponding data origin. The *Add fields by type* tab enables you to add fields to the form from the fields type palette of the Form Modeler. The fields do not store their value for any data origin until they have correct configuration of the `Input binding expression` and `Output binding expression` properties.

There are three kinds of field types you can use to model your form: simple types, complex types, and decorators. The `simple types` are used to represent simple properties like texts, numeric values, or dates. The following table presents a complete list of supported simple field types:

To use these field types, it is necessary to create extra forms in order to display and write values to the specified Java objects.
