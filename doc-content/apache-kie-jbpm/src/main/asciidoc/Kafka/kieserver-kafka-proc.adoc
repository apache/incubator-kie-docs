= Configuring {KIE_SERVER} to send and receive Kafka messages from the process

To run a process that sends or receives Kafka messages using events, you must use {KIE_SERVER}. You must configure the {KIE_SERVER} instance to integrate with {KAFKA_PRODUCT}.

.Prerequisites

* A {KIE_SERVER} instance is installed.

.Procedure

. To enable integration with {KAFKA_PRODUCT}, set the following system properties according to your environment:
** If you are using {KIE_SERVER} on {EAP}, set the `org.kie.kafka.server.ext.disabled` {KIE_SERVER} system property of to `false`.
** If you are using Spring Boot, set the `kieserver.kafka.enabled` system property to `true`.
+
. To configure the connection to the Kafka broker, set the `org.kie.server.jbpm-kafka.ext.bootstrap.servers` system property to the host and port of the broker. The default value is `localhost:9092`. You can use a comma-separated list of multiple host:port pairs.
. Optional: Set any of the following system properties related to both sending and receiving Kafka messages:

|Property
|Description

|`org.kie.server.jbpm-kafka.ext.client.id`
|An identifier string to pass to the broker when making requests. {KAFKA_PRODUCT} uses this string for logging.

|`org.kie.server.jbpm-kafka.ext.topics.*`
|Mapping of message names to topic names. For example, if you want to send or receive a message in the `ExampleTopic` topic when `ExampleName` is the name of the message, set the `org.kie.server.jbpm-kafka.ext.topics.ExampleName` system property to `ExampleTopic`. You can set any number of such system properties. If a message name is not mapped using a system property, the {PROCESS_ENGINE} uses this name as the topic name.

|`org.kie.server.jbpm-kafka.ext._property_name_`
|Set any {KAFKA_PRODUCT} consumer or producer property by using the `org.kie.server.jbpm-kafka.ext` prefix. For example, to set a value for the `buffer.memory` producer property, set the `org.kie.server.jbpm-kafka.ext.buffer.memory` {KIE_SERVER} system property.

This setting applies to all processes that send or receive Kafka messages using events on this {KIE_SERVER}.

|Property
|Description
|Default value

|`org.kie.server.jbpm-kafka.ext.acks`
|The number of acknowledgements that the Kafka leader must receive before marking the request as complete.
|`1`. This value means the leader writes the record to its local log and then responds to the {PROCESS_ENGINE}, without waiting for full acknowledgement from all followers.

|`org.kie.server.jbpm-kafka.ext.max.block.ms`
|The number of milliseconds for which the publish method blocks. After this time, the {PROCESS_ENGINE} can resume execution of the business process.
|`2000` (2 seconds).
