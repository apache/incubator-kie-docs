= BPMN2 task permission matrix in process designer

The user task permission matrix summarizes the actions that are allowed for specific user roles. The user roles are as follows:

* Potential owner: User who can claim the task, which was claimed earlier and is released and forwarded. The tasks with `Ready` status can be claimed, and the potential owner becomes the actual owner of the task.
* Actual owner: User who claims the task and progresses the task to completion or failure.
* Business administrator: Super user who can modify the status or progress with the task at any point of the task life cycle.

The following permission matrix represents the authorizations for all operations that modify a task.

* `+` indicates that the user role is allowed to do the specified operation.
* `-` indicates that the user role is not allowed to do the specified operation, or the operation does not match with the user's role.
