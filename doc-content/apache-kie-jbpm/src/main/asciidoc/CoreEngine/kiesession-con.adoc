After creating and loading the KIE base, you can create a KIE session to interact with the {PROCESS_ENGINE}. You can use this session to start and manage processes and to signal events.

The following code snippet creates a session based on the KIE base that you created previously and then starts a process instance, referencing the ID in the process definition.
