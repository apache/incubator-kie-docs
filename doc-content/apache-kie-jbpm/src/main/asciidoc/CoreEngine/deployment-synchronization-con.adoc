= Deployment synchronization

ifdef::DROOLS,JBPM,OP[]
Prior to jBPM 6.2, jBPM services did not have a deployment store by default.
When embedded in business-central/kie-wb, they utilized the `sistem.git` VFS repository to preserve deployed units across server restarts.
While that approach works, it causes some drawbacks:

* It is not available for custom systems that use services
* It requires a complex setup process in a cluster deployment, involving `zookeeper` and `helix`

Since version 6.2, jBPM services include a deployment synchronizer

{PROCESS_ENGINE_CAP} services include a deployment synchronizer

that stores available deployments into a database, including the deployment descriptor for every deployment.

The synchronizer also monitors this table to keep it in sync with other installations that might be using the same data source.
This functionality is especially important when running in a cluster or when {CENTRAL} and a custom application must operate on the same artifacts.

By default, when running core services, you must configure synchronization. For EJB and CDI extensions, synchronization is enabled automatically.

The following code sample configures synchronization:

.Configuring synchronization
[source,java]
----
TransactionalCommandService commandService = new TransactionalCommandService(emf);

DeploymentStore store = new DeploymentStore();
store.setCommandService(commandService);

DeploymentSynchronizer sync = new DeploymentSynchronizer();
sync.setDeploymentService(deploymentService);
sync.setDeploymentStore(store);

DeploymentSyncInvoker invoker = new DeploymentSyncInvoker(sync, 2L, 3L, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
invoker.start();
....
invoker.stop();
----

With this configuration, deployments are synchronized every three seconds with an initial delay of two seconds.
