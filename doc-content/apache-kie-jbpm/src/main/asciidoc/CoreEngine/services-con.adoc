= Services in the {PROCESS_ENGINE}

The {PROCESS_ENGINE} provides a set of high-level services, running on top of the runtime manager API.
ifdef::DROOLS,JBPM,OP[]
This API is available since jBPM version 6.2.
endif::DROOLS,JBPM,OP[]

The services provide the most convenient way to embed the {PROCESS_ENGINE} in your application. {KIE_SERVER} also uses these services internally.

When you use services, you do not need to implement your own handling of the runtime manager, runtime engines, sessions, and other {PROCESS_ENGINE} entities. However, you can access the underlying `RuntimeManager` objects through the services when necessary. 

[NOTE]
====
If you use the EJB remote client for the services API, the `RuntimeManager` objects are not available, because they would not operate correctly on the client side after serialization.
