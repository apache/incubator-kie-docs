= Typical usage scenario for the runtime manager

The typical usage scenario for the runtime manager consists of the following stages:

* At application startup time, complete the following stage:
** Build a `RuntimeManager` instance and keep it for the entire lifetime of the application, as it is thread-safe and can be accessed concurrently.

* At request time, complete the following stages:
** Get `RuntimeEngine` from the `RuntimeManager`, using the proper context instance as determined by the strategy that you configured for the `RuntimeManager` class.
** Get the `KieSession` and `TaskService` objects from the `RuntimeEngine`.
** Use the `KieSession` and `TaskService` objects for operations such as `startProcess` or `completeTask`.
** After completing processing, dispose `RuntimeEngine` using the `RuntimeManager.disposeRuntimeEngine` method.

* At application shutdown time, complete the following stage:
** Close the `RuntimeManager` instance.

[NOTE]
====
When `RuntimeEngine` is obtained from `RuntimeManager` within an active JTA transaction, you do not need to dispose `RuntimeEngine` at the end, as `RuntimeManager` automatically disposes the `RuntimeEngine` on transaction completion (regardless of the completion status: commit or rollback).
====

The following example shows how you can build a `RuntimeManager` instance and get a `RuntimeEngine` instance (that encapsulates `KieSession` and `TaskService` classes) from it:

.Building a `RuntimeManager` instance and then getting `RuntimeEngine` and `KieSession`
[source,java,subs="attributes+"]
----

    // First, configure the environment to be used by RuntimeManager
    RuntimeEnvironment environment = RuntimeEnvironmentBuilder.Factory.get()
    .newDefaultInMemoryBuilder()
    .addAsset(ResourceFactory.newClassPathResource("BPMN2-ScriptTask.bpmn2"), ResourceType.BPMN2)
    .get();

    // Next, create the RuntimeManager - in this case the singleton strategy is chosen
    RuntimeManager manager = RuntimeManagerFactory.Factory.get().newSingletonRuntimeManager(environment);

    // Then get RuntimeEngine from the runtime manager, using an empty context because singleton does not keep track
    // of runtime engine as there is only one
    RuntimeEngine runtime = manager.getRuntimeEngine(EmptyContext.get());

    // Get the KieSession from the RuntimeEngine - already initialized with all handlers, listeners, and other requirements
    // configured on the environment
    KieSession ksession = runtimeEngine.getKieSession();

    // Add invocations of the {PROCESS_ENGINE} here,
    // for example, ksession.startProcess(processId);

    // Finally, dispose the runtime engine
    manager.disposeRuntimeEngine(runtimeEngine);
----

This example provides the simplest, or minimal, way of using `RuntimeManager` and `RuntimeEngine` classes. It has the following characteristics:

* The `KieSession` instance is created in memory, using the `newDefaultInMemoryBuilder` builder.
* A single process, which is added as an asset, is available for execution.
* The `TaskService` class is configured and attached to the `KieSession` instance through the `LocalHTWorkItemHandler` interface to support user task capabilities within processes.
