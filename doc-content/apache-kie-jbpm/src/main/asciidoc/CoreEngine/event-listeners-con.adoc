= Event listeners in the {PROCESS_ENGINE}

Every time that a process or task changes to a different point in its lifecycle, the {PROCESS_ENGINE} generates an event. You can develop a class that receives and processes such events. This class is called an _event listener_.

The {PROCESS_ENGINE} passes an event object to this class. The object provides access to related information. For example, if the event is related to a process node, the object provides access to the process instance and the node instance.
