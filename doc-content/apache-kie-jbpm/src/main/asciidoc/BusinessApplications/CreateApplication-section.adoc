= Create your business application

Business application can be created in multiple ways, depending on the project types you need.
Select the project types that you want to include in your project.

=== Project types

Selection of project types to be included in the business application

* *Business Assets*: Contains business processes, rules, and forms and are easily imported into {CENTRAL}. Select Dynamic Assets instead if you want to add adaptive and dynamic assets such as cases.

* *Data Model*: Provides common data structures that are shared between the service projects and business assets projects. This enables proper encapsulation, promotes reuse, and reduces shortcuts. Each service project can expose its own public data model.

* *Service*: Includes business logic that operates your business.

Maven archetype commands can be used to generate the Business application.

Following are the commands to generate different types of projects. In these commands replace the business-application with the name of your project:

* Data model archetype

[source, bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
mvn archetype:generate -B -DarchetypeGroupId=org.kie -DarchetypeArtifactId=kie-model-archetype -DarchetypeVersion={COMMUNITY_VERSION_FINAL} -DgroupId=com.company -DartifactId=business-application-model -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT -Dpackage=com.company.model
----

This command creates a project which generates business-application-model-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

* Business assets project archetype

[source, bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
mvn archetype:generate -B -DarchetypeGroupId=org.kie -DarchetypeArtifactId=kie-kjar-archetype -DarchetypeVersion={COMMUNITY_VERSION_FINAL} -DgroupId=com.company -DartifactId=business-application-kjar -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT -Dpackage=com.company
----
This command creates a project which generates business-application-kjar-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

* Dynamic assets project archetype

[source, bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
mvn archetype:generate -B -DarchetypeGroupId=org.kie -DarchetypeArtifactId=kie-kjar-archetype -DarchetypeVersion={COMMUNITY_VERSION_FINAL} -DcaseProject=true -DgroupId=com.company -DartifactId=business-application-kjar -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT -Dpackage=com.company
----
This command creates a project which generates business-application-kjar-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

* Service project archetype with Business Automation capability

[source, bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
mvn archetype:generate -B -DarchetypeGroupId=org.kie -DarchetypeArtifactId=kie-service-spring-boot-archetype -DarchetypeVersion={COMMUNITY_VERSION_FINAL} -DgroupId=com.company -DartifactId=business-application-service -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT -Dpackage=com.company.service -DappType=bpm
----

This command creates a project which generates business-application-service-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

Lets review the different capabilities that you can choose to add for your business application service project.

=== Service Capabilities
Capabilities essentially define the features that your business application will be equipped with.
Available options are:

* Business automation(bpm) covers features for process management, case management, decision management and optimisation. These will be by default configured in the service project of your business application. Although you can turn them off via configuration.

[source, bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
mvn archetype:generate -B -DarchetypeGroupId=org.kie -DarchetypeArtifactId=kie-service-spring-boot-archetype -DarchetypeVersion={COMMUNITY_VERSION_FINAL} -DgroupId=com.company -DartifactId=business-application-service -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT -Dpackage=com.company.service -DappType=bpm
----

* Decision management(brm) covers mainly decision and rules related features (backed by Drools project)

[source, bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
mvn archetype:generate -B -DarchetypeGroupId=org.kie -DarchetypeArtifactId=kie-service-spring-boot-archetype -DarchetypeVersion={COMMUNITY_VERSION_FINAL} -DgroupId=com.company -DartifactId=business-application-service -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT -Dpackage=com.company.service -DappType=brm
----

* Business optimization(planner) covers planning problems and solutions related features (backed by OptaPlanner project)

[source, bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
mvn archetype:generate -B -DarchetypeGroupId=org.kie -DarchetypeArtifactId=kie-service-spring-boot-archetype -DarchetypeVersion={COMMUNITY_VERSION_FINAL} -DgroupId=com.company -DartifactId=business-application-service -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT -Dpackage=com.company.service -DappType=planner
----

It is recommended to generate all the three types Data Model, Business assets and Service (with BPM, BRM or PLANNER capability) projects from the archetypes in same directory.
