= Run your business application

Once your business application is created, the next step is to actually run it.

== Launch application

By default business application has a single runnable project - that is the service project. The service project is equipped with
two scripts (both for linux and windows)

* launch.sh/launch.bat
* launch-dev.sh/launch-dev.bat

the main difference between these two scripts is the target execution

* launch.sh/bat is dedicated to start application in standalone mode, without additional requirements.
* launch-dev.sh/bat is dedicated to start application in sort of development mode (in other words managed mode) so it will require {CENTRAL} to be available as {CONTROLLER}.

Development mode is meant to allow people to work on the business assets projects and dynamically deploy changes to the business application
without the need to restart it. At the same time it provides a complete monitoring environment over business automation capabilities (process instances,
  tasks, jobs, etc).

To launch your application just go into service project (_{your business application name}-service_)
and invoke

`./launch.sh clean install` for Linux/Unix

`./launch.bat clean install` for Windows

the `clean install` part of the command is to tell maven how to build. It will then
build projects in following order

* Data model
* Business assets
* Service

the first time it might take a while as it will download all dependencies of the project.
At the end of the build it will start the application and after few seconds you should
see output similar to following..,

[source, bash]

and you should be able to access your business application at http://localhost:8090/[http://localhost:8090/]

== Launch application in development mode

NOTE: Development mode requires {CENTRAL} to be available, by default at http://localhost:8080/business-central.
The easiest way to get that up and running is to use jBPM single distribution that can be downloaded at http://jbpm.org[jbpm.org]
Look at the Getting Started guide to get yourself familiar with {CENTRAL}.

Make sure you have {CENTRAL} up and running before launching your business
application in development mode.

== Import your business assets project into {CENTRAL}

Business assets projects that was just created can be easily imported into {CENTRAL}
as soon as it's a valid git repository. To make it as such

* Go into business assets project - _{your business application name}-kjar_
* Execute `git init`
* Execute `git add -A`
* Execute `git commit -m "Initial project structure"`
* Log in to {CENTRAL} and go to projects
* Select import project and enter the following URL `file:///{path to your business application}/{your business application name}-kjar`
* Click import and confirm project to be imported

=== Work on your business assets

Once the business assets project is imported into {CENTRAL} you can start working on it.
Just go to the project and add assets such as business process, rules, decision tables etc.

=== Launch business application in development mode

To launch your application just go into service project (_{your business application name}-service_)
and invoke

`./launch-dev.sh clean install` for Linux/Unix

`./launch-dev.bat clean install` for Windows

this should print the first entry after the build as follows

`Launching the application in development mode - requires connection to controller ({CENTRAL})`

and similar as to launching in the standalone more after couple of seconds
should be able to access your business application at http://localhost:8090/[http://localhost:8090/]

Once the application started, it should be successfully connect to {CONTROLLER} and by that
be visible in the servers perspective of {CENTRAL}.

=== Deploy business assets project into running business application

After adding assets to your project in {CENTRAL} you can just deploy it to a running server instance.
Click the `Deploy` button on your project and in few seconds you should see the
project deployed on your business application.

You can use Process Definitions and Process Instance perspectives of {CENTRAL}
to interact with your newly deployed business assets such as processes or user tasks.
