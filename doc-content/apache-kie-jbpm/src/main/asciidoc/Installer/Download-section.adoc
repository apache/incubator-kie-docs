= Downloading the Installer

First of all, you need to https://jbpm.org/download/download.html[download] the
installer and unzip it on your local file system. There are two versions

* full installer - already contains a lot of the dependencies that are necessary during the installation
* minimal installer - contains only the installer and will download all required dependencies on the fly

In general, it is probably best to download the full installer: jBPM-{revnumber}-installer-full.zip

You can also download the https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=public&g=org.jbpm&a=jbpm-installer&v=LATEST&e=zip[latest build] (only for the minimal installer).
