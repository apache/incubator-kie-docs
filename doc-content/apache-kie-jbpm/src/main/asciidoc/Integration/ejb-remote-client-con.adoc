= Remote EJB client

Remote client support is provided by implementation of the `ClientServiceFactory` interface that is a facade for application server specific code:

.Definition of the `ClientServiceFactory` interface
[source,java]
----
/**
 * Generic service factory used for remote lookups that are usually container specific.
 *
 */
public interface ClientServiceFactory {
	
	/**
	 * Returns unique name of given factory implementation
	 * @return
	 */
	String getName();

	/**
	 * Returns remote view of given service interface from selected application
	 * @param application application identifier on the container
	 * @param serviceInterface remote service interface to be found
	 * @return
	 * @throws NamingException
	 */
	<T> T getService(String application, Class<T> serviceInterface) throws NamingException;
}
----

You can dynamically register implementations using the `ServiceLoader` mechanism. By default, only one implementation is available in {EAP}. 

Each `ClientServiceFactory` implementation must provide a name. This name is  used to register it within the client registry. You can look up implementations by name.

The following code gets the default {EAP} remote client:

.Getting the default {EAP} remote client
[source,java]
----
// Retrieve a valid client service factory
ClientServiceFactory factory = ServiceFactoryProvider.getProvider("JBoss");

// Set the application variable to the module name
String application = "sample-war-ejb-app";

// Retrieve the required service from the factory
DeploymentServiceEJBRemote deploymentService = factory.getService(application, DeploymentServiceEJBRemote.class);
----

After retrieving a service you can use its methods.

When working with {EAP} and the remote client you can add the following Maven dependency to bring in all EJB client libraries:

[source,xml,subs="attributes+"]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.jboss.as</groupId>
  <artifactId>jboss-as-ejb-client-bom</artifactId>
  <version>{EAP_VERSION_LONG}.Final</version> <!-- use the valid version for the server you run on -->
  <optional>true</optional>
  <type>pom</type>
</dependency>
