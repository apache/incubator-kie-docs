|`jbpm.v5.id.strategy`
|This property is responsible for how the `id` value of `NodeInstance` instances was generated.
Setting this property to `true` meant that the same strategy used in jBPM 5 was still used, even though this (jBPM 5)
strategy meant that `NodeInstance` ids were _not_ unique.
|In jBPM 7, this is no longer possible: all `NodeInstance` id's are unique.
