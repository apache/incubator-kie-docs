[id='persistence-datamodel-ref_{context}']
= Binary runtime persistence data model

The runtime persistence data is internal. As a general rule, do not access the database tables directly and, most importantly, do not modify it. Changing the runtime state information for process instances without using the {PROCESS_ENGINE} might have unexpected consequences. Use a history log to analyze information about the current or past states of process instances.

In rare cases it might be useful to query internal database tables directly if you have a specific need to do so.

The {PROCESS_ENGINE} uses a binary persistence mechanism, otherwise known as marshalling, which converts the state of the process instance into a binary dataset. The same mechanism is also applied to the session state and any work item states.

When the process instance state is persisted, the {PROCESS_ENGINE} completes two steps:

* First, it transforms the process instance information into a binary blob. For performance reasons, the {PROCESS_ENGINE} uses a custom serialization mechanism and not standard Java serialization.
* Next, it stores the blob alongside metadata about this process instance. This metadata includes the process instance ID, process ID, and process start date, as well as other data.

Apart from process instance states, the {PROCESS_ENGINE} stores some state information for the session, including the state of timer jobs and the session data for evaluating business rules. The {PROCESS_ENGINE} stores the session state as a separate binary blob, along with metadata that includes the ID of the session. 

To restore the state of a session, reload the session with a particular ID using the `ksession.getId()` method.

Binary datasets that represent process instance states are usually relatively small, because they contain only the minimal execution state of the process instance. For a simple process instance, the state usually includes the nodes that are currently executing and any existing variable values.
