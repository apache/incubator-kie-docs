= Persistence and transactions in the {PROCESS_ENGINE}

The {PROCESS_ENGINE} implements persistence for process states. The implementation uses the JPA framework with an SQL database backend. It can also store audit log information in the database.

The {PROCESS_ENGINE} also enables transactional execution of processes using the JTA framework, relying on the persistence backend to support the transactions.
