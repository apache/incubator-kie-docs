Latest releases can be downloaded from https://jbpm.org/download/download.html[jBPM.org].
Just pick the artifact you want:

* *bin*: all the jBPM binaries (JARs) and their transitive dependencies
* *src*: the sources of the core components
* *docs*: the documentation
* *examples*: some jBPM examples, can be imported into Eclipse
* *installer*: the jBPM Installer, downloads and installs a demo setup of jBPM
* *installer-full*: full jBPM Installer, downloads and installs a demo setup of jBPM, already contains a number of dependencies prepackaged (so they don't need to be downloaded separately)

Older releases are archived at http://downloads.jboss.org/jbpm/release/.

Alternatively, you can also use one of the many Docker images available for use at the https://jbpm.org/download/download.html[Download] section.
