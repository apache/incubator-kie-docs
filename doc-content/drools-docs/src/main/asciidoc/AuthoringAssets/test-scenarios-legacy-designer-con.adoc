= Test scenarios (legacy) designer in {CENTRAL}

{PRODUCT} currently supports both the new *Test Scenarios* designer and the former *Test Scenarios (Legacy)* designer. The default designer is the new test scenarios designer, which supports testing of both rules and DMN models and provides an enhanced overall user experience with test scenarios. If required, you can continue to use the legacy test scenarios designer, which supports rule-based test scenarios only.
