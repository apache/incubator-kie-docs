= Feature comparison of legacy and new test scenario designer

{PRODUCT} supports both the new test scenario designer and the former test scenario (Legacy) designer.

The default designer is the new test scenario designer, which supports testing of both rules and DMN models, and provides an enhanced overall user experience with test scenarios. You can continue to use the legacy test scenario designer, which only supports rule-based test scenarios.

IMPORTANT: The new test scenario designer has an improved layout and feature set and continues to be developed. However, the legacy test scenario designer is deprecated with  {PRODUCT} 7.3.0 and will be removed in a future {PRODUCT} release.

The following table highlights the main features of legacy and new test scenario designer, which are supported in {PRODUCT} to help you decide a suitable test scenario designer in your project.

* `+` indicates that the feature is present in the test scenario designer.
* `-` indicates that the feature is not present in the test scenario designer.

a|*Creating and running a test scenario*

* You can create test scenarios in {CENTRAL} to test the functionality of business rule data before deployment.
* A basic test scenario must have at least a related data objects, *GIVEN* facts, and *EXPECT* results.
* You can run the tests to validate your business rules and data.

a|*Adding EXPECT results in test scenarios*

* The *EXPECT* section defines the expected results based on the *GIVEN* input facts.
* It represents the objects and their fields whose exact values are checked based on the provided information.

a|*Global variables*

* Global variables are named objects that are visible to the decision engine but are different from the objects for facts.
* Setting global variables for new test scenario is deprecated .
* In case you want to reuse data sets for different scenarios, you can use the *Background* instance.

a|*Call method*

* You can use this to invoke a method from another fact when the rule execution is initiated.
* You can invoke any Java class methods from the Java library or from a JAR that was imported for the project.
