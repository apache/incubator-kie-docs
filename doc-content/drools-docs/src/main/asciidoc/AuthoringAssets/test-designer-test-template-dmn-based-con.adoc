= Test template for DMN-based test scenarios

{CENTRAL} automatically generates the template for every DMN-based test scenario asset and it contains all the specified inputs and decisions of the related DMN model. For each input node in the DMN model, a *GIVEN* column is added, whereas each decision node is represented by an *EXPECT* column. You can modify the default template at any time as per your needs. Also, to test only a specific part of the whole DMN model, its possible to remove the generated columns as well as move decision nodes from the EXPECT to the GIVEN section.
