= Test Scenario designer layout

The designer introduces a tabular layout which helps you in defining a scenario template and all the associated test cases. The designer layout consists of a table which has a header and the individual rows. The header consists of three parts, the *GIVEN* and *EXPECT* row, a row with instances, and a row with corresponding fields. The header is also known as test scenario template and the individual rows are called test scenarios definitions.

The test scenario template or header has the following two parts:

* *GIVEN* data objects and their fields - represents the input information
* *EXPECT* data objects and their fields - represents the objects and their fields whose exact values are checked based on the given information and which also constitutes the expected result.

The test scenarios definitions represent the separate test cases of a template.

You can access the *Project Explorer* from the left panel of the designer whereas from the right panel you can access the *Test Tools* and the *Test Report*. You can use the *Test Tools* from the right panel to configure the data object mappings (*Test Editor*) or for accessing the cheat sheet (*Scenario Cheatsheet*) that contain notes which you can use as reference.
