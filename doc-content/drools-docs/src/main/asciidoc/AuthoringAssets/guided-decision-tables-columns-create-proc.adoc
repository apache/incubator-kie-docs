= Adding columns to guided decision tables

After you have created the guided decision table, you can define and add various types of columns within the guided decision tables designer.

.Prerequisites
* Any data objects that will be used for column parameters, such as Facts and Fields, have been created within the same package where the guided decision table is found, or have been imported from another package in *Data Objects* -> *New item* of the guided decision tables designer.

For descriptions of these column parameters, see the "Required column parameters" segments for each column type in xref:guided-decision-tables-columns-types-con[].

For details about creating data objects, see
