= "Add an Action BRL fragment"

A Business Rule Language (BRL) fragment is a section of a rule created using the guided rules designer. The xref:guided-decision-tables-columns-condition-BRL-con[condition BRL fragment] is the "WHEN" portion of the rule, and the action BRL fragment is the "THEN" portion of the rule. With this column option you can define an action BRL fragment to be used in the right ("THEN") side of a rule. Simpler column types can refer to Facts and Fact fields bound in the BRL fragment and vice-versa.

The following example is an action BRL fragment for a loan application:

You can also select *Add free form DRL* from the list of action options to define the action BRL fragment without the embedded guided rules designer.

.Template keys
[NOTE]
====
When you add a field for an action BRL fragment, one of the value options is *Template key* (as opposed to *Literal* or *Formula*). Template keys are placeholder variables that are interchanged with a specified value when the guided decision table is generated, and form separate columns in the table for each template key value specified. You can specify the default value of Template key in the *Value options* page. While Literal and Formula values are static in a decision table, Template key values can be modified as needed.

In the embedded guided rules designer, you can add a template key value to a field by selecting the *Template key* field option and entering the value in the editor in the format `$key`. For example, `$age` creates an `$age` column in the decision table.

In free form DRL, you can add a template key value to facts in the format `@{key}`. For example, `Person( age > @{age} )` creates an `$age` column in the decision table.

The data type is String for new columns added using template keys.
