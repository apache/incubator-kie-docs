= Defining enumerations for drop-down lists in rule assets

Enumeration definitions in {CENTRAL} determine the possible values of fields for conditions or actions in guided rules, guided rule templates, and guided decision tables. An enumeration definition contains a `fact.field` mapping to a list of supported values that are displayed as a drop-down list in the relevant field of a rule asset. When a user selects a field that is based on the same fact and field as the enumeration definition, the drop-down list of defined values is displayed.

You can define enumerations in {CENTRAL} or in the DRL source for your {PRODUCT} project.

.Procedure
. In {CENTRAL}, go to *Menu* -> *Design* -> *Projects* and click the project name.
. Click *Add Asset* -> *Enumeration*.
. Enter an informative *Enumeration* name and select the appropriate *Package*. The package that you specify must be the same package where the required data objects and relevant rule assets have been assigned or will be assigned.
. Click *Ok* to create the enumeration.
+
The new enumeration is now listed in the *Enumeration Definitions* panel of the *Project Explorer*.
. In the *Model* tab of the enumerations designer, click *Add enum* and define the following values for the enumeration:

* *Fact*: Specify an existing data object within the same package of your project with which you want to associate this enumeration. Open the *Data Objects* panel in the *Project Explorer* to view the available data objects, or create the relevant data object as a new asset if needed.
* *Field*: Specify an existing field identifier that you defined as part of the data object that you selected for the *Fact*. Open the *Data Objects* panel in the *Project Explorer* to select the relevant data object and view the list of available *Identifier* options. You can create the relevant identifier for the data object if needed.
* *Context*: Specify a list of values in the format `['string1','string2','string3']` or `[integer1,integer2,integer3]` that you want to map to the *Fact* and *Field* definitions. These values will be displayed as a drop-down list for the relevant field of the rule asset.

For example, the following enumeration defines the drop-down values for applicant credit rating in a loan application decision service:

.Example enumeration for applicant credit rating in the DRL source
[source]
----
'Applicant.creditRating' : ['AA', 'OK', 'Sub prime']
----

In this example, for any guided rule, guided rule template, or guided decision table that is in the same package of the project and that uses the `Applicant` data object and the `creditRating` field, the configured values are available as drop-down options:
