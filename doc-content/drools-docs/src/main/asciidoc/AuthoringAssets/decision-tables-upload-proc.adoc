= Uploading spreadsheet decision tables to {CENTRAL}

After you define your rules in an external XLS or XLSX spreadsheet of decision tables, you can upload the spreadsheet file to your project in {CENTRAL}.

IMPORTANT: You should typically upload only one spreadsheet of decision tables, containing all necessary `RuleTable` definitions, per rule package in {CENTRAL}. You can upload separate decision table spreadsheets for separate packages, but uploading multiple spreadsheets in the same package can cause compilation errors from conflicting `RuleSet` or `RuleTable` attributes and is therefore not recommended.

.Procedure
. In {CENTRAL}, go to *Menu* -> *Design* -> *Projects* and click the project name.
. Click *Add Asset* -> *Decision Table (Spreadsheet)*.
. Enter an informative *Decision Table* name and select the appropriate *Package*.
. Click the *Choose File* icon, and select the spreadsheet. Click *Ok* to upload.
. In the decision tables designer, click *Validate* in the upper-right toolbar to validate the table. If the table validation fails, open the XLS or XLSX file and address any syntax errors. For syntax help, see xref:decision-tables-defining-proc[].
