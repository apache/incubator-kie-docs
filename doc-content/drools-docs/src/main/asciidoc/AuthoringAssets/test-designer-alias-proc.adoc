= Using aliases in rule-based test scenarios

In the test scenarios designer, once you map a header cell with a data object, the data object is removed from the *Test Tools* tab. You can re-map a data object to another header cell by using an alias. Aliases enable you to specify multiple instances of the same data object in a test scenario. You can also create property aliases to rename the used properties directly in the table.

.Procedure
In the test scenarios designer in {CENTRAL}, double-click a header cell and manually change the name. Ensure that the aliases are uniquely named.

The instance now appears in the list of data objects in the *Test Tools* tab.
