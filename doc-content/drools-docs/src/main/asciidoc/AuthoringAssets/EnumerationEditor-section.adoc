= Data enumerations (drop down list configurations)


Data enumerations are an optional asset type that technical folk can configure to provide drop down lists for the guided editor.
These are stored and edited just like any other asset, and apply to the package that they belong to.

The contents of an enum config are a mapping of `Fact.field` to a list of values to be used in a drop down.
The strings are either a value to be shown in a drop down, or a mapping from the code value (what ends up used in the rule) and a display value.

If you wish to use a mapping between value used in the rule and the value shown in the UI you need to separate the code value and display value with an equals sign.
For example:
[source]
----
'Person.gender' : ['M=Male','F=Female']
----
In this example `F` will be used in the rules but `Female` shown in the UI.

Drop down lists can also depend on other field values.

Lets imagine a simple fact model, we have a class called Vehicle, which has 2 fields: `engineType` and ``fuelType``.
We want to have a choice for the `engineType` of "Petrol" or "Diesel". Now, obviously the choice type for fuel must be dependent on the engine type (so for Petrol we have ULP and PULP, and for Diesel we have BIO and NORMAL). We can express this dependency in an enumeration as:

This shows how it is possible to make the choices dependent on other field values.
Note that once you pick the engineType, the choice list for the fuelType will be determined.

[NOTE]
====
Choices are not dependent across rule conditions and actions. If the rule condition checks engine type then the guided editor will not offer dependent fuel types in the rule actions.

== Advanced enumeration concepts


There are a few other advanced things you can do with data enumerations.

[[_drools.advanceenumconcepts.external]]
=== External data-sources


Instead of defining a static list you can retrieve the list from an external data-source by using a helper class.

The helper class must be on the Project's classpath; by adding a JAR containng the class as a project dependency.
The helper class must be instantiable and have a non-static method that returns a ``java.util.List``.
Population of the list is implementation specific.

For example:
[source]
----
'Person.age' : (new org.yourco.DataHelper()).getListOfAges()
----

In some other cases you may want to load the enumeration data entirely from an external data source (such as a relational database). To do this, you can implement a class that returns a ``Map<String, List<String>>``.
The key of the map is the `Fact.field`  and the value is a `java.util.List<String>` of values to be used.

[source,java]
----
public class SampleDataSource2 {

  public Map<String>, List<String> loadData() {
    Map data = new HashMap();

    List d = new ArrayList();
    d.add("value1");
    d.add("value2");
    data.put("Fact.field", d);

    return data;
  }

}
----


The enumeration definition would simply be as follows (with no reference to fact or field names):

[source,java]
----
=(new SampleDataSource2()).loadData()
----


The `=` operator informs the workbench to load all enumeration data from the helper class.

[NOTE]
====
The helper methods will be statically evaluated when the enumeration definition is requested for use in an editor.
====

[[_drools.advanceenumconcepts.dynamic]]
=== Dynamic lookup


All of the above cases retrieve the list of values by statically evaluating the enumeration definition when enumerations are required by an editor.

It is also possible to load dependent enumeration definitions dynamically from a helper class by enclosing the call to the helper class within quotation marks.
For example:
[source]
----
'Country.region[countryCode]' : '(new org.yourco.DataHelper()).getListOfRegions("@{countryCode}")'
----
