= Creating and executing DRL rules in Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio

You can use Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio to create DRL files with rules and integrate the files with your {PRODUCT} decision service. This method of creating DRL rules is helpful if you already use Red Hat Developer Studio for your decision service and want to continue with the same work flow. If you do not already use this method, then the {CENTRAL} interface of {PRODUCT} is recommended for creating DRL files and other rule assets.

.Prerequisites
* Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio has been installed from the https://access.redhat.com/downloads/[Red Hat Customer Portal].

.Procedure
. In the Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio, click *File* -> *New* -> *Project*.
. In the *New Project* window that opens, select *Drools* -> *Drools Project* and click *Next*.
. Click the second icon to *Create a project and populate it with some example files to help you get started quickly*. Click *Next*.
. Enter a *Project name* and select the *Maven* radio button as the project building option. The GAV values are generated automatically. You can update these values as needed for your project:
* *Group ID:* `com.sample`
* *Artifact ID:* `my-project`
* *Version:* `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT`
. Click *Finish* to create the project.
+
This configuration sets up a basic project structure, class path, and sample rules. The following is an overview of the project structure:
+
[source]
----
my-project
 `-- src/main/java
    | `-- com.sample
    |    `-- DecisionTableTest.java
    |    `-- DroolsTest.java
    |    `-- ProcessTest.java
    |
 `-- src/main/resources
    | `-- dtables
    |    `-- Sample.xls
    | `-- process
    |    `-- sample.bpmn
    | `-- rules
    |    `-- Sample.drl
    | `-- META-INF
    |
 `-- JRE System Library
    |
 `-- Maven Dependencies
    |
 `-- Drools Library
    |
 `-- src
    |
 `-- target
    |
 `-- pom.xml
----

Notice the following elements:

* A `Sample.drl` rule file in the `src/main/resources` directory, containing an example `Hello World` and `GoodBye` rules.
* A `DroolsTest.java` file under the `src/main/java` directory in the `com.sample` package. The `DroolsTest` class can be used to execute the `Sample.drl` rule.
* The `Drools Library` directory, which acts as a custom class path containing JAR files necessary for execution.

You can edit the existing `Sample.drl` file and `DroolsTest.java` files with new configurations as needed, or create new rule and object files. In this procedure, you are creating a new rule and new Java objects.
--
. Create a Java object on which the rule or rules will operate.
+
In this example, a `Person.java` file is created in `my-project/src/main/java/com.sample`. The `Person` class contains getter and setter methods to set and retrieve the first name, last name, hourly rate, and the wage of a person:
+
[source,java]
----
  public class Person {
    private String firstName;
    private String lastName;
    private Integer hourlyRate;
    private Integer wage;

    public String getFirstName() {
      return firstName;
    }

    public void setFirstName(String firstName) {
      this.firstName = firstName;
    }

    public String getLastName() {
      return lastName;
    }

    public void setLastName(String lastName) {
      this.lastName = lastName;
    }

    public Integer getHourlyRate() {
      return hourlyRate;
    }

    public void setHourlyRate(Integer hourlyRate) {
      this.hourlyRate = hourlyRate;
    }

    public Integer getWage(){
      return wage;
    }

    public void setWage(Integer wage){
      this.wage = wage;
    }
  }
----
. Click *File* -> *Save* to save the file.
. Create a rule file in `.drl` format in `my-project/src/main/resources/rules`. The DRL file must contain at a minimum a package specification, an import list of data objects to be used by the rule or rules, and one or more rules with `when` conditions and `then` actions.
+
The following `Wage.drl` file contains a `Wage` rule that imports the `Person` class, calculates the wage and hourly rate values, and displays a message based on the result:
+
[source,java]
----
package com.sample;

import com.sample.Person;

dialect "java"

rule "Wage"
  when
    Person(hourlyRate * wage > 100)
    Person(name : firstName, surname : lastName)
  then
    System.out.println("Hello" + " " + name + " " + surname + "!");
    System.out.println("You are rich!");
end
----
. Click *File* -> *Save* to save the file.
. Create a main class and save it to the same directory as the Java object that you created. The main class will load the KIE base and execute rules.
+
NOTE: You can also add the `main()` method and `Person` class within a single Java object file, similar to the `DroolsTest.java` sample file.
+

. In the main class, add the required `import` statements to import KIE services, a KIE container, and a KIE session. Then load the KIE base, insert facts, and execute the rule from the `main()` method that passes the fact model to the rule.
+
In this example, a `RulesTest.java` file is created in `my-project/src/main/java/com.sample` with the required imports and `main()` method:
+
[source,java]
----
package com.sample;

import org.kie.api.KieServices;
import org.kie.api.runtime.KieContainer;
import org.kie.api.runtime.KieSession;

public class RulesTest {
  public static final void main(String[] args) {
    try {
      // Load the KIE base:
      KieServices ks = KieServices.Factory.get();
      KieContainer kContainer = ks.getKieClasspathContainer();
      KieSession kSession = kContainer.newKieSession();

      // Set up the fact model:
      Person p = new Person();
      p.setWage(12);
      p.setFirstName("Tom");
      p.setLastName("Summers");
      p.setHourlyRate(10);

      // Insert the person into the session:
      kSession.insert(p);

      // Fire all rules:
      kSession.fireAllRules();
      kSession.dispose();
    }

    catch (Throwable t) {
      t.printStackTrace();
    }
  }
}

. Click *File* -> *Save* to save the file.
. After you create and save all DRL assets in your project, right-click your project folder and select *Run As* -> *Java Application* to build the project. If the project build fails, address any problems described in the *Problems* tab of the lower window in Developer Studio, and try again to validate the project until the project builds.

.If the *Run As* -> *Java Application* option is not available
[NOTE]
====
If *Java Application* is not an option when you right-click your project and select *Run As*, then go to *Run As* -> *Run Configurations*, right-click *Java Application*, and click *New*. Then in the *Main* tab, browse for and select your *Project* and the associated *Main class*. Click *Apply* and then click *Run* to test the project. The next time you right-click your project folder, the *Java Application* option will appear.
====

To integrate the new rule assets with an existing project in {PRODUCT}, you can compile the new project as a knowledge JAR (KJAR) and add it as a dependency in the `pom.xml` file of the project in {CENTRAL}. To access the project `pom.xml` file in {CENTRAL}, you can select any existing asset in the project and then in the *Project Explorer* menu on the left side of the screen, click the *Customize View* gear icon and select *Repository View* -> *pom.xml*.
