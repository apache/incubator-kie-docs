[[_drools.testscenarioeditor]]
= Test Scenario


Test Scenarios are used to validate that rules and KIE base work as expected.
When the KIE base evolves, Test Scenarios guard against regression.

.Example Test Scenario
image::Workbench/AuthoringAssets/TestScenario.png[align="center"]


Given section lists the facts needed for the behaviour.
Expect section lists the expected changes and actions done by the behaviour.
Given facts are passed for the Test Scenario before execution.
During the rule execution, changes in the KIE base are recorded.
After the execution ends the recorded actions, existing facts in the KIE base and KIE base output is compared against the expectations.

.KIE session Selector

KIE session selector is used to select the session that the rules are ran against.
The KIE session needs to be stateful and use the pseudo clock when simulated time is used.
KIE sessions are defined in the Project Editor, in the KIE bases and Sessions section.
