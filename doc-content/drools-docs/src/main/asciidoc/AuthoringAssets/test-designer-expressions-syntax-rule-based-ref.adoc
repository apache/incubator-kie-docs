= Expression syntax in rule-based test scenarios

Rule-based test scenario supports the following built-in data types:

* String
* Boolean
* Integer
* Long
* Double
* Float
* Character
* Byte
* Short
* LocalDate

[NOTE]
====
For any other data types, use the MVEL expression with the prefix `#`.
====

Follow the BigDecimal example in the test scenario designer to use the `#` prefix to set the java expression:

* Enter `# java.math.BigDecimal.valueOf(10)` for the *GIVEN* column value.
* Enter `# actualValue.intValue() == 10` for the *EXPECT* column value.

You can refer to the actual value of the *EXPECT* column in the java expression to execute a condition.

The following rule-based test scenario definition expressions are supported by the test scenarios designer:

.Description of expressions syntax
[width="",cols="3,6"]
|===
|Operator | Description

|=
|Specifies equal to a value. This is default for all columns and is the only operator supported by the GIVEN column.

|=, =!, <>
|Specifies inequality of a value. This operator can be combined with other operators.

|<, >, \<=, >=
|Specifies a comparison: less than, greater than, less or equals than, and greater or equals than.

|#
|This operator is used to set the java expression value to a property header cell which can be executed as a java method.

|[value1, value2, value3]
|Specifies a list of values. If one or more values are valid, the scenario definition is evaluated as true.

|expression1; expression2; expression3
|Specifies a list of expressions. If all expressions are valid, the scenario definition is evaluated as true.

|===

[NOTE]
====
An empty cell is skipped from evaluation. To define an empty string, use `=`,`[]`, or `;`. To define a null value, use `null`.

.Example expressions
[width="",cols="2,9"]
|===
|Expression | Description

|-1
|The actual value is equal to -1.

|< 0
|The actual value is less than 0.

|! > 0
|The actual value is not greater than 0.

|[-1, 0, 1]
|The actual value is equal to either -1 or 0 or 1.

|<> [1, -1]
|The actual value is neither equal to 1 nor -1.

|! 100; 0
|The actual value is not equal to 100 but is equal to 0.

|!= < 0; <> > 1
|The actual value is neither less than 0 nor greater than 1.

|<> \<= 0; >= 1
|The actual value is neither less than 0 nor equal to 0 but is greater than or equal to 1.
