= Using list and map collections in test scenarios

The test scenarios designer supports list and map collections for both DMN-based as well as rules-based test scenarios. You can define a collection like a list or a map â€‹as the value of a particular cell in both *GIVEN* and *EXPECT* columns.

[NOTE]
====
For map entries, an entry key must be a `String` data type.

.Procedure
. Set the column type first (use a field whose type is a list or a map).
. Double click a cell in the column to input a value.
. In the collection editor popup, click *Add new item*.
. Enter the required value and click the check icon image:dmn/dmn-datatype-constraints-tickmark.png[] to save each collection item that you add.
. Click *Save*.

To delete an item from the collection, click the bin icon in the collection popup editor. Click *Remove* to delete the collection itself.
