= Background instance in test scenarios

In test scenario designer, you can use the *Background* tab to add and set background data for rules-based and DMN-based test scenarios. You can add and define the GIVEN data which is common for the entire test scenario simulation, based on the available data objects. *Background* tab has the ability to add and share the data among every test scenario. Data added using the *Background* tab can not be overridden by *Model* tab data.

For example, if the test scenario example requires the same value for the person `Age` in all test scenarios, you can define the `Age` value in the *Background* page and exclude that column from the test scenario table template. In this case, the `Age` is set to `25` for all test scenarios.

[NOTE]
====
The GIVEN data which is defined in the *Background* tab can only be shared between the test scenarios of the same **.scesim* file and will not be shared among different test scenarios.
