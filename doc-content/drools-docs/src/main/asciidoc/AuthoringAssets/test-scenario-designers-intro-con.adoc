= Using the Test Scenario designer in {CENTRAL}

{PRODUCT} ships with two designers for you to create and run test scenarios to validate your business rules and data. The difference between them is that by using the *Test Scenario* designer you can create and run both DMN-based test scenarios as well as rules-based test scenarios whereas by using the *Test Scenario (Legacy)* designer you can create and run only rules-based test scenarios. Both are supported by Red Hat for production use. The sections covered in this chapter will help you understand how to use the *Test Scenario* designer to create and run test scenarios.

[NOTE]
====
Currently, the *Test Scenario* designer can only use the default KIE session.
