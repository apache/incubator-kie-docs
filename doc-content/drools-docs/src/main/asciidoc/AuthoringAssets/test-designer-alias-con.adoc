= Concept of aliases (for rule-based scenarios only)

In the Test Scenario designer, once you map a header cell with a data object, the data object is removed from the *Test Editor* tab in the *Test Tools* panel. You can re-map a data object to another header cell by using the concept of *Alias*. Aliases enable you to specify multiple instances of the same data object. Ensure that the aliases are uniquely named. By doing so, the data object again becomes available in the *Test Editor* tab for remapping. To introduce an alias, double click on a corresponding header cell and manually change the name. You can create property aliases as well. This allows you to rename the used properties directly in the table.
