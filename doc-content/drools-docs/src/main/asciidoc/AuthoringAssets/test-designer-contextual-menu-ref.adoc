= Contextual menu options

The *Test Scenario* designer provides contextual menu options, which enables you to perform basic operations on the table such as adding, deleting, and, duplicating rows and columns. To use the contextual menus, you need to right-click a table element. Menu options differ based on the table element you select.

The `Insert column right` or `Insert column left` context menu options behave differently,

* if the selected column does not have a type defined, a new column without a type is added.
* if the selected column has a type defined, either a new empty column or a column with the parent instance type is created.
* if the action is performed from an instance header, a new column without a type is created.
* if the action is performed from a property header, a new column with the parent instance type is created.
