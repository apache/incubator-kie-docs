[[_drools.testscenarioprevieweditor]]
= Test Scenarios

The aim of the new _Test Scenarios_ editor is to help the user test the proper function of created rules and knowledge bases.
Compared with the current Test Scenarios (Legacy) editor, the new version is significantly enhanced by an improved user experience that introduces a tabular layout, which guides the user during the definition of a scenario template and all the assorted test cases. More than that new Test Scenario supports DMN model testing.
Running the defined scenarios verifies that the system works as expected and does not contain any regressions after a change.

.Example Test Scenario

The editor's layout consists of a table, which contains a header and the individual rows.
The header (test scenario template) is divided into two parts; the *given* data object fields, which represent the input information, and the *expected* data object fields, whose values are checked based on the given information and which constitute the expected result.
The rows (test scenario definitions) represent the separate test cases.

An integral part of the editor is the right panel, which can be used for configuring the data object mappings, for accessing the cheat sheet that contains a set of notes used for quick reference, and for displaying the tests results in the *Test Report* tab.

WARNING: Currently, the editor can only use the default KIE session.

NOTE: Some features are available only for RULE testing and some other for DMN. Each paragraph that cover one of these features contains _(RULE/DMN only scenario)_ in the title.

== Creating a Test Scenario
To create a test scenario asset, make sure the Test Scenarios editor is enabled.
Click *Add Asset* in the project Library a select *Test Scenario*.
Enter a name of the test scenario, select a package and then specify *RULE* or *DMN* testing. DMN file need to be specified in case of DMN.
After you click *Ok*, the editor opens.
All test scenarios are files with the `.scesim` file name extension.

=== Loading and Importing Data Objects (RULE scenario only)

All data objects that are located in the same package as a test scenario are automatically loaded and displayed in the right *Test Tools* panel in the *Test Editor* tab.
To update the list of data objects in the panel in case the data objects change (for example when a new data object is created or a data object is deleted), the test scenario must be closed and reopened.
After you click the name of the data object in the list, its fields and their types are displayed.

NOTE: To be able to click the name of the data object and display its fields, a column from the table must be selected first.
To select a column, click any of the column's headers.
This enables you to define the column's type.
See section <<_drools.testscenariopreviewtemplate>> for more information.

.Test Tools panel

In the panel, it is possible to search the data objects using the *Search* text box. To search data object, start typing the name (or any part of the name) and press *Enter* or click the search button.

To load a data object that is located in a different package than the opened test scenario, the data object must be imported first.
To import a data object, select the *Data Objects* tab directly in the editor, click *New item* and in the *Add Import* dialog window, choose the data object from the drop-down list and click *Ok*.
After you save, close, and reopen the test scenario, the added data object from a different package will be displayed in the list of all available data objects.

=== Basic Interaction Using the Contextual Menu

The contextual menu enables the user to perform basic operations on the table such as adding, deleting, and duplicating rows and columns.
To perform such interaction with the table, right-click on a corresponding table section.

[[_drools.testscenariopreviewtemplate]]
== Test Scenario Template

The header of the test scenario table defines the template for every scenario.
Two types of headers are used; *instance* headers and *property* headers.
Instance headers are mapped to a particular data object (a fact), whereas the property headers are mapped to a particular field of the corresponding data object.

To create a valid test scenario template, follow the procedure below.

.Creating a test scenario template
. Make sure all the required facts (data objects) are defined and available in the project.
. Create a test scenario asset and import the required data objects if needed.
. Use the contextual menus to add all the necessary columns or to remove the unnecessary ones.
You might need to invoke the contextual menus multiple times during the creation of the scenario template.
. Click on a column's header to select a particular column and to enable the available data objects in the *Test Editor* tab.
. In the *Test Editor* tab, select a data object or its field and click *Add*.
Make sure you set the type of both the instance and the property header.
. Define the type of each column in the test scenario table.

.Example test scenario template

=== Automatic template creation (DMN scenario only)

Every DMN scenarios are created with already a predefined template that contains all the available input and decision of the related DMN model. For each input node a GIVEN column is generated while each decision node becomes an EXPECT column.

This is just a default template but it is possible to remove columns and also to move a decision node from EXPECT section to GIVEN to test only a part of the whole DMN model.

=== Using Aliases (RULE scenario only)

To define multiple instances of one data object, you need to introduce an alias.
To introduce an alias, click on a corresponding header cell and manually change the name.

Once the alias is created, a new instance is added to the list of data objects in the *Test Editor* tab.
This instance can then be used in the same way as the predefined facts.

.Two created instances of a data object

It is possible to introduce property aliases as well; this allows the user to rename the used properties directly in the table to enhance the user experience.

[[_drools.testscenariopreviewscenario]]
== Test Scenario Definition

The rows of the test scenario table define the individual test scenarios.
A test scenario has a unique index, description, set of input values (the *given* values), and a set of output values (the *expected* values).

To create test scenario definitions, follow the procedure below.

.Creating test scenario definitions
. Make sure the test scenario template is already correctly defined.
. Use the contextual menus to add and remove individual test scenarios (rows in the table) as required.
. Write a description of a test scenario definition and fill in values into each cell of the row. Double click a cell to start the inline editing.
. Fill in the required values into each row of the test scenario table.

.Example test scenario definitions

=== List and Map support

To use List and Map fields just bind a column to one of them and then fill the values using the collection editor popup that appear after double click.

=== Expressions Syntax

Rule scenarios and DMN scenarios support different expression languages. A basic expression language is supported for RULE scenarios and FEEL for DMN scenarios.

==== Expression Syntax for RULE

The supported syntax of the test scenario definition expressions is as follows:

.Description of Expressions Syntax
[cols="1,2"]
|===
| Operator | Description

.^| `=`
.^| Specifies equality of a value. *This is the default operator of each column and the only operator that is supported for each given column.*

.^| `!`, `=!`, `<>`
.^| Specifies inequality of a value. This operator can be combined with other operators.

.^| `<`, `>`, `\<=`, `>=`
.^| Specifies a comparison: less than, greater than, less or equals than, and greater or equals than.

.^| `[value1, value2, value3]`
.^| Specifies a list of values. If *one or more* values are valid, the scenario definition is evaluated as true.

.^| `expression1; expression2; expression3`
.^| Specifies a list of expressions. If *all* expressions are valid, the scenario definition is evaluated as true.
|===

NOTE: An empty cell means skip it. To specify a null value use `null`.

.Example Expressions
[cols="1,2"]
|===
| Expression | Meaning

.^| `-1`
.^| The actual value equals to -1.

.^| `< 0`
.^| The actual value is less than 0.

.^| `! > 0`
.^| The actual value is not greater than 0.

.^| `[-1, 0, 1]`
.^| The actual value equals either to -1, 0, or 1.

.^| `<> [1,-1]`
.^| The actual value is not equal to 1 or -1.

.^| `! 100; 0`
.^| The actual value is not equal to 100, but equals to 0.

.^| `!= < 0; <> > 1`
.^| The actual value is not less than 0 and is not greater than 1.

.^| `<> \<= 0; >= 1`
.^| The actual value is not less than 0 or equal to 0, but is equal to 1 or greater than 1.
|===

A quick overview of the supported commands and syntax is also available in the *Scenario Cheatsheet* tab on the right side of the editor.

==== Expression Syntax for DMN

The language supported for DMN is FEEL.

A quick overview of the supported commands and syntax is also available in the *Scenario Cheatsheet* tab on the right side of the editor.

== Running a Test Scenario

=== Running a Test Scenario in Business Central

Click *Run Test* at the top of the Test Scenarios editor.
The *Test Report* tab automatically opens on the right with the test results; a red cross indicates test failures whereas a green check mark indicates that all tests were successful.

In the panel, information regarding the overall test status, time of completion, number of run scenarios, and duration is displayed.

To view a table with detailed failures stack traces, click *View Alerts*.
The *Alerts* panel at the bottom of the editor opens.
