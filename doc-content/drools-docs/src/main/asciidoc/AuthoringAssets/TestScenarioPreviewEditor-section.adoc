= Test Scenarios

The aim of the new _Test Scenarios_ editor is to help the user test the proper function of created rules and knowledge bases.
Compared with the current Test Scenarios (Legacy) editor, the new version is significantly enhanced by an improved user experience that introduces a tabular layout, which guides the user during the definition of a scenario template and all the assorted test cases.
Running the defined scenarios verifies that the system works as expected and does not contain any regressions after a change.
A considerable improvement is the full support of DMN model testing.

.Test Scenarios editor

The editor's layout consists of a table, which contains a header and individual rows.
The header (test scenario template) is divided into two parts; the *given* data object fields, which represent the input information, and the *expected* data object fields, whose values are checked based on the given information and which constitute the expected result.
The rows (test scenario definitions) represent the separate test cases.

An integral part of the editor is the right panel, which can be used for configuring the data object mappings, for accessing the cheat sheet that contains a set of notes used for quick reference, and for displaying the tests results in the *Test Report* tab.

WARNING: Currently, the editor can only use the default KIE session.

NOTE: Some features described below are available only for rule-based test scenario assets, whereas others only for DMN-based scenarios.
If applicable, the difference is indicated in the title of a corresponding part of the document.

== Creating a Test Scenario

Follow the procedure below to create a test scenario.

.Creating a test scenario asset
. Select a project where you want to create the asset.
. Click *Add Asset* in the project's list of assets a select *Test Scenario*.
. Enter a name of the test scenario and select a package.
. Specify the source type; a test scenario can either be rule-based or DMN-based.
If the source type is a DMN file, make sure the file is available in the project and select the file from the *Choose DMN asset* picker.
. Click *Ok* to create the asset and open the editor.

All test scenarios are files with the `.scesim` file name extension.

=== Loading and Importing Data Objects (rule-based scenarios)

All data objects that are located in the same package as a test scenario are automatically loaded and displayed in the right *Test Tools* panel in the *Test Editor* tab.
To update the list of data objects in the panel in case the data objects change (for example when a new data object is created or a data object is deleted), the test scenario must be closed and reopened.
After you click the name of the data object in the list, its fields and their types are displayed.

NOTE: To be able to click the name of the data object and display its fields, a column from the table must be selected first.
To select a column, click any of the column's headers.
This enables you to define the column's type.
See section <<_drools.testscenariopreviewtemplate>> for more information.

.Test Tools panel
image::Workbench/AuthoringAssets/sc2.png[align="center"]

In the panel, it is possible to search the data objects using the *Search* text box. To search data object, start typing the name (or any part of the name) and press *Enter* or click the search button.

To load a data object that is located in a different package than the opened test scenario, the data object must be imported first.
To import a data object, select the *Data Objects* tab directly in the editor, click *New item* and in the *Add Import* dialog window, choose the data object from the drop-down list and click *Ok*.
After you save, close, and reopen the test scenario, the added data object from a different package will be displayed in the list of all available data objects.

=== Basic Interaction Using the Contextual Menu

The contextual menu enables the user to perform basic operations on the table such as adding, deleting, and duplicating rows and columns.
To perform such interaction with the table, right-click on a corresponding table section.

If the selected column does not have a type defined, a completely new column without a type is added.
If the selected column already has a type defined, either a new empty column or a column with the parent instance type is created.
If the action is performed from an instance header, a completely new column without a type is created.
If the action is performed from a property header, a new column with the parent instance type is created.

.^| _insert column right_
.^| Inserts a new column to the right of the selected column.
If the selected column does not have a type defined, a completely new column without a type is added.
If the selected column already has a type defined, either a new empty column or a column with the parent instance type is created.
If the action is performed from an instance header, a completely new column without a type is created.
If the action is performed from a property header, a new column with the parent instance type is created.

.^| _delete column_
.^| Deletes the selected column.

.^| _insert row above_
.^| Inserts a new row above the selected row.

.^| _insert row below_

[[_drools.testscenariopreviewtemplate]]
== Test Scenario Template

The header of the test scenario table defines the template for every scenario.
Two types of headers are used; *instance* headers and *property* headers.
Instance headers are mapped to a particular data object (a fact), whereas the property headers are mapped to a particular field of the corresponding data object.

To create a valid test scenario template, follow the procedure below.
In case of a DMN-based scenario, skip to the following section first.

.Creating a test scenario template
. Make sure all the required facts (data objects) are defined and available in the project.
. Create a test scenario asset and import the required data objects if needed.
. Use the contextual menus to add all the necessary columns or to remove the unnecessary ones.
You might need to invoke the contextual menus multiple times during the creation of the scenario template.
. Click on a column's header to select a particular column and to enable the available data objects in the *Test Editor* tab.
. In the *Test Editor* tab, select a data object or its field and click *Add*.
Make sure you set the type of both the instance and the property header.
. Define the type of each column in the test scenario table.

.Example test scenario template
image::Workbench/AuthoringAssets/sc5.png[align="center"]

=== Automatic Template Creation (DMN-based scenarios)

Each DMN-based test scenario asset is created with automatically generated template that contains all the specified inputs and decisions of the related DMN model.
For each input node in the DMN model, a GIVEN column is added, whereas each decision node from the model is represented as an EXPECT column.

If needed, the default template can be modified at any time.
To test only a specific part of the whole DMN model, it is possible to remove the generated columns as well as move decision nodes from the EXPECT to the GIVEN section.

WARNING: Decision service outputs are *not* represented in the test scenario table.

=== Using Aliases (rule-based scenarios)

To define multiple instances of one data object, you need to introduce an alias.
To introduce an alias, double click on a corresponding header cell and manually change the name.

Once the alias is created, a new instance is added to the list of data objects in the *Test Editor* tab.
This instance can then be used in the same way as the predefined facts.

.Two created instances of a data object
image::Workbench/AuthoringAssets/sc8.png[align="center"]

It is possible to introduce property aliases as well; this allows the user to rename the used properties directly in the table to enhance the user experience.

[[_drools.testscenariopreviewscenario]]
== Test Scenario Definition

The rows of the test scenario table define the individual test scenarios.
A test scenario has a unique index, description, set of input values (the *given* values), and a set of output values (the *expected* values).

To create test scenario definitions, follow the procedure below.

.Creating test scenario definitions
. Make sure the test scenario template is already correctly defined.
. Use the contextual menus to add and remove individual test scenarios (rows in the table) as required.
. Write a description of a test scenario definition and fill in values into each cell of the row. Double click a cell to start the inline editing. To skip a particular cell from the evaluation, leave it empty.
. Fill in the required values into each row of the test scenario table.

.Example test scenario definitions
image::Workbench/AuthoringAssets/sc6.png[align="center"]

=== Expressions Syntax

Both rule-based and DMN-based test scenarios support different expression languages.
While rule-based test scenarios support a basic expression language, DMN-based test scenarios support the FEEL expression language.

==== Expression Syntax in Rule-Based Scenarios

The supported syntax of the test scenario definition expressions is as follows:

.Description of Expressions Syntax
[cols="1,2"]
|===
| Operator | Description

.^| `=`
.^| Specifies equality of a value. *This is the default operator of each column and the only operator that is supported for each GIVEN column.*

.^| `!`, `=!`, `<>`
.^| Specifies inequality of a value. This operator can be combined with other operators.

.^| `<`, `>`, `\<=`, `>=`
.^| Specifies a comparison: less than, greater than, less or equals than, and greater or equals than.

.^| `[value1, value2, value3]`
.^| Specifies a list of values. If *one or more* values are valid, the scenario definition is evaluated as true.

.^| `expression1; expression2; expression3`
.^| Specifies a list of expressions. If *all* expressions are valid, the scenario definition is evaluated as true.
|===

NOTE: To define an empty string, use `=`, `[]`, or `;`.
To define a null value, use `null`.
An empty cell is skipped from the evaluation.

.Example Expressions
[cols="1,2"]
|===
| Expression | Meaning

.^| `-1`
.^| The actual value equals to -1.

.^| `< 0`
.^| The actual value is less than 0.

.^| `! > 0`
.^| The actual value is not greater than 0.

.^| `[-1, 0, 1]`
.^| The actual value equals either to -1, 0, or 1.

.^| `<> [1,-1]`
.^| The actual value is not equal to 1 or -1.

.^| `! 100; 0`
.^| The actual value is not equal to 100, but equals to 0.

.^| `!= < 0; <> > 1`
.^| The actual value is not less than 0 and is not greater than 1.

.^| `<> \<= 0; >= 1`
.^| The actual value is not less than 0 or equal to 0, but is equal to 1 or greater than 1.
|===

A quick overview of the supported commands and syntax is also available in the *Scenario Cheatsheet* tab on the right side of the editor.

==== Expression Syntax in DMN-Based Scenarios

DMN-based scenarios use the FEEL expression language.

Supported data types are:

- _numbers_ and _strings_ (strings must be delimited by quotation marks), for example `"John Doe"` or `""`;
- _boolean values_ (`true`, `false`, and `null`);
- _dates_ and _time_, for example `date("2019-05-13")` or `time("14:10:00+02:00")`;
- _functions_;
- _contexts_, for example `{x : 5, y : 3}`;
- _ranges_ and _lists_, for example `[1 .. 10]` or `[2, 3, 4, 5]`.

A quick overview of the supported syntax is also available in the *Scenario Cheatsheet* tab of the *Test Tools* panel on the right side of the editor.

=== Lists and Maps

It is possible to define a collection--a list or a map--as a value of a particular cell in both GIVEN and EXPECT columns.
To do so, set the column type first (use a field whose type is a list or a map) and double click a cell in the column to input a value.
In the opened collection editor popup, create and manage the collection.
The created structure can be removed at any time using the *Remove* button.
