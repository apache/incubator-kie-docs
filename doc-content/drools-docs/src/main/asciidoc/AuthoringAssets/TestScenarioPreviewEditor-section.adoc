[[_drools.testscenarioprevieweditor]]
= Test Scenarios (Preview)

The aim of the new Test Scenarios (Preview) editor is to help the user test the proper function of created rules and knowledge bases.
Compared with the current Test Scenarios editor, the new version is significantly enhanced by an improved user experience that introduces a tabular layout, which guides the user during the definition of a scenario template and all the assorted test cases.
Running the defined scenarios verifies that the system works as expected and does not contain any regressions after a change.

.Example Test Scenario (Preview)

The editor's layout consists of a table, which contains a header and the individual rows.
The header (test scenario template) is divided into two parts; the *given* data object fields, which represent the input information, and the *expected* data object fields, whose values are checked based on the given information and which constitute the expected result.
The rows (test scenario definitions) represent the separate test cases.

An integral part of the editor is the right panel, which can be used for configuring the data object mappings or for accessing the cheat sheet that contains a set of notes used for quick reference.

NOTE: Because the editor is currently available only as a Preview, it is disabled by default.
To enable the editor, click *Settings* -> *Roles*, select a role from the left panel, click *Editors*, and from the list of exceptions, enable *Test Scenarios (Preview)*.
Save the changes.

WARNING: The project must contain a default KieSession to retrieve a corresponding KieBase.

== Creating a Test Scenario
To create a test scenario (Preview), make sure the Test Scenarios (Preview) editor is enabled.
Click *Add Asset* in the project Library a select *Test Scenario (Preview)*.
Enter a name of the test scenario and select a package.
After you click *Ok*, the editor opens.
All test scenarios (Preview) are files with the `.scesim` file name extension.

Hereinafter, the test scenario (Preview) asset will be referred to as a test scenario for simplification.

=== Loading and Importing Data Objects

All data objects that are located in the same package as a test scenario are automatically loaded and displayed in the right *Test Tools* panel in the *Test Editor* tab.
To update the list of data objects in the panel in case the data objects change (for example when a new data object is created or a data object is deleted), the test scenario must be closed and reopened.
After you click the name of the data object in the list, its fields and their types are displayed.

NOTE: To be able to click the name of the data object and display its fields, a column from the table must be selected first.
To select a column, click the column's header.
This enables you to define the column's type.
See section <<_drools.testscenariopreviewtemplate>> for more information.

.Test Tools panel

In the panel, it is possible to search the data objects using the *Search* text box. To search data object, start typing the name (or any part of the name) and press *Enter* or click the search button.

To load a data object that is located in a different package than the opened test scenario, the data object must be imported first.
To import a data object, select the *Data Objects* tab directly in the editor, click *New item* and in the *Add Import* dialog window, choose the data object from the drop-down list and click *Ok*.
After you save, close, and reopen the test scenario, the data object from a different package will be displayed in the list of all available data objects.

=== Basic Interaction Using the Contextual Menu

The contextual menu enables the user to perform basic operations on the table such as adding, deleting, and duplicating rows and columns.
To perform such interaction with the table, right-click on its any part.

.Contextual menu of a row

Based on the part of the table you select, different operations are available:

[[_drools.testscenariopreviewtemplate]]
== Test Scenario Template

The header of the test scenario table defines the template for each scenario.
Each column of the table, for both the given and expected parts, is mapped to a particular field of a defined data object.

To create a valid test scenario template, follow the procedure below.

.Creating a test scenario template
. Make sure all the required facts (data objects) are defined and available in the project.
. Create a test scenario and use the contextual menu to add all the needed columns or to remove the unnecessary ones.
. Click on a column's header to select a particular column and to enable the available data objects in the *Test Editor* tab.
. Select a data object and double click the chosen field to define a column's type and the correct mapping.
. Define the type of each column in the test scenario table.

.Example test scenario template

[[_drools.testscenariopreviewscenario]]
== Test Scenario Definition

The rows of the test scenario table define the individual test scenarios.
A test scenario has a unique index, description, set of input values (the *given* values), and a set of output values (the *expected* values).

To create test scenario definitions, follow the procedure below.

.Creating test scenario definitions
. Make sure the test scenario template is already defined.
. Use the contextual menu to add and remove individual test scenarios (rows in the table) as required.
. Write a description of a test scenario definition and input values into each cell of the row. Single click a cell to start the inline editing.
. Fill in the required values into each row of the test scenario table.

=== Expressions Syntax

The supported syntax of the test scenario definition expressions is as follows:

.Description of Expressions Syntax
[cols="1,1"]
|===
| Operator | Description

.^| `=`
.^| Specifies equality of a value. *This is the default operator of each column and the only operator that is supported for each given column.*

.^| `!`, `=!`, `<>`
.^| Specifies inequality of a value. This operator can be combined with other operators.

.^| `<`, `>`, `\<=`, `>=`
.^| Specifies a comparison: less than, greater than, less or equals than, and greater or equals than.

.^| `[value1, value2, value3]`
.^| Specifies a list of values. If *one or more* values are valid, the scenario definition is evaluated as true.

.^| `expression1; expression2; expression3`
.^| Specifies a list of expressions. If *all* expressions are valid, the scenario definition is evaluated as true.
|===

NOTE: An empty cell equals to `null`. To define an empty string, use `=`.

.Example Expressions
[cols="1,4"]
|===
| Expression | Meaning

.^| `-1`
.^| The actual value equals to -1.

.^| `< 0`
.^| The actual value is less than 0.

.^| `! > 0`
.^| The actual value is not greater than 0.

.^| `[-1, 0, 1]`
.^| The actual value equals either to -1, 0, or 1.

.^| `<> [1,-1]`
.^| The actual value is not equal to 1 or -1.

.^| `! 100; 0`
.^| The actual value is not equal to 100, but equals to 0.

.^| `!= < 0; <> > 1`
.^| The actual value is not less than 0 and is not greater than 1.

.^| `<> \<= 0; >= 1`
.^| The actual value is not less than 0 or equal to 0, but is equal to 1 or greater than 1.
|===

A quick overview of the supported commands and syntax is also available in the *Scenario Cheatsheet* tab on the right side of the editor.

[[_drools.testscenariopreviewrun]]
== Running a Test Scenario

Click *Run Test* at the top of the Test Scenarios (Preview) editor.
The *Reporting* panel opens at the bottom of the editor with the test results; a red bar indicates test failures whereas
a green bar indicates that all tests were successful.
Below the bar, information regarding the number of tests, duration, and the table that contains failures stack traces
is displayed.
