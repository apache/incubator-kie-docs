= Creating test scenario using the sample Mortgages project

This chapter illustrates creating and executing a test scenario from the sample *Mortgages* project shipped with {CENTRAL} using the test scenarios designer. The test scenario example in this chapter is based on the *Pricing loans* guided decision table from the *Mortgages* project.

.Procedure
. In {CENTRAL}, go to *Menu* -> *Design* -> *Projects* and click *Mortgages*.
. If the project is not listed under *Projects*, from *MySpace*, click the three dots (image:cases/dotdotdotbutton.png[]) in the upper-right corner of the page.
. Click *Try Samples* -> *Mortgages* -> *OK*.
+
The Assets window appears.
+
. Click *Add Asset* -> *Test Scenario*.
. Enter `scenario_pricing_loans` as the *Test Scenario* name and select the default `mortgages.mortgages` package from the *Package* drop-down list.
+
The package you select must contain all the required rule assets.
. Select *RULE* as the *Source type*.
. Click *Ok* to create and open the test scenario in the test scenarios designer.
. Expand *Project Explorer* and verify the following:
* `Applicant`, `Bankruptcy`, `IncomeSource`, and `LoanApplication` data objects exist.
* `Pricing loans` guide decision table exists.
* Verify that the new test scenario is listed under *Test Scenario*
. After verifying that everything is in place, return to the *Model* tab of the test scenarios designer and define the *GIVEN* and *EXPECT* data for the scenario, based on the available data objects.

. Define the *GIVEN* column details,
.. Click the cell named *INSTANCE 1* under the *GIVEN* column header.
.. From *Test Tools* panel, select *LoanApplication* data object.
.. Click *Add*.
. To create properties of the data object, right-click the property cell and select *Insert column right* or *Insert column left* as required. For this example, you need to create two more property cells under the *GIVEN* column.
. Click the first property cell,
.. From *Test Tools* panel, select and expand the *LoanApplication* data object.
.. Click *amount* and then *Add* to map the data object field to the property cell.
. Click the second property cell,
.. From *Test Tools* panel, select and expand the *LoanApplication* data object.
.. Click *deposit* and then *Add*.
. Click the third property cell,
.. From *Test Tools* panel, select and expand the *LoanApplication* data object.
.. Click *lengthYears* and then *Add*.
. Right-click *LoanApplication* header cell and select *Insert column right*. A new *GIVEN* column to the right is created.
. Click the new header cell,
.. From *Test Tools* panel, select the *IncomeSource* data object.
.. Click *Add* to map the data object to the header cell.
. Click the property cell below *IncomeSource*,
.. From *Test Tools* panel, select and expand the *IncomeSource* data object.
.. Click *type* and then *Add* to map the data object field to the property cell.
+
You have now defined all the *GIVEN* column cells.
+
. Next, define the *EXPECT* column details,
.. Click the cell named *INSTANCE 2* under the *EXPECT* column header.
.. From *Test Tools* panel, select *LoanApplication* data object.
.. Click *Add*.
. To create properties of the data object, right-click the property cell and select *Insert column right* or *Insert column left* as required. Create two more property cells under the *EXPECT* column.
. Click the first property cell,
.. From *Test Tools* panel, select and expand the *LoanApplication* data object.
.. Click *approved* and then *Add* to map the data object field to the property cell.
. Click the second property cell,
.. From *Test Tools* panel, select and expand the *LoanApplication* data object.
.. Click *insuranceCost* and then *Add*.
. Click the third property cell,
.. From *Test Tools* panel, select and expand the *LoanApplication* data object.
.. Click *approvedRate* and then *Add*.
. Now for defining the test scenario, enter the following data in the first row:
* Enter `Row 1 test scenario` as the *Scenario Description*, `150000` as the *amount*, `19000` as the *deposit*, `30` as the *lenghtYears*, and `Asset` as the *type* for the *GIVEN* column values.
* Enter `true` as *approved*, `0` as the *insuranceCost* and `2` as the *approvedRate* for the *EXPECT* column values.
. Next enter the following data in the second row:
* Enter `Row 2 test scenario` as the *Scenario Description*, `100002` as the *amount*, `2999` as the *deposit*, `20` as the *lenghtYears*, and `Job` as the *type* for the *GIVEN* column values.
* Enter `true` as *approved*, `10` as the *insuranceCost* and `6` as the *approvedRate* for the *EXPECT* column values.
. After you have defined all *GIVEN*, *EXPECT*, and other data for the scenario, click *Save* in the test scenarios designer to save your work.
. Click *Run Test* in the upper-right corner to run the `.scesim` file.
+
The test result is displayed in the *Test Report* panel. Click *View Alerts* to display messages from the *Alerts* section. If a test fails, refer to the messages in the *Alerts* section at the bottom of the window, review and correct all components in the scenario, and try again to validate the scenario until the scenario passes.
+
. Click *Save* in the test scenarios designer to save your work after you have made all necessary changes.
