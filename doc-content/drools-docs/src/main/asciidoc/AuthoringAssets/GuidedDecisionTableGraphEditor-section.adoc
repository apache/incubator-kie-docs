= Guided decision table graphs

Whilst it is possible to author single Guided Decision Tables it is also possible to author a graph of related tables where an action of one may provide a potential match for a condition of another. In this scenario the tables are said to be related.

== Editor

The editor itself preserves all the features of the Guided Decision Table Editor merely adding the ability to visualise multiple tables and their relationships in a single view. Selecting a single table leads to the column definitions panel, Source and Data Objects tabs being updated to reflect the selected table. Validation & Verification reporting is also updated to reflect the selected table. The Overview tab maintains state of the graph as a whole.

== Creating a new graph

When a new "Guided Decision Table Graph" is first created the target package is scanned for existing single Guided Decision Tables. Those found are checked for relationships and, if any exist, added automatically to the new graph.

== Adding new tables to the graph

Tables can be added to the graph by clicking on the "Documents..." menu entry. This reveals a tool panel that lists the tables already part of the graph. The same panel gives the User the ability to either add a new table or open an existing table.

=== Adding new tables

Clicking on "New..." launches the New Guided Decision Table Wizard. On completion of the Wizard the new table will be added to the graph and any relationships automatically added.

=== Adding existing tables

Clicking on "Open..." reveals a file selector wherefrom one or more existing Guided Decision Tables can be selected and added to the graph. If no additional Guided Decision Tables are found a message is shown to the User.

== Removing tables

Tables can be removed from the graph by opening the "Documents..." panel and clicking on the "X" icon beside the table. Tables removed from the graph are not deleted from the Project and can continue to be edited by the Gudied Decision Table Editor.
