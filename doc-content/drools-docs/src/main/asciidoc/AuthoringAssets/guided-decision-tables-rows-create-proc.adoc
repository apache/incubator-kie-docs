+
. After you define all rows of data in the guided decision table, click *Validate* in the upper-right toolbar of the guided decision tables designer to validate the table. If the table validation fails, address any problems described in the error message, review all components in the table, and try again to validate the table until the table passes.

NOTE: Although guided decision tables have real-time verification and validation, you should still manually validate the completed decision table to ensure optimal results.

. Click *Save* in the table designer to save your changes.
