= "Set the value of a field"

With this column option, you can implement an action to set the value of a field on a previously bound fact for the "THEN" portion of the rule.
You have the option to notify the {ENGINE} of the modified values which could lead to other rules being reactivated.

.Required column parameters
The following parameters are required in the *Add a new column* wizard to set up this column type:

* *Pattern:* Select from the list of fact patterns already used in conditions or condition BRL fragments in your table or create a new fact pattern. A fact pattern is a combination of an available data object in the package (see the note on xref:required-data-objects[Required data objects] for details) and a model class binding that you specify. (Examples: `LoanApplication [application]` or `IncomeSource [income]` where the bracketed portion is the binding to the given fact type)
* *Field:* Select a field from the previously specified fact pattern. The field options are defined in the fact file in the *Data Objects* panel of your project. (Examples: `amount` or `lengthYears` fields within the `LoanApplication` fact type)
* *Value list (optional):* Enter a list of value options, delimited by a comma and space, to limit table input data for the action ("THEN") portion of the rule. When this value list is defined, the values will be provided in the table cells for that column as a drop-down list, from which users can select only one option. (Example list: `Accepted, Declined, Pending`)
* *Default value (optional):* Select one of the previously defined value options as the default value that will appear in the cell automatically in a new row. If the default value is not specified, the table cell will be blank by default. You can also select a default value from any previously configured data enumerations in the project, listed in the *Enumeration Definitions* panel of the Project Explorer. (You can create enumerations in *Menu* -> *Design* -> *Projects* -> *_[select project]_* -> *Add Asset* -> *Enumeration*.)
* *Header (description):* Add header text for the column.
* *Hide column:* Select this to hide the column, or clear this to display the column.
* *Logically insert:* This option appears when the selected Fact Pattern is not currently used in another column in the guided decision table (see the next field description). Select this to insert the fact pattern logically into the {ENGINE}, or clear this to insert it regularly. The {PRODUCT} {ENGINE} is responsible for logical decisions on insertions and retractions of facts. After regular or stated insertions, facts have to be retracted explicitly. After logical insertions, facts are automatically retracted when the conditions that asserted the facts in the first place are no longer true.
//Remove for now.
//For more details, see {URL_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE}#sect_truth_maintenance[Truth Maintenance] in the _{DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE}_.
* *Update engine with changes:* This option appears when the selected Fact Pattern is already used in another column in the guided decision table. Select this to update the {ENGINE} with the modified field values, or clear this to not update the {ENGINE}.
