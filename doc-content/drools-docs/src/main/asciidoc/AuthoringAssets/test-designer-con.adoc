= Test scenarios designer in {CENTRAL}

The test scenarios designer provides a tabular layout that helps you in defining a scenario template and all the associated test cases. The designer layout consists of a table which has a header and the individual rows. The header consists of three parts, the *GIVEN* and *EXPECT* row, a row with instances, and a row with corresponding fields. The header is also known as test scenario template and the individual rows are called test scenarios definitions.

The test scenario template or header has the following two parts:

* *GIVEN* data objects and their fields - represents the input information
* *EXPECT* data objects and their fields - represents the objects and their fields whose exact values are checked based on the given information and which also constitutes the expected result.

The test scenarios definitions represent the separate test cases of a template.

You can access the *Project Explorer* from the left panel of the designer whereas from the right panel you can access the *Settings*, *Test Tools*, *Scenario Cheatsheet*, *Test Report* and the *Coverage Report* tabs. You can access the *Settings* tab to view and edit the global settings of rule-based and DMN-based test scenarios. You can use the *Test Tools* to configure the data object mappings. *Scenario Cheatsheet* tab contains notes and the cheat sheet which you can use as reference. The *Test Report* tab displays the overview of the tests and the scenario status. To view the test coverage statistics, you can use the *Coverage Report* tab from the right side of the test scenario designer.
