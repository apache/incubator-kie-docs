= Disabling verification and validation of guided decision tables

The decision table verification and validation feature of {CENTRAL} is enabled by default. This feature helps you validate your guided decision tables, but with complex guided decision tables, this feature can hinder {DECISION_ENGINE} performance. You can disable this feature by setting the `org.kie.verification.disable-dtable-realtime-verification` system property value to `true` in your {PRODUCT} distribution.

.Procedure
Navigate to `~/standalone-full.xml` and add the following system property:

[source]
----
<property name="org.kie.verification.disable-dtable-realtime-verification" value="true"/>
----

ifdef::DM,PAM[]
For example, on {EAP}, you add this system property in `$EAP_HOME/standalone/configuration/standalone-full.xml`.
endif::[]
