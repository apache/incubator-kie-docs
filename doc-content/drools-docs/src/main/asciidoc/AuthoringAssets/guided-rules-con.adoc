= Guided rules

Guided rules are business rules that you create in a UI-based guided rules designer in {CENTRAL} that leads you through the rule-creation process. The guided rules designer provides fields and options for acceptable input based on the data objects for the rule being defined. The guided rules that you define are compiled into Drools Rule Language (DRL) rules as with all other rule assets.

All data objects related to a guided rule must be in the same project package as the guided rule. Assets in the same package are imported by default. After you create the necessary data objects and the guided rule, you can use the *Data Objects* tab of the guided rules designer to verify that all required data objects are listed or to import other existing data objects by adding a *New item*.
