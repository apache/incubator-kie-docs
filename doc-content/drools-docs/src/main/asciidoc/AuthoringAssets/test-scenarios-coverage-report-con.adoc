= Coverage reports for test scenarios

The test scenario designer provides a clear and coherent way of displaying the test coverage statistics using the *Coverage Report* tab on the right side of the test scenario designer. You can also download the coverage report to view and analyze the test coverage statistics. Downloaded test scenario coverage report supports the `.CSV` file format. For more information about the RFC specification for the Comma-Separated Values (CSV) format, see https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180[Common Format and MIME Type for Comma-Separated Values (CSV) Files].

You can view the coverage report for rule-based and DMN-based test scenarios.
