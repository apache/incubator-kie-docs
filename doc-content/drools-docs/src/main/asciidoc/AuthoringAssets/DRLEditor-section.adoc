= DRL file


DRL files are stored as text - they can be managed in Drools Workbench.
A DRL file can contain one or several globals, rules, functions, enumerations, type declarations or anything that is supported by the DRL language.
Normally you would use the IDE to edit raw DRL files, since it has all the advanced tooling and content assistance and debugging.
However, there are times when a rule may have to deal with something fairly technical in a package in Drools Workbench.
In any typical package of rules, you generally have a need for some "technical rules" - you can mix and match all the rule types together of course.
