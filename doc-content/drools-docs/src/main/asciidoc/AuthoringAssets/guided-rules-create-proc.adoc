= Creating guided rules

Guided rules enable you to define business rules in a structured format, based on the data objects associated with the rules. You can create and define guided rules individually for your project.

.Procedure
. In {CENTRAL}, go to *Menu* -> *Design* -> *Projects* and click the project name.
. Click *Add Asset* -> *Guided Rule*.
. Enter an informative *Guided Rule* name and select the appropriate *Package*. The package that you specify must be the same package where the required data objects have been assigned or will be assigned.
+
You can also select *Show declared DSL sentences* if any domain specific language (DSL) assets have been defined in your project. These DSL assets will then become usable objects for conditions and actions that you define in the guided rules designer.
+
. Click *Ok* to create the rule asset.
+
The new guided rule is now listed in the *Guided Rules* panel of the *Project Explorer*, or in the *Guided Rules (with DSL)* panel if you selected the *Show declared DSL sentences* option.
. Click the *Data Objects* tab and confirm that all data objects required for your rules are listed. If not, click *New item* to import data objects from other packages, or
ifdef::DM,PAM[]
xref:data-objects-create-proc_guided-rules[create data objects]
endif::[]
ifdef::DROOLS,JBPM,OP[]
xref:_wb.datamodeller[create data objects]
endif::[]
within your package.
. After all data objects are in place, return to the *Model* tab of the guided rules designer and use the buttons on the right side of the window to add and define the *WHEN* (condition) and *THEN* (action) sections of the rule, based on the available data objects.

+
The *WHEN* part of the rule contains the conditions that must be met to execute an action. For example, if a bank requires loan applicants to have over 21 years of age, then the *WHEN* condition of an `Underage` rule would be `Age | less than | 21`.
+
The *THEN* part of the rule contains the actions to be performed when the conditional part of the rule has been met. For example, when the loan applicant is under 21 years old, the *THEN* action would set `approved` to `false`, declining the loan because the applicant is under age.
+
You can also specify exceptions for more complex rules, such as if a bank may approve of an under-aged applicant when a guarantor is involved. In that case, you would create or import a *guarantor* data object and then add the field to the guided rule.
+
. After you define all components of the rule, click *Validate* in the upper-right toolbar of the guided rules designer to validate the guided rule. If the rule validation fails, address any problems described in the error message, review all components in the rule, and try again to validate the rule until the rule passes.
. Click *Save* in the guided rules designer to save your work.
