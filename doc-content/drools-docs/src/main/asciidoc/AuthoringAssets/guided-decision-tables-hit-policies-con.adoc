= Hit policies for guided decision tables

Hit policies determine the order in which rules (rows) in a guided decision table are applied, whether top to bottom, per specified priority, or other options.

The following hit policies are available:

* *None:* (Default hit policy) Multiple rows can be executed and the verification warns about rows that conflict. Any decision tables that have been uploaded (using a non-guided decision table spreadsheet) will adopt this hit policy.

* *Resolved Hit:* Only one row at a time can be executed according to specified priority, regardless of list order (you can give row 10 priority over row 5, for example). This means you can keep the order of the rows you want for visual readability, but specify priority exceptions.

* *Unique Hit:* Only one row at a time can be executed, and each row must be unique, with no overlap of conditions being met. If more than one row is executed, then the verification produces a warning at development time.

* *First Hit:* Only one row at a time can be executed in the order listed in the table, top to bottom.

* *Rule Order:* Multiple rows can be executed and verification does not report conflicts between the rows since they are expected to happen.
