= Spreadsheet decision tables


Multiple rules can be stored in a spreadsheet. Each row in the spreadsheet is a rule, and each column is either a condition, an action, or an option. The Drools Expert section of this document discusses spreadsheet decision tables in more detail.

To use a spreadsheet, you upload an XLS or XLSX file. To create a new decision table: launch the new "Decision Table (Spreadsheet)" wizard, you will get an option to upload one.
