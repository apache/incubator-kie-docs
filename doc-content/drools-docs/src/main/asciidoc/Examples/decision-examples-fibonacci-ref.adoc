= Fibonacci example decisions (recursion and conflict resolution)

The Fibonacci example decision set demonstrates how the decision engine uses recursion to resolve execution conflicts for rules in a sequence. The example focuses on resolving conflicts through salience values that you can define in rules.

The following is an overview of the Fibonacci example:

* *Name*: `fibonacci`
* *Main class*: `org.drools.examples.fibonacci.FibonacciExample` (in `src/main/java`)
* *Module*: `drools-examples`
* *Type*: Java application
* *Rule file*: `org.drools.examples.fibonacci.Fibonacci.drl` (in `src/main/resources`)
* *Objective*: Demonstrates recursion and conflict resolution through rule salience

The Fibonacci Numbers form a sequence starting with 0 and 1. The next Fibonacci number is obtained by adding the two preceding Fibonacci numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597, 2584, 4181, 6765, 10946, and so on.

The Fibonacci example uses the single fact class `Fibonacci` with the following two fields:

* `sequence`
* `value`

The `sequence` field indicates the position of the object in the Fibonacci number sequence. The `value` field shows the value of that Fibonacci object for that sequence position, where `-1` indicates a value that still needs to be computed.

.Fibonacci class
[source,java]
----
public static class Fibonacci {
    private int  sequence;
    private long value;

    public Fibonacci( final int sequence ) {
        this.sequence = sequence;
        this.value = -1;
    }

    ... setters and getters go here...

To execute the example, run the `org.drools.examples.fibonacci.FibonacciExample` class as a Java application in your IDE.

After the execution, the following output appears in the IDE console window:

To achieve this behavior in Java, the example inserts a single `Fibonacci` object with a sequence field of `50`. The example then uses a recursive rule to insert the other 49 `Fibonacci` objects.

Instead of implementing the `PropertyChangeSupport` interface to use dynamic facts, this example uses the MVEL dialect `modify` keyword to enable a block setter action and notify the engine of changes.

.Fibonacci example execution

[source,java]
----
ksession.insert( new Fibonacci( 50 ) );
ksession.fireAllRules();
----

This example uses the following three rules:

* `"Recurse"`
* `"Bootstrap"`
* `"Calculate"`

The rule `"Recurse"` matches each asserted `Fibonacci` object with a value of `-1`, creating and asserting a new `Fibonacci` object with a sequence of one less than the currently matched object. Each time a Fibonacci object is added while the one with a sequence field equal to `1` does not exist, the rule re-matches and fires again. The `not` conditional element is used to stop the rule matching once you have all 50 Fibonacci objects in memory. The rule also has a `salience` value because you need to have all 50 `Fibonacci` objects asserted before you execute the `"Bootstrap"` rule.

.Rule "Recurse"
[source]
----
rule "Recurse"
    salience 10
  when
    f : Fibonacci ( value == -1 )
    not ( Fibonacci ( sequence == 1 ) )
  then
    insert( new Fibonacci( f.sequence - 1 ) );
    System.out.println( "recurse for " + f.sequence );
end
----

To better understand the execution flow of this example, you can load the audit log file from `target/fibonacci.log` into your IDE debug view or *Audit View*, if available (for example, in *Window* -> *Show View* in some IDEs).

In this example, the *Audit View* shows the original assertion of the `Fibonacci` object with a `sequence` field of `50`, done from Java code. From there on, the *Audit View* shows the continual recursion of the rule, where each asserted `Fibonacci` object causes the `"Recurse"` rule to become activated and to fire again.

When a `Fibonacci` object with a `sequence` field of `2` is asserted, the `"Bootstrap"` rule is matched and activated along with the `"Recurse"` rule. Notice the multiple restrictions on field `sequence` that test for equality with `1` or `2`:

.Rule "Bootstrap"
[source]
----
rule "Bootstrap"
  when
    f : Fibonacci( sequence == 1 || == 2, value == -1 ) // multi-restriction
  then
    modify ( f ){ value = 1 };
    System.out.println( f.sequence + " == " + f.value );
end
----

You can also use the *Agenda View* in your IDE to investigate the state of the engine agenda. The `"Bootstrap"` rule does not fire yet because the `"Recurse"` rule has a higher salience value.

When a `Fibonacci` object with a `sequence` of `1` is asserted, the `"Bootstrap"` rule is matched again, causing two activations for this rule. The `"Recurse"` rule does not match and activate because the `not` conditional element stops the rule matching as soon as a `Fibonacci` object with a `sequence` of `1` exists.

The `"Bootstrap"` rule sets the objects with a `sequence` of `1` and `2` to a value of `1`. Now that you have two `Fibonacci` objects with values not equal to `-1`, the `"Calculate"` rule is able to match.

At this point in the example, nearly 50 `Fibonacci` objects exist in the working memory. You need to select a suitable triple to calculate each of their values in turn. If you use three Fibonacci patterns in a rule without field constraints to confine the possible cross products, the result would be 50x49x48 possible combinations, leading to about 125,000 possible rule firings, most of them incorrect.

The `"Calculate"` rule uses field constraints to evaluate the three Fibonacci patterns in the correct order. This technique is called __cross-product matching__.

The first pattern finds any `Fibonacci` object with a value `!= -1` and binds both the pattern and the field. The second `Fibonacci` object does the same thing, but adds an additional field constraint to ensure that its sequence is greater by one than the `Fibonacci` object bound to `f1`. When this rule fires for the first time, you know that only sequences `1` and `2` have values of `1`, and the two constraints ensure that `f1` references sequence `1` and that `f2` references sequence `2`.

The final pattern finds the `Fibonacci` object with a value equal to `-1` and with a sequence one greater than `f2`.

At this point in the example, three `Fibonacci` objects are correctly selected from the available cross products, and you can calculate the value for the third `Fibonacci` object that is bound to `f3`.

.Rule "Calculate"
[source]
----
rule "Calculate"
  when
    // Bind f1 and s1.
    f1 : Fibonacci( s1 : sequence, value != -1 )
    // Bind f2 and v2, refer to bound variable s1.
    f2 : Fibonacci( sequence == (s1 + 1), v2 : value != -1 )
    // Bind f3 and s3, alternative reference of f2.sequence.
    f3 : Fibonacci( s3 : sequence == (f2.sequence + 1 ), value == -1 )
  then
    // Note the various referencing techniques.
    modify ( f3 ) { value = f1.value + v2 };
    System.out.println( s3 + " == " + f3.value );
end
----

The `modify` statement updates the value of the `Fibonacci` object bound to `f3`. This means that you now have another new `Fibonacci` object with a value not equal to `-1`, which allows the `"Calculate"` rule to re-match and calculate the next Fibonacci number.

The debug view or *Audit View* of your IDE shows how the firing of the last `"Bootstrap"` rule modifies the `Fibonacci` object, enabling the `"Calculate"` rule to match, which then modifies another `Fibonacci` object that enables the `"Calculate"` rule to match again. This process continues until the value is set for all `Fibonacci` objects.
