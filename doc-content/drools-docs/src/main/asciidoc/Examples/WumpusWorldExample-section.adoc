Wumpus World is an AI example covered in the book "Artificial Intelligence : A Modern Approach". When the game first starts all the cells are greyed out.
As you walk around they become visible.
The cave has pits, a wumpus and gold.
When you are next to a pit you will feel a breeze, when you are next to the wumpus you will smell a stench and see glitter when next to gold.
The sensor icons are shown above the move buttons.
If you walk into a pit or the wumpus, you die.
