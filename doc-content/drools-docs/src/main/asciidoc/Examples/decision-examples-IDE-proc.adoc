= Importing and executing {PRODUCT} example decisions in an IDE

You can import {PRODUCT} example decisions into your integrated development environment (IDE) and execute them to explore how the rules and code function. You can use these examples to better understand {DECISION_ENGINE} capabilities or use them as a reference for the decisions that you define in your own {PRODUCT} projects.

.Prerequisites
* Java 8 or later is installed.
* Maven 3.5.x or later is installed.
* An IDE is installed, such as
ifdef::DM,PAM[]
Red Hat CodeReady Studio.
endif::[]
ifdef::DROOLS,JBPM,OP[]
Eclipse.
endif::[]

.Procedure
ifdef::DM,PAM[]
. Download and unzip the *Red Hat Process Automation Manager {PRODUCT_VERSION_LONG} Source Distribution* from the https://access.redhat.com/jbossnetwork/restricted/listSoftware.html[Red Hat Customer Portal] to a temporary directory, such as `/{PRODUCT_FILE}-sources`.
endif::[]
ifdef::DROOLS,JBPM,OP[]
. Download and unzip the source from the {PRODUCT} https://github.com/kiegroup/drools/archive/master.zip[repository in GitHub].
+
For the Conway’s Game of Life example decision, also download and unzip the source from the {PRODUCT_DROOLS} and {PRODUCT_JBPM} integration https://github.com/kiegroup/droolsjbpm-integration/archive/master.zip[repository in GitHub].
endif::[]
. Open your IDE and select *File* -> *Import* -> *Maven* -> *Existing Maven Projects*, or the equivalent option for importing a Maven project.
. Click *Browse*, navigate to
ifdef::DM,PAM[]
`~/{PRODUCT_FILE}-sources/src/drools-$VERSION/drools-examples` (or, for the Conway’s Game of Life example, `~/{PRODUCT_FILE}-sources/src/droolsjbpm-integration-$VERSION/droolsjbpm-integration-examples`),
endif::[]
ifdef::DROOLS,JBPM[]
`~/drools-master/drools-examples` (or, for the Conway’s Game of Life example, `~/droolsjbpm-integration-examples`),
endif::[]
and import the project.
. Navigate to the example package that you want to run and find the Java class with the `main` method.
. Right-click the Java class and select *Run As* -> *Java Application* to run the example.

To run all examples through a basic user interface, run the `DroolsExamplesApp.java` class (or, for Conway's Game of Life, the `DroolsJbpmIntegrationExamplesApp.java` class) in the `org.drools.examples` main class.
