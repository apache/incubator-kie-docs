= Banking example decisions (pattern matching, sorting, and calculation)

The Banking example decision set demonstrates the process of developing a complete personal banking application to handle credits and debits in multiple accounts. The example uses a set of design patterns that have been created for the banking process.

The following is an overview of the Banking example:

* *Name*: `banking`
* *Main class*: `org.drools.examples.banking.BankingExamplesApp` (in `src/main/java`)
* *Module*: `drools-examples`
* *Type*: Java application
* *Rule files*: `org.drools.examples.banking.*.drl` (in `src/main/resources`)
* *Objective*: Demonstrates pattern matching, basic sorting, and calculation

In this example, the class `RuleRunner` executes one or more DRL files against a set of data. The class compiles the packages and creates the KIE base for each execution, enabling you to easily execute each scenario and inspect the outputs. In a production environment, the KIE base should be built just once and cached, but for the purposes of this example, the `RuleRunner` class is used for efficiency.

.RuleRunner class
[source,java]
----
public class RuleRunner {

    public RuleRunner() {
    }

    public void runRules(String[] rules,
                         Object[] facts) throws Exception {

        KnowledgeBase kbase = KnowledgeBaseFactory.newKnowledgeBase();
        KnowledgeBuilder kbuilder = KnowledgeBuilderFactory.newKnowledgeBuilder();

        for ( int i = 0; i < rules.length; i++ ) {
            String ruleFile = rules[i];
            System.out.println( "Loading file: " + ruleFile );
            kbuilder.add( ResourceFactory.newClassPathResource( ruleFile,
                                                                RuleRunner.class ),
                          ResourceType.DRL );
        }

        Collection<KnowledgePackage> pkgs = kbuilder.getKnowledgePackages();
        kbase.addKnowledgePackages( pkgs );
        StatefulKnowledgeSession ksession = kbase.newStatefulKnowledgeSession();

        for ( int i = 0; i < facts.length; i++ ) {
            Object fact = facts[i];
            System.out.println( "Inserting fact: " + fact );
            ksession.insert( fact );
        }

        ksession.fireAllRules();
    }
}

To execute the example, run the `org.drools.examples.banking.BankingExamplesApp` class as a Java application in your IDE.

After the execution, a basic user interface window appears that you can use to run each example within the example set:

.Banking example GUI
image::Examples/BankingExample/Banking-GUI.png[]

Each example that you run displays an execution output in the IDE console window:

== Preliminary classes and rules

The first sample Java class `BankingExample1` loads and executes a single DRL file, `Example.drl`, without inserting any data:

.BankingExample1 class
[source,java]
----
public class BankingExample1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        new RuleRunner().runRules( new String[] { "Example1.drl" },
                                   new Object[0] );
    }
}
----

The first sample rule `Example1.drl` has a single `eval` condition that is always true so that this rule will match and fire one time after the start:

.Rule in Example1.drl
[source]
----
rule "Rule 01"
    when
        eval( 1==1 )
    then
        System.out.println( "Rule 01 Works" );
end
----

When you execute the rule, the following output shows that the rule matches and executes the single print statement:

.BankingExample1.java output in the IDE console
[source]
----
Loading file: Example1.drl
Rule 01 Works
----

The next class `BankingExample2` asserts basic facts and prints the output:

// Internal note: This and a couple of other Java examples are shown as invalid by the ascii Java highlighter (removing the second { in this case makes it happy, which is not correct). But I've confirmed in the IDE validator and with SMEs that the code snippets in this section are in fact all correct and that it seems to be a bug with the ascii Java validator. (Stetson, 12 Dec 2018)

.BankingExample2 class
[source,java]
----
public class BankingExample2 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Number[] numbers = new Number[] {wrap(3), wrap(1), wrap(4), wrap(1), wrap(5)};
        new RuleRunner().runRules( new String[] { "Example2.drl" },
                                   numbers );
    }

    private static Integer wrap(int i) {
        return new Integer(i);
    }
}
----

The Banking example does not use any specific facts and instead asserts a set of `java.lang.Integer` objects. In a production environment, a number is not a useful fact, but for the sake of this example, this approach is used to demonstrate basic techniques before more complexity is added.

The `Example2.drl` rule prints the numbers:

.Rule in Example2.drl
[source]
----
rule "Rule 02"
    when
        Number( $intValue : intValue )
    then
        System.out.println( "Number found with value: " + $intValue );
end
----

This rule identifies any facts that are `Number` objects and prints out the values. Notice the use of the abstract class `Number`. Although this example inserts `Integer` objects, the rule now identifies any kind of number. The pattern-matching functionality of the decision engine is able to match interfaces and superclasses of asserted objects.

The output shows the DRL being loaded, the facts inserted, and then the matched and fired rules. Each inserted number is matched, fired, and printed:

.BankingExample2.java output in the IDE console
[source]
----
Loading file: Example2.drl
Inserting fact: 3
Inserting fact: 1
Inserting fact: 4
Inserting fact: 1
Inserting fact: 5
Number found with value: 5
Number found with value: 1
Number found with value: 4
Number found with value: 1
Number found with value: 3
----

You can use more efficient ways to sort numbers than using rules, but because other segments of the Banking example apply cash flows in date order in banking rules, the example uses a basic rule-based sorting technique.

In the `BankingExample3.java` class, the example again inserts the `Integer` objects but uses `Example3.drl`:

.BankingExample3.java class
[source,java]
----
public class BankingExample3 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Number[] numbers = new Number[] {wrap(3), wrap(1), wrap(4), wrap(1), wrap(5)};
        new RuleRunner().runRules( new String[] { "Example3.drl" },
                                   numbers );
    }

    private static Integer wrap(int i) {
        return new Integer(i);
    }
}
----

.Rule in Example3.drl
[source]
----
rule "Rule 03"
    when
        $number : Number( )
        not Number( intValue < $number.intValue )
    then
        System.out.println("Number found with value: " + $number.intValue() );
        delete( $number );
end
----

The `when` condition of the rule identifies a `Number` and extracts the value, and then ensures that no number exists that is smaller than the one found by the first pattern. The typical behavior is to match only one number, the smallest in the set. However, the deletion (retraction) of the number after it has been printed means that the smallest number has been removed, revealing the next smallest number, and so on.

The resulting output shows that the numbers are now sorted numerically:

.BankingExample3.java class output in the IDE console

----

Inserting fact: 3
Inserting fact: 1
Inserting fact: 4
Inserting fact: 1

Number found with value: 1
Number found with value: 3
Number found with value: 4
Number found with value: 5

== Cash flow classes and rules

From this point, the Banking example begins to demonstrate personal accounting rules with cash flow.

The example first creates a `Cashflow` object:

.Cashflow class
[source,java]
----
public class Cashflow {
    private Date   date;
    private double amount;

    public Cashflow() {
    }

    public Cashflow(Date date, double amount) {
        this.date = date;
        this.amount = amount;
    }

    public Date getDate() {
        return date;
    }

    public void setDate(Date date) {
        this.date = date;
    }

    public double getAmount() {
        return amount;
    }

    public void setAmount(double amount) {
        this.amount = amount;
    }

    public String toString() {
        return "Cashflow[date=" + date + ",amount=" + amount + "]";
    }
}
----

The `Cashflow` class has the following two attributes:

* `date`
* `amount`

The class also contains an overloaded constructor to set the values, and a method `toString` to print a cash flow. Although the example uses the type `double` for efficiency, in a production environment, use a different approach for monetary units because floating point numbers cannot represent most numbers accurately.

The `BankingExample4.java` class inserts five `Cashflow` objects, with varying dates and amounts:

.BankingExample4.java class
[source,java]
----
public class BankingExample4 {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Object[] cashflows = {
            new Cashflow(new SimpleDate("01/01/2007"), 300.00),
            new Cashflow(new SimpleDate("05/01/2007"), 100.00),
            new Cashflow(new SimpleDate("11/01/2007"), 500.00),
            new Cashflow(new SimpleDate("07/01/2007"), 800.00),
            new Cashflow(new SimpleDate("02/01/2007"), 400.00),
        };

        new RuleRunner().runRules( new String[] { "Example4.drl" },
                                   cashflows );
    }
}
----

The convenience class `SimpleDate` extends `java.util.Date`, providing a constructor that takes a String as input and defines a date format:

.SimpleDate class
[source,java]
----
public class SimpleDate extends Date {
    private static final SimpleDateFormat format = new SimpleDateFormat("dd/MM/yyyy");

    public SimpleDate(String datestr) throws Exception {
        setTime(format.parse(datestr).getTime());
    }
}
----

The rule `Example4.drl` then prints the sorted `Cashflow` objects:

.Rule in Example4.drl
[source]
----
rule "Rule 04"
    when
        $cashflow : Cashflow( $date : date, $amount : amount )
        not Cashflow( date < $date)
    then
        System.out.println("Cashflow: "+$date+" :: "+$amount);
        delete($cashflow);
end
----

The `when` condition of the rule identifies a `Cashflow` object and extracts the date and the amount, and then ensures that no `Cashflow` object exists with an earlier date than the one found.

The `then` action of the rule prints the `Cashflow` object that satisfies the rule and then deletes (retracts) it, making way for the next earliest `Cashflow`.

The resulting output shows the selected cash flow:

.BankingExample4.java class output in the IDE console
[source]
----
Loading file: Example4.drl
Inserting fact: Cashflow[date=Mon Jan 01 00:00:00 GMT 2007,amount=300.0]

Inserting fact: Cashflow[date=Thu Jan 11 00:00:00 GMT 2007,amount=500.0]
Inserting fact: Cashflow[date=Sun Jan 07 00:00:00 GMT 2007,amount=800.0]

Cashflow: Fri Jan 05 00:00:00 GMT 2007 :: 100.0
Cashflow: Sun Jan 07 00:00:00 GMT 2007 :: 800.0
Cashflow: Thu Jan 11 00:00:00 GMT 2007 :: 500.0
----

Next, the example extends the `Cashflow` object, resulting in a `TypedCashflow` that can be a credit or a debit operation. The example could add this to the `Cashflow` type, but to keep the previous version of the class intact, the example uses the extension:

.TypedCashflow class
[source,java]
----
public class TypedCashflow extends Cashflow {
    public static final int CREDIT = 0;
    public static final int DEBIT  = 1;

    private int             type;

    public TypedCashflow() {
    }

    public TypedCashflow(Date date, int type, double amount) {
        super( date, amount );
        this.type = type;
    }

    public int getType() {
        return type;
    }

    public void setType(int type) {
        this.type = type;
    }

    public String toString() {
        return "TypedCashflow[date=" + getDate() +
               ",type=" + (type == CREDIT ? "Credit" : "Debit") +
               ",amount=" + getAmount() + "]";
    }
}
----

The sample class `BankingExample5` runs the `TypedCashflow` code:

.BankingExample5.java class
[source,java]
----
public class BankingExample5 {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Object[] cashflows = {
            new TypedCashflow(new SimpleDate("01/01/2007"),
                              TypedCashflow.CREDIT, 300.00),
            new TypedCashflow(new SimpleDate("05/01/2007"),
                              TypedCashflow.CREDIT, 100.00),
            new TypedCashflow(new SimpleDate("11/01/2007"),
                              TypedCashflow.CREDIT, 500.00),
            new TypedCashflow(new SimpleDate("07/01/2007"),
                              TypedCashflow.DEBIT, 800.00),
            new TypedCashflow(new SimpleDate("02/01/2007"),
                              TypedCashflow.DEBIT, 400.00),
        };

        new RuleRunner().runRules( new String[] { "Example5.drl" },
                                   cashflows );
    }
}
----

This class creates a set of `TypedCashflow` objects that are either credit or debit operations and uses the `Example5.drl` rule to print the sorted `TypedCashflow` objects:

.Rule in Example5.drl
[source]
----
rule "Rule 05"
    when
        $cashflow : TypedCashflow( $date : date,
                                   $amount : amount,
                                   type == TypedCashflow.CREDIT )
        not TypedCashflow( date < $date,
                           type == TypedCashflow.CREDIT )
    then
        System.out.println("Credit: "+$date+" :: "+$amount);
        delete($cashflow);
end
----

The `when` condition of the rule identifies a `TypedCashflow` fact with a type of `CREDIT` and extracts the date and the amount. The condition then ensures that no `TypedCashflow` of the same type exists with an earlier date than the one found.

The `then` action of the rule prints the `Cashflow` object that satisfies the patterns and then deletes (retracts) it, making way for the next earliest `Cashflow` of type `CREDIT`.

The resulting output shows the selected `TypedCashflow`:

== Accounts and allocated cash flow classes and rules

The next phase of the Banking example processes both credits and debits in two bank accounts and calculates the account balance. In order to do this, the example creates two separate `Account` objects and inserts them into the `Cashflow` objects before passing them to the decision engine. Creating the objects in this way provides easy access to the correct account without using helper classes.

The `Account` class is a basic Java object with an account number and balance:

.Account class
[source,java]
----
public class Account {
    private long   accountNo;
    private double balance = 0;

    public Account() {
    }

    public Account(long accountNo) {
        this.accountNo = accountNo;
    }

    public long getAccountNo() {
        return accountNo;
    }

    public void setAccountNo(long accountNo) {
        this.accountNo = accountNo;
    }

    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }

    public void setBalance(double balance) {
        this.balance = balance;
    }

    public String toString() {
        return "Account[" + "accountNo=" + accountNo + ",balance=" + balance + "]";
    }
}
----

The `AllocatedCashflow` class extends `TypedCashflow` to include an `Account` reference:

.AllocatedCashflow class
[source,java]
----
public class AllocatedCashflow extends TypedCashflow {
    private Account account;

    public AllocatedCashflow() {
    }

    public AllocatedCashflow(Account account,
                             Date date,
                             int type,
                             double amount) {
        super( date,
               type,
               amount );
        this.account = account;
    }

    public Account getAccount() {
        return account;
    }

    public void setAccount(Account account) {
        this.account = account;
    }

    public String toString() {
        return "AllocatedCashflow[" +
               "account=" + account +
               ",date=" + getDate() +
               ",type=" + (getType() == CREDIT ? "Credit" : "Debit") +
               ",amount=" + getAmount() + "]";
    }
}
----

The `BankingExample6.java` creates two `Account` objects and passes one of them into each `Cashflow` object in the constructor call:

.BankingExample6.java class
[source,java]
----
public class BankingExample6 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Account acc1 = new Account(1);
        Account acc2 = new Account(2);

        Object[] cashflows = {
            new AllocatedCashflow(acc1,new SimpleDate("01/01/2007"),
                                  TypedCashflow.CREDIT, 300.00),
            new AllocatedCashflow(acc1,new SimpleDate("05/02/2007"),
                                  TypedCashflow.CREDIT, 100.00),
            new AllocatedCashflow(acc2,new SimpleDate("11/03/2007"),
                                  TypedCashflow.CREDIT, 500.00),
            new AllocatedCashflow(acc1,new SimpleDate("07/02/2007"),
                                  TypedCashflow.DEBIT,  800.00),
            new AllocatedCashflow(acc2,new SimpleDate("02/03/2007"),
                                  TypedCashflow.DEBIT,  400.00),
            new AllocatedCashflow(acc1,new SimpleDate("01/04/2007"),
                                  TypedCashflow.CREDIT, 200.00),
            new AllocatedCashflow(acc1,new SimpleDate("05/04/2007"),
                                  TypedCashflow.CREDIT, 300.00),
            new AllocatedCashflow(acc2,new SimpleDate("11/05/2007"),
                                  TypedCashflow.CREDIT, 700.00),
            new AllocatedCashflow(acc1,new SimpleDate("07/05/2007"),
                                  TypedCashflow.DEBIT,  900.00),
            new AllocatedCashflow(acc2,new SimpleDate("02/05/2007"),
                                  TypedCashflow.DEBIT,  100.00)
        };

        new RuleRunner().runRules( new String[] { "Example6.drl" },
                                   cashflows );
    }
}
----

The rules in `Example6.drl` apply each `Cashflow` object in date order and then calculate and print the balance:

.Rules in Example6.drl
[source]
----
rule "Rule 06 - Credit"
    when
        $cashflow : AllocatedCashflow( $account : account,
                                       $date : date,

Although the example uses separate rules for credits and debits, the example does not specify a type when checking for earlier cash flows so that all cash flows are applied in date order, regardless of the cash flow type.

The `when` conditions of the rules identify the relevant account and the `then` actions of the rules update the account with the cash flow amount.

The resulting output shows the selected `AllocatedCashflow`:
