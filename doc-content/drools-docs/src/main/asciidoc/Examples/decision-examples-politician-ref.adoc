= Honest Politician example decisions (truth maintenance and salience)

The Honest Politician example decision set demonstrates the concept of truth maintenance with logical insertions and the use of salience in rules.

The following is an overview of the Honest Politician example:

* *Name*: `honestpolitician`
* *Main class*: `org.drools.examples.honestpolitician.HonestPoliticianExample` (in `src/main/java`)
* *Module*: `drools-examples`
* *Type*: Java application
* *Rule file*: `org.drools.examples.honestpolitician.HonestPolitician.drl` (in `src/main/resources`)
* *Objective*: Demonstrates the concept of truth maintenance based on the logical insertion of facts and the use of salience in rules

The basic premise of the Honest Politician example is that an object can only exist while a statement is true. A rule consequence can logically insert an object with the `insertLogical()` method. This means the object remains in the KIE session working memory as long as the rule that logically inserted it remains true. When the rule is no longer true, the object is automatically retracted.

In this example, rule execution causes a group of politicians to change from being honest to being dishonest as a result of a corrupt corporation. As each politician is evaluated, they start out with their honesty attribute being set to `true`, but a rule fires that makes the politicians no longer honest. As they switch their state from being honest to dishonest, they are then removed from the working memory. The rule salience notifies the {DECISION_ENGINE} how to prioritize any rules that have a salience defined for them, otherwise utilizing the default salience value of `0`. Rules with a higher salience value are given higher priority when ordered in the activation queue.

== Politician and Hope classes

The sample class `Politician` in the example is configured for an honest politician. The `Politician` class is made up of a String item `name` and a Boolean item `honest`:

.Politician class
[source,java]
----
public class Politician {
    private String name;
    private boolean honest;
    ...
}
----

The `Hope` class determines if a `Hope` object exists. This class has no meaningful members, but is present in the working memory as long as society has hope.

.Hope class
[source,java]
----
public class Hope {

    public Hope() {

    }
  }
----

== Rule definitions for politician honesty

In the Honest Politician example, when at least one honest politician exists in the working memory, the `"We have an honest Politician"` rule logically inserts a new `Hope` object. As soon as all politicians become dishonest, the `Hope` object is automatically retracted. This rule has a `salience` attribute with a value of `10` to ensure that it fires before any other rule, because at that stage the `"Hope is Dead"` rule is true.

.Rule "We have an honest politician"
[source]
----
rule "We have an honest Politician"
    salience 10
  when
    exists( Politician( honest == true ) )
  then
    insertLogical( new Hope() );
end
----

As soon as a `Hope` object exists, the `"Hope Lives"` rule matches and fires. This rule also has a `salience` value of `10` so that it takes priority over the `"Corrupt the Honest"` rule.

.Rule "Hope Lives"
[source]
----
rule "Hope Lives"
    salience 10
  when
    exists( Hope() )
  then
    System.out.println("Hurrah!!! Democracy Lives");
end
----

Initially, four honest politicians exist so this rule has four activations, all in conflict. Each rule fires in turn, corrupting each politician so that they are no longer honest. When all four politicians have been corrupted, no politicians have the property `honest == true`. The rule `"We have an honest Politician"` is no longer true and the object it logically inserted (due to the last execution of `new Hope()`) is automatically retracted.

.Rule "Corrupt the Honest"
[source]
----
rule "Corrupt the Honest"
  when
    politician : Politician( honest == true )
    exists( Hope() )
  then
    System.out.println( "I'm an evil corporation and I have corrupted " + politician.getName() );
    modify ( politician ) { honest = false };
end
----

With the `Hope` object automatically retracted through the truth maintenance system, the conditional element `not` applied to `Hope` is no longer true so that the `"Hope is Dead"` rule matches and fires.

.Rule "Hope is Dead"
[source]
----
rule "Hope is Dead"
  when
    not( Hope() )
  then
    System.out.println( "We are all Doomed!!! Democracy is Dead" );
end
----

== Example execution and audit trail

In the `HonestPoliticianExample.java` class, the four politicians with the honest state set to `true` are inserted for evaluation against the defined business rules:

.HonestPoliticianExample.java class execution
[source,java]
----
public static void execute( KieContainer kc ) {
        KieSession ksession = kc.newKieSession("HonestPoliticianKS");

        final Politician p1 = new Politician( "President of Umpa Lumpa", true );
        final Politician p2 = new Politician( "Prime Minster of Cheeseland", true );
        final Politician p3 = new Politician( "Tsar of Pringapopaloo", true );
        final Politician p4 = new Politician( "Omnipotence Om", true );

        ksession.insert( p1 );
        ksession.insert( p2 );
        ksession.insert( p3 );
        ksession.insert( p4 );

        ksession.fireAllRules();

        ksession.dispose();
    }
----

To execute the example, run the `org.drools.examples.honestpolitician.HonestPoliticianExample` class as a Java application in your IDE.

After the execution, the following output appears in the IDE console window:

.Execution output in the IDE console
[source]
----
Hurrah!!! Democracy Lives
I'm an evil corporation and I have corrupted President of Umpa Lumpa
I'm an evil corporation and I have corrupted Prime Minster of Cheeseland
I'm an evil corporation and I have corrupted Tsar of Pringapopaloo
I'm an evil corporation and I have corrupted Omnipotence Om
We are all Doomed!!! Democracy is Dead
----

The output shows that, while there is at least one honest politician, democracy lives. However, as each politician is corrupted by some corporation, all politicians become dishonest, and democracy is dead.

To better understand the execution flow of this example, you can modify the `HonestPoliticianExample.java` class to include a `DebugRuleRuntimeEventListener` listener and an audit logger to view execution details:

.HonestPoliticianExample.java class with an audit logger
[source,java]
----
package org.drools.examples.honestpolitician;

import org.kie.api.KieServices;
import org.kie.api.event.rule.DebugAgendaEventListener; <1>
import org.kie.api.event.rule.DebugRuleRuntimeEventListener;
import org.kie.api.runtime.KieContainer;
import org.kie.api.runtime.KieSession;

public class HonestPoliticianExample {

    /**
     * @param args
     */
    public static void main(final String[] args) {
    	KieServices ks = KieServices.Factory.get(); <2>
    	//ks = KieServices.Factory.get();
        KieContainer kc = KieServices.Factory.get().getKieClasspathContainer();
        System.out.println(kc.verify().getMessages().toString());
        //execute( kc );
        execute( ks, kc); <3>
    }

    public static void execute( KieServices ks, KieContainer kc ) { <4>
        KieSession ksession = kc.newKieSession("HonestPoliticianKS");

        final Politician p1 = new Politician( "President of Umpa Lumpa", true );
        final Politician p2 = new Politician( "Prime Minster of Cheeseland", true );
        final Politician p3 = new Politician( "Tsar of Pringapopaloo", true );
        final Politician p4 = new Politician( "Omnipotence Om", true );

        ksession.insert( p1 );
        ksession.insert( p2 );
        ksession.insert( p3 );
        ksession.insert( p4 );

        // The application can also setup listeners <5>
        ksession.addEventListener( new DebugAgendaEventListener() );
        ksession.addEventListener( new DebugRuleRuntimeEventListener() );

        // Set up a file-based audit logger.
        ks.getLoggers().newFileLogger( ksession, "./target/honestpolitician" ); <6>

        ksession.fireAllRules();

        ksession.dispose();
    }

}

<1> Adds to your imports the packages that handle the `DebugAgendaEventListener` and `DebugRuleRuntimeEventListener`
<2> Creates a `KieServices Factory` and a `ks` element to produce the logs because this audit log is not available at the `KieContainer` level
<3> Modifies the `execute` method to use both `KieServices` and `KieContainer`
<4> Modifies the `execute` method to pass in `KieServices` in addition to the `KieContainer`
<5> Creates the listeners
<6> Builds the log that can be passed into the debug view or *Audit View* or your IDE after executing of the rules

When you run the Honest Politician with this modified logging capability, you can load the audit log file from `target/honestpolitician.log` into your IDE debug view or *Audit View*, if available (for example, in *Window* -> *Show View* in some IDEs).

In this example, the *Audit View* shows the flow of executions, insertions, and retractions as defined in the example classes and rules:

.Honest Politician example Audit View
image::Examples/HonestPoliticianExample/honest_politician_audit.png[align="center"]

When the first politician is inserted, two activations occur. The rule `"We have an honest Politician"` is activated only one time for the first inserted politician because it uses an `exists` conditional element, which matches when at least one politician is inserted. The rule `"Hope is Dead"` is also activated at this stage because the `Hope` object is not yet inserted. The rule `"We have an honest Politician"` fires first because it has a higher `salience` value than the rule `"Hope is Dead"`, and inserts the `Hope` object (highlighted in green). The insertion of the `Hope` object activates the rule `"Hope Lives"` and deactivates the rule `"Hope is Dead"`. The insertion also activates the rule `"Corrupt the Honest"` for each inserted honest politician. The rule `"Hope Lives"` is executed and prints `"Hurrah!!! Democracy Lives"`.

Next, for each politician, the rule `"Corrupt the Honest"` fires, printing `"I'm an evil corporation and I have corrupted X"`, where `X` is the name of the politician, and modifies the politician honesty value to `false`. When the last honest politician is corrupted, `Hope` is automatically retracted by the truth maintenance system (highlighted in blue). The green highlighted area shows the origin of the currently selected blue highlighted area. After the `Hope` fact is retracted, the rule `"Hope is dead"` fires, printing `"We are all Doomed!!! Democracy is Dead"`.
