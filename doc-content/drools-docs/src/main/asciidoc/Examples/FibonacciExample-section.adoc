Objective: Demonstrates recursion and the use of salience

The Fibonacci Example demonstrates recursion and conflict resolution with salience values.

The Fibonacci Numbers (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) discovered by Leonardo of Pisa (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci) form a sequence starting with 0 and 1. The next Fibonacci number is obtained by adding the two preceding Fibonacci numbers. The first few elements of the Fibonacci sequence are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597, 2584, 4181, 6765, 10946,... 

The single fact class `Fibonacci` is used in this example.
It has two fields, sequence and value.
The sequence field is used to indicate the position of the object in the Fibonacci number sequence.
The value field shows the value of that Fibonacci object for that sequence position, using -1 to indicate a value that still needs to be computed.

    private long value;

    public Fibonacci( final int sequence ) {
        this.sequence = sequence;
        this.value = -1;
    }

To kick this off from Java you only need to insert a single Fibonacci object, with a sequence field of 50.
A recursive rule is then used to insert the other 49 `Fibonacci` objects.

Instead of implementing the ``PropertyChangeSupport`` interface this example uses the MVEL dialect `modify` keyword which allows a block setter action and also notifies the engine of changes.

.Fibonacci Example: Execution

[source,java]
----
ksession.insert( new Fibonacci( 50 ) );
ksession.fireAllRules();
----

There are three rules in this example: Recurse, Bootstrap and Calculate.

The rule Recurse is very simple. It matches each asserted `Fibonacci` object with a value of -1, creating and  asserting a new `Fibonacci` object with a sequence of one less than the currently matched object.
Each time a Fibonacci object is added while the one with a sequence field equal to 1 does not exist, the rule re-matches and fires again. The `not` conditional element is used to stop the rule's matching once you have all 50 Fibonacci objects in memory. The rule also has a salience value, because you need to have all 50 `Fibonacci` objects asserted before you execute the Bootstrap rule.

.Fibonacci Example: Rule "Recurse"

[source]
----
rule Recurse
    salience 10
    when
        f : Fibonacci ( value == -1 )
        not ( Fibonacci ( sequence == 1 ) )
    then
        insert( new Fibonacci( f.sequence - 1 ) );
        System.out.println( "recurse for " + f.sequence );
end
----



The Audit view shows the original assertion of the `Fibonacci` object with a sequence field of 50, done from Java code. From there on, the Audit view shows the continual recursion of the rule, where each asserted `Fibonacci` object causes the Recurse rule to become activated and to fire again.

When a `Fibonacci` object with a sequence field of 2 is asserted the "Bootstrap" rule is matched and activated along with the "Recurse" rule. Note the multiple restrictions on field ``sequence``, testing for equality with 1 or 2.

.Fibonacci Example: Rule "Bootstrap"

[source]
----
rule Bootstrap
    when
        f : Fibonacci( sequence == 1 || == 2, value == -1 ) // multi-restriction
    then 
        modify ( f ){ value = 1 };
        System.out.println( f.sequence + " == " + f.value );
end
----



At this point the Agenda looks as shown below. The "Bootstrap" rule does not fire yet because the "Recurse" rule has a higher salience.

When a `Fibonacci` object with a sequence of 1 is asserted the Bootstrap rule is matched again, causing two activations for this rule. Note that the "Recurse" rule does not match and activate because the `not` conditional element stops the rule's matching as soon as a `Fibonacci` object with a sequence of 1 exists.

The "Bootstrap" rule sets the objects with sequence 1 and 2 to values of 1.
Now that you have two `Fibonacci` objects with values not equal to -1 the "Calculate" rule is able to match.
At this point there are 50 Fibonacci objects in the Working Memory.
You need to select a suitable triple to calculate each of their values in turn.
Using three Fibonacci patterns in a rule without field constraints to confine the possible cross products would result in 50x49x48 possible combinations, leading to about 125,000 possible rule firings, most of them incorrect.
The "Calculate" rule uses field constraints to correctly force the thee Fibonacci patterns in the correct order; this technique is called __cross product matching__.
The first pattern finds any Fibonacci with a value != -1 and binds both the pattern and the field.
The second Fibonacci does this, too, but it adds an additional field constraint to ensure that its sequence is greater by one than the Fibonacci bound to ``f1``.
When this rule fires for the first time, you know that only sequences 1 and 2 have values of 1, and the two constraints ensure that `f1` references sequence 1 and `f2` references sequence 2.
The final pattern finds the Fibonacci with a value equal to -1 and with a sequence one greater than ``f2``.
At this point, there are three `Fibonacci` objects correctly selected from the available cross products, and you can calculate the value for the third `Fibonacci` object that's bound to ``f3``.

.Fibonacci Example: Rule "Calculate"

[source]
----
rule Calculate
    when
        // Bind f1 and s1
        f1 : Fibonacci( s1 : sequence, value != -1 )
        // Bind f2 and v2; refer to bound variable s1
        f2 : Fibonacci( sequence == (s1 + 1), v2 : value != -1 )
        // Bind f3 and s3; alternative reference of f2.sequence
        f3 : Fibonacci( s3 : sequence == (f2.sequence + 1 ), value == -1 )      
    then
        // Note the various referencing techniques.
        modify ( f3 ) { value = f1.value + v2 };
        System.out.println( s3 + " == " + f3.value );
end
----



The `modify` statement updates the value of the `Fibonacci` object bound to ``f3``.
This means that you now have another new Fibonacci object with a value not equal to -1, which allows the "Calculate" rule to rematch and calculate the next Fibonacci number.
The Audit view below shows how the firing of the last "Bootstrap" modifies the `Fibonacci` object, enabling the "Calculate" rule to match, which then modifies another Fibonacci object allowing the "Calculate" rule to match again.
This continues till the value is set for all `Fibonacci` objects.
