= Invaders


A simplifed version of the Space Invaders game.
Use the keys Z and K, to move left and right and M to fire a misile.
The example is built up over 6 projects, each adding slightly more complexity to the last.

== Invaders1Main


Invaders1Main creates the frame and attaches the KeyListener, feeding key events into the engine.
It also sets up the main game loop which can be found in "Main.drl".  The typical convention used through out the example is to have one agenda group per file, and all rules in that file in the same agenda group.

The Run fact is used to drive the repeat of the Game loop.
Initially there are only one groups that is evaluated, Keys.
The "keys.drl" file is shared by several examples, and illustrates rule re-use across multipel projects.

.Game Loop

rule "init" when
then
    insert( new Run() );
    setFocus( "Init" );
end

rule GameLoop when
    r : Run()
then
    setFocus( "Keys" );
end


rule Draw when
    r : Run()
then
    ui.show();
    modify( r ) {} // force loop
end

== Invaders2Main


Invaders2Main adds the "Draw" stage to the game loop and draws the SpaceShip

== Invaders3Main


Invaders3Main adds move controls to the spaceship, notice the ship moves out of the boundaries of the screen.
KeyPressed is detected and that sets a delta of dx on the ship direction.
That delta is then repeated applied to the x position of the ship

.Move Ship
====

rule ShipDeltaMoveLeft agenda-group "Move" when
    s : Ship()
        KeyPressed( keyText == "Z" )
then
    modify( s ) { dx = 0 - s.speed }
end

rule ShipDeltaStopLeft agenda-group "Move" when
    s : Ship()
        not KeyPressed( keyText == "Z" )
then
    modify( s ) { dx = 0 }
end

rule ShipMove agenda-group "Move" when
    s : Ship( dx != 0 )
    Run()
then
    modify( s ) { x = s.x + s.dx }
end
----
====

== Invaders4Main


Invaders4Main adds boundari control to the ShipMove rule, so it doesn't move off the screen.
Notice the use of "@watch( !x )", this ensures that while the rule wil modify the x property, it will not react to changes to x, which avoids recursion issues.

.Move Ship with Boundaries

rule ShipMove agenda-group "Move" when
    s : Ship( dx != 0, x + dx > 0,  x + dx + width < conf.windowWidth ) @watch( !x )
    Run()
then
    modify( s ) { x = s.x + s.dx }
end

== Invaders5Main


Invaders5Main updates the "Draw" group to draw 5 Invaders.

== Invaders6Main


Invaders6Main adds a lot more meat.
Pressing the "M" key fires a missile that travels up the screen, while moving collision between the missile and the invader is checked.

== Invaders4Main


Invaders4Main adds boundari control to the ShipMove rule, so it doesn't move off the screen.
Notice the use of "@watch( !x )", this ensures that while the rule wil modify the x property, it will not react to changes to x, which avoids recursion issues.

.Fire Missile

rule InsertBullet agenda-group "Bullet" when
        KeyPressed( keyText == "M" )
    s : Ship()
    not Bullet()
then
    b = new Bullet();
    b.x = s.x + (s.width/2) - (b.width/2);
    b.y = s.y - s.height - b.height;
    b.width = conf.bulletWidth;
    b.height = conf.bulletHeight;
    b.dy = 0 - conf.bulletSpeed;
    insert( b );
end


rule BulletMove agenda-group "Bullet" when
    b : Bullet( y > 0 ) @watch( !y )
    Run()
then
    modify( b ) { y = b.y + b.dy }
end

rule Collision agenda-group "Bullet" when
    b : Bullet( ) @watch( y )
    i : Invader( x < b.x, x + width > b.x, y > b.y)
    Run()
then
    modify( i ) { alive = false }
end
