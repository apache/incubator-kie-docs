= Accessing example projects and business assets in {CENTRAL}

You can use the example projects in {CENTRAL} to explore example business assets as a reference for the rules or other assets that you create in your own {PRODUCT} projects.

.Prerequisites
* {CENTRAL} is installed and running. For installation options, see {URL_PLANNING_INSTALL}[_{PLANNING_INSTALL}_].

.Procedure
. In {CENTRAL}, go to *Menu* -> *Design* -> *Projects* and click *Try Samples*.
+
If a project already exists, click the three vertical dots in the upper-right corner of the *Projects* page and click *Try Samples*.
. Review the descriptions for each sample project to determine which project you want to explore. Each sample project is designed differently to demonstrate

ifdef::PAM,JBPM[]
process automation, decision management, or business optimization

assets and logic in {PRODUCT}.
. Select one or more sample projects and click *Ok* to add the projects to your space.
. In the *Projects* page of your space, select one of the new example projects to view the example assets for that project.
. Select each example asset to explore how the project is designed to achieve the specified goal or workflow.
. In the upper-right corner of the project *Assets* page, click *Build* to compile the sample project or *Deploy* to compile the project and then deploy it to {KIE_SERVER}.

[NOTE]
====
For development purposes, you can select the *Build and Install* option to compile the project and publish the KJAR file to the configured Maven repository without deploying to a {KIE_SERVER}. This option is equivalent to running `mvn clean install` for your project in the command terminal. You can also click *Deploy* to deploy the compiled KJAR file to a {KIE_SERVER} without aborting any running instances (if applicable), or click *Redeploy* to deploy the compiled KJAR file and abort any running instances.

To enable development mode in {CENTRAL}, go to project *Settings* -> *General Settings* -> *Version* and toggle the *Development Mode* option. Do not use *Development Mode* or manually add the `SNAPSHOT` version suffix for a production environment.
====

To review project deployment details (if applicable), go to *Menu* -> *Deploy* -> *Execution Servers*.
