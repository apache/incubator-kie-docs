= Accessing sample projects and business assets in {CENTRAL}

You can use the sample projects in {CENTRAL} to explore business assets as a reference for the rules or other assets that you create in your own {PRODUCT} projects.

.Prerequisites
* {CENTRAL} is installed and running. For installation options, see {URL_INSTALLING_AND_CONFIGURING}#assembly-planning[_{PLANNING_INSTALL}_].

.Procedure
. In {CENTRAL}, go to *Menu* -> *Design* -> *Projects*. If there are existing projects, you can access the samples by clicking the *MySpace* default space and selecting *Try Samples* from the *Add Project* drop-down menu. If there are no existing projects, click *Try samples*.

. Review the descriptions for each sample project to determine which project you want to explore. Each sample project is designed differently to demonstrate

decision management or business optimization

ifdef::PAM,JBPM[]
process automation, decision management, or business optimization
endif::[]
assets and logic in {PRODUCT}.
. Select one or more sample projects and click *Ok* to add the projects to your space.
. In the *Projects* page of your space, select one of the sample projects to view the assets for that project.
. Select each asset to explore how the project is designed to achieve the specified goal or workflow. Some of the sample projects contain more than one page of assets. Click the left or right arrows in the upper-right corner to view the full asset list.

[NOTE]
====
You can also select the *Build & Install* option to build the project and publish the KJAR file to the configured Maven repository without deploying to a {KIE_SERVER}. In a development environment, you can click *Deploy* to deploy the built KJAR file to a {KIE_SERVER} without stopping any running instances (if applicable), or click *Redeploy* to deploy the built KJAR file and replace all instances. The next time you deploy or redeploy the built KJAR, the previous deployment unit (KIE container) is automatically updated in the same target {KIE_SERVER}. In a production environment, the *Redeploy* option is disabled and you can click *Deploy* only to deploy the built KJAR file to a new deployment unit (KIE container) on a {KIE_SERVER}.

To configure the {KIE_SERVER} environment mode, set the `org.kie.server.mode` system property to `org.kie.server.mode=development` or `org.kie.server.mode=production`. To configure the deployment behavior for a corresponding project in {CENTRAL}, go to project *Settings* -> *General Settings* -> *Version*, toggle the *Development Mode* option, and click *Save*. By default, {KIE_SERVER} and all new projects in {CENTRAL} are in development mode. You cannot deploy a project with *Development Mode* turned on or with a manually added `SNAPSHOT` version suffix to a {KIE_SERVER} that is in production mode.
====

To review project deployment details, click *View deployment details* in the deployment banner at the top of the screen or in the *Deploy* drop-down menu. This option directs you to the *Menu* -> *Deploy* -> *Execution Servers* page.
