= House of Doom example decisions (backward chaining and recursion)

The House of Doom example decision set demonstrates how the {DECISION_ENGINE} uses backward chaining and recursion to reach defined goals or subgoals in a hierarchical system.

The following is an overview of the House of Doom example:

* *Name*: `backwardchaining`
* *Main class*: `org.drools.examples.backwardchaining.HouseOfDoomMain` (in `src/main/java`)
* *Module*: `drools-examples`
* *Type*: Java application
* *Rule file*: `org.drools.examples.backwardchaining.BC-Example.drl` (in `src/main/resources`)
* *Objective*: Demonstrates backward chaining and recursion

A backward-chaining rule system is a goal-driven system that starts with a conclusion that the {DECISION_ENGINE} attempts to satisfy, often using recursion. If the system cannot reach the conclusion or goal, it searches for subgoals, which are conclusions that complete part of the current goal. The system continues this process until either the initial conclusion is satisfied or all subgoals are satisfied.

In contrast, a forward-chaining rule system is a data-driven system that starts with a fact in the working memory of the {DECISION_ENGINE} and reacts to changes to that fact. When objects are inserted into working memory, any rule conditions that become true as a result of the change are scheduled for execution by the agenda.

The {DECISION_ENGINE} in {PRODUCT} uses both forward and backward chaining to evaluate rules.

The following diagram illustrates how the {DECISION_ENGINE} evaluates rules using forward chaining overall with a backward-chaining segment in the logic flow:

The House of Doom example uses rules with various types of queries to find the location of rooms and items within the house. The sample class `Location.java` contains the `item` and `location` elements used in the example. The sample class `HouseOfDoomMain.java` inserts the items or rooms in their respective locations in the house and executes the rules.

All rules in the example have fired to detect the location of all items in the house and to print the location of each in the output.

== Recursive query and related rules

A recursive query repeatedly searches through the hierarchy of a data structure for relationships between elements.

In the House of Doom example, the `BC-Example.drl` file contains an `isContainedIn` query that most of the rules in the example use to recursively evaluate the house data structure for data inserted into the {DECISION_ENGINE}:

.Recursive query in BC-Example.drl
[source]
----
query isContainedIn( String x, String y )
  Location( x, y; )
  or
  ( Location( z, y; ) and isContainedIn( x, z; ) )
end
----

The rule `"go"` prints every string inserted into the system to determine how items are implemented, and the rule `"go1"` calls the query `isContainedIn`:

.Rules "go" and "go1"
[source]
----
rule "go" salience 10
  when
    $s : String( )
  then
    System.out.println( $s );
end

rule "go1"
  when
    String( this == "go1" )
    isContainedIn("Office", "House"; )
  then
    System.out.println( "Office is in the House" );
end
----

The example inserts the `"go1"` string into the {DECISION_ENGINE} and activates the `"go1"` rule to detect that item `Office` is in the location `House`:

.Insert string and fire rules
[source]
----
ksession.insert( "go1" );
ksession.fireAllRules();
----

.Rule "go1" output in the IDE console
[source]
----
go1
Office is in the House
----

[discrete]
== Transitive closure rule

Transitive closure is a relationship between an element contained in a parent element that is multiple levels higher in a hierarchical structure.

The rule `"go2"` identifies the transitive closure relationship of the `Drawer` and the `House`: The `Drawer` is in the `Desk` in the `Office` in the `House`.

[source]
----
rule "go2"
  when
    String( this == "go2" )
    isContainedIn("Drawer", "House"; )
  then
    System.out.println( "Drawer is in the House" );
end
----

The example inserts the `"go2"` string into the {DECISION_ENGINE} and activates the `"go2"` rule to detect that item `Drawer` is ultimately within the location `House`:

.Insert string and fire rules
[source]
----
ksession.insert( "go2" );
ksession.fireAllRules();
----

.Rule "go2" output in the IDE console
[source]
----
go2
Drawer is in the House
----

The {DECISION_ENGINE} determines this outcome based on the following logic:

. The query recursively searches through several levels in the house to detect the transitive closure between `Drawer` and `House`.
. Instead of using `Location( x, y; )`, the query uses the value of `(z, y; )` because `Drawer` is not directly in `House`.
. The `z` argument is currently unbound, which means it has no value and returns everything that is in the argument.
. The `y` argument is currently bound to `House`, so `z` returns `Office` and `Kitchen`.
. The query gathers information from the `Office` and checks recursively if the `Drawer` is in the `Office`. The query line `isContainedIn( x, z; )` is called for these parameters.
. No instance of `Drawer` exists directly in `Office`, so no match is found.
. With `z` unbound, the query returns data within the `Office` and determines that *z == Desk*.
+
[source]
----
isContainedIn(x==drawer, z==desk)
----
. The `isContainedIn` query recursively searches three times, and on the third time, the query detects an instance of `Drawer` in `Desk`.
+
[source]
----
Location(x==drawer, y==desk)
----
. After this match on the first location, the query recursively searches back up the structure to determine that the `Drawer` is in the `Desk`, the `Desk` is in the `Office`, and the `Office` is in the `House`. Therefore, the `Drawer` is in the `House` and the rule is satisfied.

[discrete]
== Reactive query rule

A reactive query searches through the hierarchy of a data structure for relationships between elements and is dynamically updated when elements in the structure are modified.

The rule `"go3"` functions as a reactive query that detects if a new item `Key` ever becomes present in the `Office` by transitive closure: A `Key` in the `Drawer` in the `Office`.

.Rule "go3"
[source]
----
rule "go3"
  when
    String( this == "go3" )
    isContainedIn("Key", "Office"; )
  then
    System.out.println( "Key is in the Office" );
end
----

The example inserts the `"go3"` string into the {DECISION_ENGINE} and activates the `"go3"` rule. Initially, this rule is not satisfied because no item `Key` exists in the house structure, so the rule produces no output.

.Insert string and fire rules
[source]
----
ksession.insert( "go3" );
ksession.fireAllRules();
----

.Rule "go3" output in the IDE console (unsatisfied)
[source]
----
go3
----

The example then inserts a new item `Key` in the location `Drawer`, which is in `Office`. This change satisfies the transitive closure in the `"go3"` rule and the output is populated accordingly.

.Insert new item location and fire rules
[source]
----
ksession.insert( new Location("Key", "Drawer") );
ksession.fireAllRules();
----

.Rule "go3" output in the IDE console (satisfied)
[source]
----
Key is in the Office
----

This change also adds another level in the structure that the query includes in subsequent recursive searches.

[discrete]
== Queries with unbound arguments in rules

A query with one or more unbound arguments returns all undefined (unbound) items within a defined (bound) argument of the query. If all arguments in a query are unbound, then the query returns all items within the scope of the query.

The rule `"go4"` uses an unbound argument `thing` to search for all items within the bound argument `Office`, instead of using a bound argument to search for a specific item in the `Office`:

.Rule "go4"
[source]
----
rule "go4"
  when
    String( this == "go4" )
    isContainedIn(thing, "Office"; )
  then
    System.out.println( thing + "is in the Office" );
end
----

The example inserts the `"go4"` string into the {DECISION_ENGINE} and activates the `"go4"` rule to return all items in the `Office`:

.Insert string and fire rules
[source]
----
ksession.insert( "go4" );
ksession.fireAllRules();
----

.Rule "go4" output in the IDE console
[source]
----
go4
Chair is in the Office
Desk is in the Office
Key is in the Office
Computer is in the Office
Drawer is in the Office
----

The rule `"go5"` uses both unbound arguments `thing` and `location` to search for all items and their locations in the entire `House` data structure:

.Rule "go5"
[source]
----
rule "go5"
  when
    String( this == "go5" )
    isContainedIn(thing, location; )
  then
    System.out.println(thing + " is in " + location );
end
----

The example inserts the `"go5"` string into the {DECISION_ENGINE} and activates the `"go5"` rule to return all items and their locations in the `House` data structure:

.Insert string and fire rules
[source]
----
ksession.insert( "go5" );
ksession.fireAllRules();
----

.Rule "go5" output in the IDE console
[source]
----
