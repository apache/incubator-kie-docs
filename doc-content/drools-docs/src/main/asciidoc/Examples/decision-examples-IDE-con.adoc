= Example decisions in {PRODUCT} for an IDE

{PRODUCT} provides example decisions distributed as Java classes that you can import into your integrated development environment (IDE). You can use these examples to better understand {DECISION_ENGINE} capabilities or use them as a reference for the decisions that you define in your own {PRODUCT} projects.

The following example decision sets are some of the examples available in {PRODUCT}:

* *Hello World example*: Demonstrates basic rule execution and use of debug output
* *State example*: Demonstrates forward chaining and conflict resolution through rule salience and agenda groups
* *Fibonacci example*: Demonstrates recursion and conflict resolution through rule salience
* *Banking example*: Demonstrates pattern matching, basic sorting, and calculation
* *Pet Store example*: Demonstrates rule agenda groups, global variables, callbacks, and GUI integration
* *Sudoku example*: Demonstrates complex pattern matching, problem solving, callbacks, and GUI integration
* *House of Doom example*: Demonstrates backward chaining and recursion
