= Traits


WARNING : this feature is still experimental and subject to changes

The same fact may have multiple dynamic types which do not fit naturally in a class hierarchy.
Traits allow to model this very common scenario.
A trait is an interface that can be applied (and eventually removed) to an individual object at runtime.
To create a trait rather than a traditional bean, one has to declare them explicitly as in the following example:

[source]
----
declare trait GoldenCustomer
    // fields will map to getters/setters
    code     : String
    balance  : long
    discount : int
    maxExpense : long
end
----


At runtime, this declaration results in an interface, which can be used to write patterns, but can not be instantiated directly.
In order to apply a trait to an object, we provide the new don keyword, which can be used as simply as this:

[source]
----
when
    $c : Customer()
then
    GoldenCustomer gc = don( $c, GoldenCustomer.class );
end
----


when a core object dons a trait, a proxy class is created on the fly (one such class will be generated lazily for each core/trait class combination). The proxy instance, which wraps the core object and implements the trait interface, is inserted automatically and will possibly activate other rules.
An immediate advantage of declaring and using interfaces, getting the implementation proxy for free from the {DECISION_ENGINE}, is that multiple inheritance hierarchies can be exploited when writing rules.
The core classes, however, need not implement any of those interfaces statically, also facilitating the use of legacy classes as cores.
In fact, any object can don a trait, provided that they are declared as @Traitable.
Notice that this annotation used to be optional, but now is mandatory.

[source]
----
import org.drools.core.factmodel.traits.Traitable;
declare Customer
    @Traitable
    code    : String
    balance : long
end
----


The only connection between core classes and trait interfaces is at the proxy level: a trait is not specifically tied to a core class.
This means that the same trait can be applied to totally different objects.
For this reason, the trait does not transparently expose the fields of its core object.
So, when writing a rule using a trait interface, only the fields of the interface will be available, as usual.
However, any field in the interface that corresponds to a core object field, will be mapped by the proxy class:

[source]
----
when
    $o: OrderItem( $p : price, $code : custCode )
    $c: GoldenCustomer( code == $code, $a : balance, $d: discount )
then
    $c.setBalance( $a - $p*$d );
end
----


In this case, the code and balance would be read from the underlying Customer object.
Likewise, the setAccount will modify the underlying object, preserving a strongly typed access to the data structures.
A hard field must have the same name and type both in the core class and all donned interfaces.
The name is used to establish the mapping: if two fields have the same name, then they must also have the same declared type.
The annotation @org.drools.core.factmodel.traits.Alias allows to relax this restriction.
If an @Alias is provided, its value string will be used to resolve mappings instead of the original field name.
@Alias can be applied both to traits and core beans. 

[source]
----
import org.drools.core.factmodel.traits.*;
declare trait GoldenCustomer
    balance : long @Alias( "org.acme.foo.accountBalance" )
end

declare Person
    @Traitable
    name : String
    savings : long @Alias( "org.acme.foo.accountBalance" )
end

when
    GoldenCustomer( balance &gt; 1000 ) // will react to new Person( 2000 )
then
end
----

More work is being done on relaxing this constraint (see the experimental section on "logical" traits later). Now, one might wonder what happens when a core class does NOT provide the implementation for a field defined in an interface.
We call hard fields those trait fields which are also core fields and thus readily available, while we define soft those fields which are NOT provided by the core class.
Hidden fields, instead, are fields in the core class not exposed by the interface.

So, while hard field management is intuitive, there remains the problem of soft and hidden fields.
Hidden fields are normally only accessible using the core class directly.
However, the "fields" Map can be used on a trait interface to access a hidden field.
If the field can't be resolved, null will be returned.
Notice that this feature is likely to change in the future.

[source]
----
when
    $sc : GoldenCustomer( fields[ "age" ] > 18 )  // age is declared by the underlying core class, but not by GoldenCustomer
then
----


Soft fields, instead, are stored in a Map-like data structure that is specific to each core object and referenced by the proxy(es), so that they are effectively shared even when an object dons multiple traits.

[source]
----
when
    $sc : GoldenCustomer( $c : code, // hard getter
                          $maxExpense : maxExpense > 1000 // soft getter
    )
then
    $sc.setDiscount( ... ); // soft setter
end
----


A core object also holds a reference to all its proxies, so that it is possible to track which type(s) have been added to an object, using a sort of dynamic "instanceof" operator, which we called isA.
The operator can accept a String, a class literal or a list of class literals.
In the latter case, the constraint is satisfied only if all the traits have been donned. 

[source]
----
$sc : GoldenCustomer( $maxExpense : maxExpense > 1000,
                      this isA "SeniorCustomer", this isA [ NationalCustomer.class, OnlineCustomer.class ]
)
----

Eventually, the business logic may require that a trait is removed from a wrapped object.
To this end, we provide two options.
The first is a "logical don", which will result in a logical insertion of the proxy resulting from the traiting operation.
The TMS will ensure that the trait is removed when its logical support is removed in the first place.

[source]
----
then
    don( $x, // core object
         Customer.class, // trait class
         true // optional flag for logical insertion
    )
----


The second is the use of the "shed" keyword, which causes the removal of any type that is a subtype (or equivalent) of the one passed as an argument.
Notice that, as of version 5.5, shed would only allow to remove a single specific trait.

[source]
----
then
    Thing t = shed( $x, GoldenCustomer.class ) // also removes any trait that
----


This operation returns another proxy implementing the org.drools.core.factmodel.traits.Thing interface, where the getFields() and getCore() methods are defined.
Internally, in fact, all declared traits are generated to extend this interface (in addition to any others specified).      This allows to preserve the wrapper with the soft fields which would otherwise be lost.

A trait and its proxies are also correlated in another way.
Starting from version 5.6, whenever a core object is "modified", its proxies are "modified" automatically as well, to allow trait-based patterns to react to potential changes in hard fields.
Likewise, whenever a trait proxy (matched by a trait pattern) is modified, the modification is propagated to the core class and the other traits.
Moreover, whenever a don operation is performed, the core object is also modified automatically, to reevaluate any "isA" operation which may be triggered.

Potentially, this may result in a high number of modifications, impacting performance (and correctness) heavily.
So two solutions are currently implemented.
First, whenever a core object is modified, only the most specific traits (in the sense of inheritance between trait interfaces) are updated and an internal blocking mechanism is in place to ensure that each potentially matching pattern is evaluated once and only once.
So, in the following situation:

[source]
----
declare trait GoldenCustomer end
declare trait NationalGoldenCustomer extends GoldenCustomer end
declare trait SeniorGoldenCustomer extends GoldenCustomer end
----


a modification of an object that is both a GoldenCustomer, a NationalGoldenCustomer and a SeniorGoldenCustomer wold cause only the latter two proxies to be actually modified.
The first would match any pattern for GoldenCustomer and NationalGoldenCustomer; the latter would instead be prevented from rematching GoldenCustomer, but would be allowed to match SeniorGoldenCustomer patterns.
It is not necessary, instead, to modify the GoldenCustomer proxy since it is already covered by at least one other more specific trait.

The second method, up to the user, is to mark traits as @PropertyReactive.
Property reactivity is trait-enabled and takes into account the trait field mappings, so to block unnecessary propagations. 

== Cascading traits

*WARNING* : This feature is extremely experimental and subject to changes

Normally, a hard field must be exposed with its original type by all traits donned by an object, to prevent situations such as

[source]
----
declare Person
  @Traitable
  name : String
  id : String
end

declare trait Customer
  id : String
end

declare trait Patient
  id : long  // Person can't don Patient, or an exception will be thrown
end
----


Should a Person don both Customer and Patient, the type of the hard field id would be ambiguous.
However, consider the following example, where GoldenCustomers refer their best friends so that they become Customers as well:

[source]
----
declare Person
  @Traitable( logical=true )
  bestFriend : Person
end

declare trait Customer end
        
declare trait GoldenCustomer extends Customer
  refers : Customer @Alias( "bestFriend" )
end
----


Aside from the @Alias, a Person-as-GoldenCustomer's best friend might be compatible with the requirements of the trait GoldenCustomer, provided that they are some kind of Customer themselves.
Marking a Person as "logically traitable" - i.e.
adding the annotation @Traitable( logical = true ) - will instruct the {DECISION_ENGINE} to try and preserve the logical consistency rather than throwing an exception due to a hard field with different type declarations (Person vs Customer). The following operations would then work:

[source,java]
----
Person p1 = new Person();
Person p2 = new Person();
p1.setBestFriend( p2 );
...
Customer c2 = don( p2, Customer.class );
...
GoldenCustomer gc1 = don( p1, GoldenCustomer.class );
...
p1.getBestFriend(); // returns p2
gc1.getRefers(); // returns c2, a Customer proxy wrapping p2
----


Notice that, by the time p1 becomes GoldenCustomer, p2 must have already become a Customer themselves, otherwise a runtime exception will be thrown since the very definition of GoldenCustomer would have been violated.

In some cases, however, one might want to infer, rather than verify, that p2 is a Customer by virtue that p1 is a GoldenCustomer.
This modality can be enabled by marking Customer as "logical", using the annotation @org.drools.core.factmodel.traits.Trait( logical = true ). In this case, should p2 not be a Customer by the time that p1 becomes a GoldenCustomer, it will be automatically don the trait Customer to preserve the logical integrity of the system.

Notice that the annotation on the core class enables the dynamic type management for its fields, whereas the annotation on the traits determines whether they will be enforced as integrity constraints or cascaded dynamically.

[source]
----
import org.drools.factmodel.traits.*;

declare trait Customer
    @Trait( logical = true )
end
