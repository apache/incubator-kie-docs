= Cloud Mode


The CLOUD processing mode is the default processing mode.
Users of rules engines are familiar with this mode because it behaves in exactly the same way as any pure forward chaining rules engine, including previous versions of Drools.

When running in CLOUD mode, the {DECISION_ENGINE} sees all facts in the working memory, does not matter if they are regular facts or events, as a whole.
There is no notion of flow of time, although events have a timestamp as usual.
In other words, although the {DECISION_ENGINE} knows that a given event was created, for instance, on January 1st 2009, at 09:35:40.767, it is not possible for the {DECISION_ENGINE} to determine how "old" the event is, because there is no concept of "now".

In this mode, the {DECISION_ENGINE} will apply its usual many-to-many pattern matching algorithm, using the rules constraints to find the matching tuples, activate and fire rules as usual.

This mode does not impose any kind of additional requirements on facts.
So for instance:

* There is no notion of time. No requirements clock synchronization.
* There is no requirement on event ordering. The {DECISION_ENGINE} looks at the events as an unordered cloud against which the {DECISION_ENGINE} tries to match rules.


On the other hand, since there is no requirements, some benefits are not available either.
For instance, in CLOUD mode, it is not possible to use sliding windows, because sliding windows are based on the concept of "now" and there is no concept of "now" in CLOUD mode.

Since there is no ordering requirement on events, it is not possible for the {DECISION_ENGINE} to determine when events can no longer match and as so, there is no automatic life-cycle management for events.
I.e., the application must explicitly delete events when they are no longer necessary, in the same way the application does with regular facts.

Cloud mode is the default execution mode for Drools, but in any case, as any other configuration in Drools, it is possible to change this behavior either by setting a system property, using configuration property files or using the API.
The corresponding property is:

[source,java]
----
KieBaseConfiguration config = KieServices.Factory.get().newKieBaseConfiguration();
config.setOption( EventProcessingOption.CLOUD );
----


The equivalent property is:

[source]
----
drools.eventProcessingMode = cloud
----
