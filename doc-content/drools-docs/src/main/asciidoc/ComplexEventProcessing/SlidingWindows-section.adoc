= Sliding Windows


Sliding Windows are a way to scope the events of interest by defining a window that is constantly moving.
The two most common types of sliding window implementations are time based windows and length based windows.

The next sections will detail each of them.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Sliding Windows are only available when running the {DECISION_ENGINE} in STREAM mode.
Check the Event Processing Mode section for details on how the STREAM mode works.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Sliding windows start to match immediately and defining a sliding window does not imply that the rule has to wait for the sliding window to be "full" in order to match.
For instance, a rule that calculates the average of an event property on a window:length(10) will start calculating the average immediately, and it will start at 0 (zero) for no-events, and will update the average as events arrive one by one.
