= Memory Management for Events

[IMPORTANT]
====
The automatic memory management for events is only performed when running the {DECISION_ENGINE} in STREAM mode.
Check the Event Processing Mode section for details on how the STREAM mode works.
====


One of the benefits of running the {DECISION_ENGINE} in STREAM mode is that the {DECISION_ENGINE} can detect when an event can no longer match any rule due to its temporal constraints.
When that happens, the {DECISION_ENGINE} can safely delete the event from the session without side effects and release any resources used by that event.

There are basically 2 ways for the {DECISION_ENGINE} to calculate the matching window for a given event:

* explicitly, using the expiration policy
* implicitly, analyzing the temporal constraints on events
