= Other rule action methods from `drools` and `kcontext` variables

In addition to the standard rule action methods, the {DECISION_ENGINE} supports methods in conjunction with the predefined `drools` and `kcontext` variables that you can also use in rule actions.

You can use the `drools` variable to call methods from the `KnowledgeHelper` class in your {PRODUCT} distribution, which is also the class that the standard rule action methods are based on. For all `drools` rule action options,

download the *{PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION_LONG} Source Distribution* ZIP file from the https://access.redhat.com/jbossnetwork/restricted/listSoftware.html[Red Hat Customer Portal] and navigate to `~/{PRODUCT_FILE}-sources/src/drools-$VERSION/drools-core/src/main/java/org/drools/core/spi/KnowledgeHelper.java`.

endif::[]

The following examples are common methods that you can use with the `drools` variable:

* `drools.halt()`: Terminates rule execution if a user or application has previously called `fireUntilHalt()`. When a user or application calls `fireUntilHalt()`, the {DECISION_ENGINE} starts in _active mode_ and evaluates rules continually until the user or application explicitly calls `halt()`. Otherwise, by default, the {DECISION_ENGINE} runs in _passive mode_ and evaluates rules only when a user or an application explicitly calls `fireAllRules()`.
* `drools.getWorkingMemory()`: Returns the `WorkingMemory` object.
* `drools.setFocus( "<agenda_group>" )`: Sets the focus to a specified agenda group to which the rule belongs.
* `drools.getRule().getName()`: Returns the name of the rule.
* `drools.getTuple()`, `drools.getActivation()`: Returns the `Tuple` that matches the currently executing rule and then delivers the corresponding `Activation`. These calls are useful for logging and debugging purposes.

You can use the `kcontext` variable with the `getKieRuntime()` method to call other methods from the `KieContext` class and, by extension, the `RuleContext` class in your {PRODUCT} distribution. The full Knowledge Runtime API is exposed through the `kcontext` variable and provides extensive rule action methods. For all `kcontext` rule action options,
ifdef::DM,PAM[]
download the *{PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION_LONG} Source Distribution* ZIP file from the https://access.redhat.com/jbossnetwork/restricted/listSoftware.html[Red Hat Customer Portal] and navigate to `~/{PRODUCT_FILE}-sources/src/kie-api-parent-$VERSION/kie-api/src/main/java/org/kie/api/runtime/rule/RuleContext.java`.

The following examples are common methods that you can use with the `kcontext.getKieRuntime()` variable-method combination:

* `kcontext.getKieRuntime().halt()`: Terminates rule execution if a user or application has previously called `fireUntilHalt()`. This method is equivalent to the `drools.halt()` method. When a user or application calls `fireUntilHalt()`, the {DECISION_ENGINE} starts in _active mode_ and evaluates rules continually until the user or application explicitly calls `halt()`. Otherwise, by default, the {DECISION_ENGINE} runs in _passive mode_ and evaluates rules only when a user or an application explicitly calls `fireAllRules()`.
* `kcontext.getKieRuntime().getAgenda()`: Returns a reference to the KIE session `Agenda`, and in turn provides access to rule activation groups, rule agenda groups, and ruleflow groups.

.Example call to access agenda group "CleanUp" and set the focus
[source,java]
----
kcontext.getKieRuntime().getAgenda().getAgendaGroup( "CleanUp" ).setFocus();
----
+
This example is equivalent to `drools.setFocus( "CleanUp" )`.
* `kcontext.getKieRuntime().getQueryResults(<string> query)`: Runs a query and returns the results. This method is equivalent to `drools.getKieRuntime().getQueryResults()`.
* `kcontext.getKieRuntime().getKieBase()`: Returns the `KieBase` object. The KIE base is the source of all the knowledge in your rule system and the originator of the current KIE session.
* `kcontext.getKieRuntime().setGlobal()`, `~.getGlobal()`, `~.getGlobals()`: Sets or retrieves global variables.
* `kcontext.getKieRuntime().getEnvironment()`: Returns the runtime `Environment`, similar to your operating system environment.
