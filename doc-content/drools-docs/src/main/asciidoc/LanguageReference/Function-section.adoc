Functions are a way to put semantic code in your rule source file, as opposed to in normal Java classes.
They can't do anything more than what you can do with helper classes.
(In fact, the compiler generates the helper class for you behind the scenes.) The main advantage of using functions in a rule is that you can keep the logic all in one place, and you can change the functions as needed (which can be a good or a bad thing). Functions are most useful for invoking actions on the consequence (``then``) part of a rule, especially if that particular action is used over and over again, perhaps with only differing parameters for each rule.

A typical function declaration looks like:

[source]
----
function String hello(String name) {
    return "Hello "+name+"!";
}
----


Note that the `function` keyword is used, even though its not really part of Java.
Parameters to the function are defined as for a method, and you don't have to have parameters if they are not needed.
The return type is defined just like in a regular method.

Alternatively, you could use a static method in a helper class, e.g., ``Foo.hello()``.
Drools supports the use of function imports, so all you would need to do is:

[source]
----
import function my.package.Foo.hello
----


Irrespective of the way the function is defined or imported, you use a function by calling it by its name, in the consequence or inside a semantic code block.
Example:

[source]
----
rule "using a static function"
when 
    eval( true )
then
    System.out.println( hello( "Bob" ) );
end
----
