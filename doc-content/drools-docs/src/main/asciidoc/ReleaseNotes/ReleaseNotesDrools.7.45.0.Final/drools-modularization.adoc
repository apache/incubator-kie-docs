== Modularization of drools core engine

In order to make the core engine of drools lighter and more maintainable there is an ongoing refactoring process to isolate
and descope optional features that are not related to the internal algorithm of the engine. This process started with version
7.40 with the descoping of traits and continued in this release with a similar approach to isolate in separated modules both the
features of the engine requiring mvel/asm and the ones involving protobuf based serialization.

=== Descope of MVEL and ASM based features

Historically {DECISION_ENGINE} leverages MVEL for a lot of internal usages like drl parsing, constraints evaluation, and templates generation.
Similarly ASM has been used for bytecode generation of declared types, traits and compiled contraints. The introduction of the
executable model provided an alternative (and under many points of view better) way to cover all these needs and then these 2
tools are no longer strictly required.

Therefore, {DECISION_ENGINE} usages of MVEL and ASM are isolated in a new `drools-mvel` module. This new module is strictly required on the
classpath for all usages that do not involve the executable model. Note that this is not related to the dialect in use. In the usual DRL
compilation, both Java and MVEL dialects rely on MVEL for parsing and on ASM for bytecode generation. In both cases, it is a must to
have `drools-mvel` in your classpath.

=== Descope of protobuf based serialization features

{DECISION_ENGINE} implements `KieSessions` serialization with protobuf to ensure better backward compatibility compared to the
serialization mechanism natively offered by Java. However, in the majority of use cases `KieSessions` serialization is not required
and it is not correct that this serialization feature is mixed with the core internal algorithms of the engine. Therefore, the
serialization feature is isolated in the new `drools-serialization-protobuf` module. `drools-serialization-protobuf`reflects
the fact that {DECISION_ENGINE} can provide a different implementation for `KieSessions` serialization that is based on different technologies.

=== New wrapper modules

The introduction of these new modules will very likely break the biggest part of existing projects using {DECISION_ENGINE}. The trivial fix
for these situations will be adding to the project's classpath `drools-mvel` and/or `drools-serialization-protobuf` according to
the project's requirements.

This issue is mainly caused by the fact that users have among their dependencies modules like `drools-core` and `drools-compiler`
that in reality are no more than "internal implementation details". To avoid similar problems in future, in the very likely case
that other modules will be introduced to split engine in finer grained submodules and descope optional features, the following 2
new wrapper modules have been created to cover the 2 different main usage scenarios:

* *drools-engine* aggregating `drools-core`, `drools-compiler` and `drools-model-compiler`
* *drools-engine-classic* aggregating `drools-core`, `drools-compiler` and `drools-mvel`

With the introduction of these 2 modules, to use {DECISION_ENGINE} with the executable model it will be enough to add `drools-engine` to a
project's dependencies while for traditional use of {DECISION_ENGINE} without the model it will be necessary to just import `drools-engine-classic`.
These names reflect the intention of the Drools team to promote the use of the executable model and make it the default choice.

=== Descope of Alpha Network Compiler

The Alpha Network Compiler feature has also been moved to a separated module.

To use it, you need
* to add the `drools-alphanetwork-compiler` module
* to enable it in the kmodule.xml to `inmemory` compilation

OR
* if you use the kie-maven-plugin, you can create an ANC compiled version with the `-DgenerateModel=WITHANC` option
