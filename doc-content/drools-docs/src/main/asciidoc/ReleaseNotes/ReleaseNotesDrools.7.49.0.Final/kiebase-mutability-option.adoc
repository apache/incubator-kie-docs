= New `KieBaseMutabilityOption`

By default, a `KieBase` at runtime can be updated dynamically and incrementally with all the running `KieSessions` that are created from the `KieBase`.  However, the running `KieSessions` need additional synchronization points to make the dynamic update possible and consistent. Therefore, a new `KieBaseMutabilityOption` is introduced to optionally disable the possibility of performing an incremental update on a given `KieBase`.

The `KieBaseMutabilityOption` consists of two values including `ALLOWED` and `DISABLED`.  The default value of `KieBaseMutabilityOption` is `ALLOWED`. However, to incrementally update a `KieBase`, set the value of `KieBaseMutabilityOption` as `DISABLED` in the `kmodule.xml` file or set the following system property for all KIE bases.
