== New KieBaseMutabilityOption
By default it is always possible to dynamically and incrementally change at runtime a `KieBase` together with all the running `KieSessions` created from it.
This possibility however has a runtime performance cost, because all running `KieSessions` need to have additional synchronization points to make this dynamic update possible and consistent.
For this reason it has been introduced an additional `KieBaseMutabilityOption` that allows to optionally disable the possibility of performing an incremental update on a given `KieBase`.

This new `KieBaseOption` has 2 possible values: `ALLOWED` and `DISABLED`. To keep backward compatibility `ALLOWED` is the default value, but, in case you don't need to incremenatally update a `KieBase`, for performances reasons it is strongly recommended to set this option to `DISABLED`.
You can achieve this either adding this option for a specific `KieBase` in the `kmodule.xml` file as it follows

[source,xml]
----
<kbase name="KBase1" mutability="disabled">
----

or more generally for all your `KieBases` setting the system property

[source,java]
----
drools.kieBaseMutability=disabled
----
