== Browsing graphs of objects with OOPath

[WARNING]
====
This feature is experimental
====


When the field of a fact is a collection it is possible to bind and reason over all the items in that collection on by one using the `from` keyword.
Nevertheless, when it is required to browse a graph of object the extensive use of the `from` conditional element may result in a verbose and cubersome syntax like in the following example: 

.Browsing a graph of objects with from
====
[source]
----
rule "Find all grades for Big Data exam" when
    $student: Student( $plan: plan )
    $exam: Exam( course == "Big Data" ) from $plan.exams
    $grade: Grade() from $exam.grades
then /* RHS */ end
----
====


In this example it has been assumed to use a domain model consisting of a `Student` who has a `Plan` of study: a `Plan` can have zero or more ``Exam``s and an `Exam` zero or more ``Grade``s.
Note that only the root object of the graph (the `Student` in this case) needs to be in the working memory in order to make this works.

By borrowing ideas from XPath, this syntax can be made more succinct, as XPath has a compact notation for navigating through related elements while handling collections and filtering constraints.
This XPath-inspired notation has been called `OOPath` since it is explictly intended to browse graph of objects.
Using this notation the former example can be rewritten as it follows: 

.Browsing a graph of objects with OOPath
====
[source]
----
rule "Find all grades for Big Data exam" when
    Student( $grade: /plan/exams[course == "Big Data"]/grades )
then /* RHS */ end
----
====


Formally, the core grammar of an `OOPath` expression can be defined in EBNF notation in this way.

[source]
----
OOPExpr = "/" OOPSegment { ( "/" | "." ) OOPSegment } ;
OOPSegment = [ID ( ":" | ":=" )] ID ["[" Number "]"] ["{" Constraints "}"];
----


In practice an `OOPath` expression has the following features.

* It has to start with ``/``.
* It can dereference a single property of an object with the `$$.$$` operator
* It can dereference a multiple property of an object using the `/` operator. If a collection is returned, it will iterate over the values in the collection
* While traversing referenced objects it can filter away those not satisfying one or more constraints, written as predicate expressions between curly brackets like in:
+

[source]
----
Student( $grade: /plan/exams[course == "Big Data"]/grades )
----
* Items can also be accessed by their index by putting it between square brackets like in:
+

[source]
----
Student( $grade: /plan/exams[0]/grades )
----
+
To adhere to Java convention OOPath indexes are 0-based, compared to XPath 1-based


=== Reactive OOPath


At the moment Drools is not able to react to updates involving a deeply nested traversed during the evaluation of an `OOPath` expression.
To make these objects reactive to changes at the moment it is necessary to make them extend the class ``org.drools.core.phreak.ReactiveObject``.
It is planned to overcome this limitation by implementing a mechanism that automatically instruments the classes belonging to a specific domain model.

Having extendend that class, the domain objects can notify the engine when one of its field has been updated by invoking the inherited method `notifyModification` as in the following example:

.Notifying the engine that an exam has been moved to a different course
====
[source]
----
public void setCourse(String course) {
    this.course = course;
    notifyModification(this);
}
----
====


In this way if an exam is moved to a different course, the rule is re-triggered and the list of grades matching the rule recomputed.
