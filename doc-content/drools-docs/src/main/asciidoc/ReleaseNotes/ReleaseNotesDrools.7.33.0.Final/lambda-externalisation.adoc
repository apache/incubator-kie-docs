= Executable model lambda externalization optimization

The new executable model optimization improves memory consumption at runtime. It rewrites how the lambdas are generated that are used in the executable model.

Use the following key to enable the lambda externalization for an executable model.

```
 -Ddrools.externaliseCanonicalModelLambda=true
```

Lambda externalization optimization provides the following advantages for your projects:

    You can now reuse the same lambda multiple times with all the patterns with the same constraint.

    Once the rete or phreak is instantiated from an executable model, it becomes garbage collectible.

The above advantages provide optimized memory performance, however, it can also lead to `OutOfMemory` error.
