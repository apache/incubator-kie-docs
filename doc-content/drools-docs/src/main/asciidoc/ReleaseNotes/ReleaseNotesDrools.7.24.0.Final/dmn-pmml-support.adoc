= PMML support in DMN included models

You can now use the *Included Models* tab in the Decision Model and Notation (DMN) designer in {CENTRAL} to include PMML models from your project in a specified DMN file. When you include a PMML model within a DMN file, you can invoke that PMML model as a boxed function expression for a DMN decision node or business knowledge model node.
