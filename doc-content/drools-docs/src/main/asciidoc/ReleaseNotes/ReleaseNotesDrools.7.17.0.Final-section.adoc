= New and Noteworthy in Drools 7.17

== Minor changes in DMN FEEL built-in functions' parameter names

Previous releases of Drools offered (optionally) a FEEL built-in function `split()` as an extended function, beyond the DMN v1.1 specification.
In order to align with version v1.2 of the DMN specification, which now includes `split()` as part of the standardised FEEL built-in functions set, the function parameter names have been aligned to the ones mandated by the DMN specification itself, with the signature `split( string, delimiter )` as specified in Table 68 of the DMN v1.2 specification document.
