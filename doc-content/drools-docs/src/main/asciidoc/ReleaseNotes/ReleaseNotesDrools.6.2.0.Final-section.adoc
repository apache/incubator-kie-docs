= New and Noteworthy in Drools 6.2.0

== Propagation modes


The introduction of PHREAK as default algorithm for the {DECISION_ENGINE} made the rules' evaluation lazy.
This new Drools lazy behavior allowed a relevant performance boost but, in some very specific cases, breaks the semantic of a few Drools features.

More precisely in some circumstances it is necessary to propagate the insertion of new fact into th session immediately.
For instance Drools allows a query to be executed in pull only (or passive) mode by prepending a '?' symbol to its invocation as in the following example:

.A passive query
====
[source,java]
----
query Q (Integer i)
    String( this == i.toString() )
end
rule R when
    $i : Integer()
    ?Q( $i; )
then
    System.out.println( $i );
end
----
====


In this case, since the query is passive, it shouldn't react to the insertion of a String matching the join condition in the query itself.
In other words this sequence of commands

[source,java]
----
KieSession ksession = ...
ksession.insert(1);
ksession.insert("1");
ksession.fireAllRules();
----


shouldn't cause the rule R to fire because the String satisfying the query condition has been inserted after the Integer and the passive query shouldn't react to this insertion.
Conversely the rule should fire if the insertion sequence is inverted because the insertion of the Integer, when the passive query can be satisfied by the presence of an already existing String, will trigger it.

Unfortunately the lazy nature of PHREAK doesn't allow the {DECISION_ENGINE} to make any distinction regarding the insertion sequence of the two facts, so the rule will fire in both cases.
In circumstances like this it is necessary to evaluate the rule eagerly as done by the old RETEOO-based engine.

In other cases it is required that the propagation is eager, meaning that it is not immedate, but anyway has to happen before the {DECISION_ENGINE}/agenda starts scheduled evaluations.
For instance this is necessary when a rule has the no-loop or the lock-on-active attribute and in fact when this happens this propagation mode is automatically enforced by the {DECISION_ENGINE}.

To cover these use cases, and in all other situations where an immediate or eager rule evaluation is required, it is possible to declaratively specify so by annotating the rule itself with **@Propagation(Propagation.Type)**, where Propagation.Type is an enumeration with 3 possible values:

* *IMMEDIATE* means that the propagation is performed immediately.
* *EAGER* means that the propagation is performed lazily but eagerly evaluated before scheduled evaluations.
* *LAZY* means that the propagation is totally lazy and this is default PHREAK behaviour


This means that the following drl:

.A data-driven rule using a passive query
====
[source,java]
----
query Q (Integer i)
    String( this == i.toString() )
end
rule R @Propagation(IMMEDIATE) when
    $i : Integer()
    ?Q( $i; )
then
    System.out.println( $i );
end
----
====


will make the rule R to fire if and only if the Integer is inserted after the String, thus behaving in accordance with the semantic of the passive query.
