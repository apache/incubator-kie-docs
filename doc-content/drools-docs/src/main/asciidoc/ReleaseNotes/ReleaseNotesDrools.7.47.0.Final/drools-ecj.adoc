== Descope of Eclipse Java Compiler

Since the beginning, {DECISION_ENGINE} relies on in memory compilation of automatically generated java sources. This need has become
even more relevant with the introduction of the executable model. Historically {DECISION_ENGINE} can perform this in memory compilation
with either Eclipse Java Compiler (the default choice) or using the compiler natively provided by the JDK since Java 7.

Continuing the recent efforts aimed to better modularize the core engine and descope the feautures that are not strictly necessary,
the use of the Eclipse Java Compiler has been isolated and moved into a new module called `drools-ecj`. This means that, not
having this new module in the classpath, {DECISION_ENGINE} will perform all the necessary in memory compilation using the native
java compiler. Conversely with `drools-ecj` in the classpath the Eclipse Java Compiler will return to be the default compiler
without the need of any other further configuration.

Since the purpose of the module `drools-engine-classic`, introduced with {DECISION_ENGINE} 7.45.0.Final, is maintaining the compatibility
with of all legacy behaviours of {DECISION_ENGINE} a dependency to `drools-ecj` has been added also there.
