= What is New and Noteworthy in Drools 7.12

== End of support for `drools-rhq-plugin` component

The `drools-rhq-plugin` component for monitoring {PRODUCT} using JBoss Operations Network is no longer supported because it is underutilized and has become outdated.

== Support for executable models in DMN projects

You can now use the `kie-maven-plugin` build component to generate DMN executable model classes and compile them in a {PRODUCT} project (`kjar`). This support increases compile time, run time, and development time for your DMN projects.

To build a DMN project from an executable model, navigate to your Maven project directory in a command terminal and run the following command:
--
[source]
----
mvn clean install -DgenerateDMNModel=<VALUE>
----

Replace `<VALUE>` with one of two values:

* `YES`: Generates the executable model corresponding to the DMN files in the original project.
* `NO`: Does not generate the executable model.

Alternatively you can define the property directly in the pom.xml file

[source]
----
<project>
  ...
  <properties>
    <generateDMNModel>yes</generateDMNModel>
  </properties>
  ...
</project>
----
