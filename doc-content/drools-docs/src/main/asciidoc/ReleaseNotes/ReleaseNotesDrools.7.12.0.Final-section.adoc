= What is New and Noteworthy in Drools 7.12

== End of support for `drools-rhq-plugin` component

The `drools-rhq-plugin` component for monitoring {PRODUCT} using JBoss Operations Network is no longer supported because it is underutilized and has become outdated.

== Support compiled classes in a kjar while using executable model in DMN projects

It is possible now to use the drools maven plugin to generate the DMN's executable model classes and compile them in a kjar,
this should lead to faster startup times.

In a command terminal, navigate to your Maven project directory and run the following command to build the project from an executable model:

--
[source]
----
mvn clean install -DgenerateDMNModel=<VALUE>
----

Replace `<VALUE>` with one of three values:

* `YES`: Generates the executable model corresponding to the DMN files in the original project.
* `NO`: Does not generate the executable model.
