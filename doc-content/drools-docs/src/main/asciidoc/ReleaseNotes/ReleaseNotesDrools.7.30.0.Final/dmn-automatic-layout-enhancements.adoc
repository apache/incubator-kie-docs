= DMN automatic layout and decision service enhancements

In the DMN designer in {CENTRAL}, if you delete a decision service node from a decision requirements diagram (DRD), the nodes inside of the decision service are not deleted as they were in previous releases. Also, when the automatic layout is applied to imported DMN models, the nodes inside of a decision service node are not reordered outside of the decision service node as they were in previous releases.

The height and width of each DMN node is retained when automatic layout is applied instead of using the default size of 100x50 pixels.

You can also select *Perform automatic layout* in the DMN designer toolbar if DMN nodes that you import from other vendors are not automatically formatted during the import.
