= Automatic Layout and Decision Service Enhancements

If you delete a "Decision Service" the nodes inside it are note deleted.

When you perform "Automatic Layout" in the DMN models, the nodes inside the "Decision Service" are not reordered to outside the "Decision Service" anymore.

The height and width of each node is considered for "Automatic Layout" instead of the default size of 100x50.

You can also perform "Automatic Layout" in nodes imported from other vendors.
