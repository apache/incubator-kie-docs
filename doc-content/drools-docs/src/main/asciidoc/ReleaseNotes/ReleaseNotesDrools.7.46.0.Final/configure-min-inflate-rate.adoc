= Configuring min inflate rate for decision tables parser

Apache POI, that {DECISION_ENGINE} uses to parse decision tables, introduced for secutity reasons a limit to the ratio
between the compressed and uncompressed size of a spreadsheet that is defaulted to 0.01. Its intent is blocking
all maliciously formatted documents that when uncompressed could blow up a machine due to excessive memory usage while
still allowing to process almost all valid documents.

For some specific decision tables that limit could be too strict and prevent the parsing of valid spreadsheets. For this
circumstances the new system property `drools.excelParser.minInflateRatio` has been introduced to lower this limit and
allow the parsing of such decision tables.
