= Enhanced performance of inequality rule constraints
Alpha node range index is implemented to improve the performance of the inequality rule constraints, such as `Person(age > 20)`. You can configure the alpha node range index threshold using the `drools.alphaNodeRangeIndexThreshold` system property.
