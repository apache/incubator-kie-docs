= Test scenario API on {KIE_SERVER}

A new API is available on {KIE_SERVER} to execute a test scenario file. The capability is disabled by default, use `org.kie.scenariosimulation.server.ext.disabled` property to enable it.

It is now possible to send the content of a test scenario file to execute the simulation against a KieContainer.
