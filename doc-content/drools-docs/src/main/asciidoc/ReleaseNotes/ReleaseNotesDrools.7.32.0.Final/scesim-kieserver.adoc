= Test scenario API on {KIE_SERVER}

You can now use the {KIE_SERVER} REST API to execute the test scenarios externally. It executes the test scenarios against the deployed project. This functionality is disabled by default, use `org.kie.scenariosimulation.server.ext.disabled` property to enable it.

It is now possible to send the content of a test scenario file to execute the simulation against a KieContainer.
