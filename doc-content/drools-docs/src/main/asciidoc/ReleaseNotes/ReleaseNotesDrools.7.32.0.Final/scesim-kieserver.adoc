= Test Scenario API on {KIE_SERVER}

A new API is available on {KIE_SERVER} to execute a Test Scenario file. The capability is disabled by default, use `org.kie.prometheus.server.ext.disabled` property to enable it.

It is now possible to send the content of a Test Scenario file to execute the simulation against a KieContainer.
