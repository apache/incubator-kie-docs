= What is New and Noteworthy in Drools 7.18

== New Builder Options

=== TrimCellsInDTableOption

By default all the value of the cells in decision tables are trimmed before being processed. There could be situations where
this automatic trimming is not required or even detrimental. In this cases it is now possible to disable the trimming using
the new TrimCellsInDTableOption or the correspondent "drools.trimCellsInDTable" System property.

== GroupDRLsInKieBasesByFolderOption

By default all the Drools artifacts under the resources folder, at any level, are included into the KieBase.
From now on, the packages attribute of the kmodule.xml allows to limit the artifacts that will be compiled in this KieBase
to only the ones belonging to the list of packages. However older versions of Drools actually checked the folder
name instead of the package one. The new  GroupDRLsInKieBasesByFolderOption or the correspondent
"drools.groupDRLsInKieBasesByFolder" System property allows to re-enable that old folder-based behaviour.
