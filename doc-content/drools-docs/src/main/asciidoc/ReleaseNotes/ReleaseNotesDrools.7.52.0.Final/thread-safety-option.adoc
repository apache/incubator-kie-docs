= New `ThreadSafeOption`

By default, a `KieSession` at runtime is thread safe and then it can be safely shared and used by multiple threads at the same time. However, to support thread safety, the running `KieSession` requires additional synchronization points that can eventually slow down performances even when such thread safety is not required. Therefore, a new `ThreadSafeOption` is introduced to optionally disable the thread safety.

The new `ThreadSafeOption` consists of two values including `YES` and `NO`.  The default value of `ThreadSafeOption` is `YES`. However, when thread safety of `KieSession` is not required, then set the value of `ThreadSafeOption` as `NO` to avoid the performance costs caused by the previously mentioned synchronization points. It is possible to set this option either in the `kmodule.xml` file for a specific `KieSession` or using the following system property for all KieSession.
