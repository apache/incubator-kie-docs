= New `ThreadSafeOption` to disable thread-safety of a `KieSession`

As per the default configuration, a `KieSession` is thread-safe and can be shared safely and used by multiple threads at the same time. However, if a `KieSession` is running, it requires additional synchronization points to support the thread-safety, which is not required, and eventually, it slows the performance of the `KieSession`. Therefore, a new `ThreadSafeOption` is introduced, which you can use to optionally disable the thread-safety. The `ThreadSafeOption` consists of two values including `YES` (default) and `NO`.

When the thread-safety is not required for a `KieSession`, then set the value of `ThreadSafeOption` as `NO` to avoid the performance costs. You can set the `ThreadSafeOption` for a specific `KieSession` in the `kmodule.xml` file or you can use the following system property for all KIE sessions.

<ksession name="KSession1" threadSafe="false">
