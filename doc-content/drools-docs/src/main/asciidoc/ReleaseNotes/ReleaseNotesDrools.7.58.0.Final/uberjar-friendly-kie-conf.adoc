= Uberjar friendly kie.conf

Many modules of Drools (e.g. drools-core, drools-compiler) have a file named `kie.conf` containing the names of the classes implementing the services provided by the corresponding module. Those files were all directly placed under the folder `META-INF`, so that when creating an uberjar containing a few Drools module, it was necessary to use the Maven Shade Plugin in order to merge all those `kie.conf` files into a single one.

In this release those files have been respectively moved to `META-INF/kie/{module-name}/kie.conf`. This makes Drools more uberjar friendly and in particular is no longer necessary to use any plugin when packaging an uberjar containing Drools modules. It is still possible for users to provide their own customized `kie.conf` file putting it under `META-INF/kie/kie.conf`.
