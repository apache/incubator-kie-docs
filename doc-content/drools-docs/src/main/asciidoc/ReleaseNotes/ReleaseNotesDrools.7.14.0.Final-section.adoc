= What is New and Noteworthy in Drools 7.14

== File-system based KieScanner

The `KieScanner` allows continuous monitoring of your Maven repository to check whether a new release of a Kie project has been installed
and if so it live updates the running `KieContainer` with the newer version of that project. However in many cases installing a maven
repository is impractical especially in production environment. For this reason it is now possible to have a `KieScanner` that works
by simply fetching update from a folder of a plain file system. You can create and start such a `KieScanner` as simply as

====
[source,java]
----
KieServices kieServices = KieServices.Factory.get();
KieScanner kScanner = kieServices.newKieScanner( kContainer, "/myrepo/kjars" );

// Start the KieScanner polling the Maven repository every 10 seconds
kScanner.start( 10000L );
----
====

where "/myrepo/kjars" will be the folder where the `KieScanner` will look for kjar updates. The jar files placed in this folder
have to follow the maven convention and then have to be a name in the form {artifactId}-{versionId}.jar

== Support for executable models in DMN projects

You can now use the `kie-maven-plugin` build component to generate DMN executable model classes and compile them in a {PRODUCT} project (`kjar`). This support enables DMN decision table logic in DMN projects to be evaluated more efficiently.

To enable executable models in DMN projects, add the required `kie-dmn-core` dependency in the `pom.xml` file:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.kie</groupId>
  <artifactId>kie-dmn-core</artifactId>
  <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
----

To build a DMN project enabling executable model compilation, navigate to your Maven project directory in a command terminal and run the following command:

[source]
----
mvn clean install -DgenerateDMNModel=yes
----

Alternatively, you can define the property directly in the `pom.xml` file:

[source,xml]
----
<project>
  ...
  <properties>
    <generateDMNModel>yes</generateDMNModel>
  </properties>
  ...
</project>
----
