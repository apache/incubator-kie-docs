== Allow to declare serialVersionUID on classes generated from declared types

To improve the compatibility of serialized KieSession, it has been introduced the possibility to specify the serialVersionUID
on the classes generated from the declared types through an annotation like the following:

[source]
----
declare MyClass
  @serialVersionUID( 42 )
  name : String
end
----

== Declaratively set Calendars on KieSession via kmodule.xml

It is possible to declaratively set one or more Calendars on a KieSession through the kmodule.xml configuration file as
in the following example:

[source]
----
<ksession name="KSession1">
  <calendars>
    <calendar name="monday" type="org.domain.Monday"/>
  </calendars>
</ksession>
----

where the type is the name of class implementing the `org.kie.api.time.Calendar` interface.

== KieSessions pool

In high volume use cases `KieSession`s get created and disposed with a very high frequency. In general this operation is not
extremely time consuming, but when repeated millions of times can become a bottleneck and also requires a huge GC effort.
Some users tried to alleviate this problem with self-made pools and for this reason it has been decided to provide this
solution out-of-the-box.

To obtain a pool of `KieSession` from a `KieContainer` is enough to invoke on it the method

[source]
----
KieContainerSessionsPool KieContainer.newKieSessionsPool(int initialSize)
----

where `initialSize` is the number of the `KieSession`s that will be initially created in the pool. However, if required by the running
application, the number of `KieSession`s in the pool will dynamically grow beyond that value. At this point you can create
`KieSession`s from that pool as you would normally do from a `KieContainer`:

[source]
----
KieContainerSessionsPool pool = kContainer.newKieSessionsPool(10);
KieSession kSession = pool.newKieSession();
----

Now you can use the KieSession as per normal, and when you call `dispose()` on it, instead of being destroyed, it just
gets resetted and pushed back into the pool. Note that using this pool will also affect the case when you have one or more
`StatelessKieSession`s and you keep reusing them with multiple call to the `execute()` method. In fact a  `StatelessKieSession`
created directly from a `KieContainer` will keep to internally create a new `KieSession` for each `execute()` invocation.
Conversely if you create the `StatelessKieSession` from the pool it will internally uses the `KieSession`s provided by the
pool itself. In other words even if you asked a `StatelessKieSession` to the pool, what is actually pooled are the `KieSession`s
that are wrapped by it.

Once you're done with the pool it is required that you call the `shutdown()` method on it to avoid memory leaks. Alternatively
calling `dispose()` on the whole `KieContainer` will also automatically shutdown all the pools eventually created from it.
