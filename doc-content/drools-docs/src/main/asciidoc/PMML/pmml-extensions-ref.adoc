= PMML extensions in {PRODUCT}

The PMML legacy specification supports `Extension` elements that extend the content of a PMML model. You can use extensions at almost every level of a PMML model definition, and as the first and last child in the main element of a model for maximum flexibility. For more information about PMML extensions, see the DMG PMML http://dmg.org/pmml/v4-2-1/GeneralStructure.html#xsdElement_Extension[Extension Mechanism].

To optimize PMML integration, {PRODUCT} supports the following additional PMML extensions:

* `modelPackage`: Designates a package name for the generated rules and Java classes. Include this extension in the `Header` section of the PMML model file.
* `adapter`: Designates the type of construct (`bean` or `trait`) that is used to contain input and output data for rules. Insert this extension in the `MiningSchema` or `Output` section (or both) of the PMML model file.
* `externalClass`: Used in conjunction with the `adapter` extension in defining a `MiningField` or `OutputField`. This extension contains a class with an attribute name that matches the name of the `MiningField` or `OutputField` element.
////
//Removed the following since deprecated, but retaining in case a user raises a need.
* `ruleflow-group`: Designates the `ruleflow-group` that should be applied to the generated rules.
* `agenda-group`: Designates the `agenda-group` that should be applied to the generated rules.

WARNING: The `ruleflow-group` and the `agenda-group` extensions are deprecated and should not be used in new PMML model files.
