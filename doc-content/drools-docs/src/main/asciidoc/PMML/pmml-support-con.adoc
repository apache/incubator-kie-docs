{PRODUCT} does not include a built-in PMML model editor, but you can use an XML or PMML-specific authoring tool to create PMML models and then integrate the PMML models in your decision services in {PRODUCT}. You can import PMML files into your project in {CENTRAL} (*Menu -> Design -> Projects -> Import Asset*) or package the PMML files as part of your project knowledge JAR (KJAR) file without {CENTRAL}.

For more information about including assets such as PMML files with your project packaging and deployment method, see
