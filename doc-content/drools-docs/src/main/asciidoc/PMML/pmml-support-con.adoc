[id='pmml-support-con_{context}']
= PMML support in {PRODUCT}

{PRODUCT} includes consumer conformance support for the following PMML 4.2.1 model types:

* http://dmg.org/pmml/v4-2-1/Regression.html[Regression models]
* http://dmg.org/pmml/v4-2-1/Scorecard.html[Scorecard models]
* http://dmg.org/pmml/v4-2-1/TreeModel.html[Tree models]
* http://dmg.org/pmml/v4-2-1/MultipleModels.html#xsdElement_MiningModel[Mining models] (with sub-types `modelChain`, `selectAll`, and `selectFirst`)

For a list of all PMML model types, including those not supported in {PRODUCT}, see the DMG http://dmg.org/pmml/v4-2-1/GeneralStructure.html[PMML specification].

{PRODUCT} does not include a built-in PMML model editor, but you can use an XML or PMML-specific authoring tool to create PMML models and then integrate the PMML models in your decision services in {PRODUCT}. You can import PMML files into your project in {CENTRAL} (*Menu -> Design -> Projects -> Import Asset*) or package the PMML files as part of your project knowledge JAR (KJAR) file without {CENTRAL}.

When you add a PMML file to a project in {PRODUCT}, multiple assets are generated. Each type of PMML model generates a different set of assets, but all PMML model types generate at least the following set of assets:

* A DRL file that contains all of the rules associated with your PMML model
* At least two Java classes:
** A data class that is used as the default object type for the model type
** A `RuleUnit` class that is used to manage data sources and rule execution

If a PMML file has `MiningModel` as the root model, multiple instances of each of these files are generated.
