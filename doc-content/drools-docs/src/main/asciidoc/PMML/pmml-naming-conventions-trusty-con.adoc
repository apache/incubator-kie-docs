= PMML trusty support and naming conventions in {PRODUCT}

When you add a PMML file to a project in {PRODUCT}, multiple assets are generated. The tree and scorecard models are translated to rules, and regression and mining models are translated to Java classes. Each type of PMML model generates a different set of assets, but all PMML model types generate at least the following set of assets:

* A root package whose name is derived from the PMML file name
* In the root package, a Java factory class that is used to instantiate the model
* A subpackage specific to the model whose name is derived from the model name
* For rule models, two `rule-mapper` classes that are used to instantiate the rule network
* For mining models, children model packages and classes are nested in the parent model

NOTE: Currently, only one model for each PMML file is allowed. Also, extensions are temporarily not supported.

The following are naming conventions for generated PMML packages and classes:

* The root package name is the name of the original PMML file in lowercase and without space, for example, `sampleregression`.
* The name of the generated `factory` Java class is the PMML file name with `Factory` added to it in the format `fileName+"Factory"` and first uppercase letter, for example, `SampleRegressionFactory`.
* The subpackage name of a model is the name of the original model in lowercase and without space, for example, `compoundnestedpredicatescorecard`.
* The names of the generated data classes are determined by the model type:
** Rules models: A top-level `PMMLRuleMappersImpl` is generated including references to `PMMLRuleMapperImpl` classes that are nested in the subpackages.
** Mining models:
*** The name of the created `segmentation` subpackage is the name of the original model in lowercase, without space, and `segmentation` added to it in the format `modelName+”segmentation”`, for example, `mixedminingsegmentation`.
*** In the `segmentation` subpackage, a `segmentation` Java class is created that contains the references to the nested models. The name of the created `segmentation` Java class is the model name with `Segmentation` added to it in the format `modelName+Segmentation`, for example, `MixedMiningSegmentation`.
*** For each segment, a specific subpackage is created. The name of the segment specific subpackage is the original model name in lowercase with `segment` and a progressive integer starting from 0 added to it in the format `modelName+segment+integer`. For example, `mixedminingsegment0`, `mixedminingsegment1`.
