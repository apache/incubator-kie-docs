= PMML legacy support and naming conventions in {PRODUCT}

When you add a PMML file to a project in {PRODUCT}, multiple assets are generated. Each type of PMML model generates a different set of assets, but all PMML model types generate at least the following set of assets:

* A DRL file that contains all of the rules associated with your PMML model
* At least two Java classes:
** A data class that is used as the default object type for the model type
** A `RuleUnit` class that is used to manage data sources and rule execution

If a PMML file has `MiningModel` as the root model, multiple instances of each of these files are generated.

The following are naming conventions for generated PMML legacy packages, classes, and rules:

* If no package name is given in a PMML model file, then the default package name `org.kie.pmml.pmml_4_2` is prefixed to the model name for the generated rules in the format `"org.kie.pmml.pmml_4_2"+modelName`.
* The package name for the generated `RuleUnit` Java class is the same as the package name for the generated rules.
* The name of the generated `RuleUnit` Java class is the model name with `RuleUnit` added to it in the format `modelName+"RuleUnit"`.
* Each PMML model has at least one data class that is generated. The package name for these classes is `org.kie.pmml.pmml_4_2.model`.
* The names of generated data classes are determined by the model type, prefixed with the model name:
** Regression models: One data class named `modelName+"RegressionData"`
** Scorecard models: One data class named `modelName+"ScoreCardData"`
** Tree models: Two data classes, the first named `modelName+"TreeNode"` and the second named `modelName+"TreeToken"`
** Mining models: One data class named `modelName+"MiningModelData"`

NOTE: The mining model also generates all of the rules and classes that are within each of its segments.
