== PMML Conformance

The version of PMML that is supported for use with {context} is version 4.2.1. PMML standard supports 13 primary model types, and an aggregation/composition model called a Mining Model.
This release of {context} includes support of the following model types:

* http://dmg.org/pmml/v4-2-1/Regression.html[*Regression*] [.small]#(*_Simple Regression_*)#
* http://dmg.org/pmml/v4-2-1/Scorecard.html[*Scorecard*]
* http://dmg.org/pmml/v4-2-1/TreeModel.html[*Tree*] [.small]#(*_Decision Tree_*)#
* http://dmg.org/pmml/v4-2-1/MultipleModels.html#xsdElement_MiningModel[*Mining Model*]

[NOTE]
You can see a the complete set of models supported by PMML at the http://dmg.org/pmml/v4-3/GeneralStructure.html[*DMG website*].

=== Extensions
The PMML specification allows for http://dmg.org/pmml/v4-2-1/GeneralStructure.html#xsdElement_Extension[Extension] elements at almost every level of the model definition.
In order to facilitate some functionality, {context} has a few pre-defined extensions.

* modelPackage - This extension should be included in the Header section of the PMML file. It is used to designate a package name for the generated rules and Java classes.
* adapter - This extension should be included in the MiningSchema and/or Output section(s) of a model definition. It is used to tell the rules about the kind of construct
(BEAN or TRAIT) that is used to contain input/output data.
* externalClass - Used in conjunction with the *adapter* extension, in defining a MiningField or OutputField. This extension holds
the name of the class that contains an attribute whose name matches the name of the mining/output field.
* ruleflow-group - Used to designate the ruleflow-group that should be applied to the generated rules
* agenda-group - Used to designate the agenda-group that should be applied to the generated rules

[WARNING]
The *ruleflow-group* and the *agenda-group* extensions are deprecated and should not be used in new PMML model files
