= PMML conformance levels

The PMML specification defines producer and consumer conformance levels in a software implementation to ensure that PMML models are created and integrated reliably. For the formal definitions of each conformance level, see the DMG http://dmg.org/pmml/v4-2-1/Conformance.html[PMML conformance] page.

The following are summaries of the PMML conformance levels:

Producer conformance::
A tool or application is producer conforming if it generates valid PMML documents for at least one type of model. Satisfying PMML producer conformance requirements ensures that a model definition document is syntactically correct and defines a model instance that is consistent with semantic criteria that are defined in model specifications.

Consumer conformance::
An application is consumer conforming if it accepts valid PMML documents for at least one type of model. Satisfying consumer conformance requirements ensures that a PMML model created according to producer conformance can be integrated and used as defined. For example, if an application is consumer conforming for Regression model types, then valid PMML documents defining models of this type produced by different conforming producers would be interchangeable in the application.

{PRODUCT} includes consumer conformance support for the following PMML 4.2.1 model types:

* http://dmg.org/pmml/v4-2-1/Regression.html[Regression models]
* http://dmg.org/pmml/v4-2-1/Scorecard.html[Scorecard models]
* http://dmg.org/pmml/v4-2-1/TreeModel.html[Tree models]
* http://dmg.org/pmml/v4-2-1/MultipleModels.html#xsdElement_MiningModel[Mining models] (with sub-types `modelChain`, `selectAll`, and `selectFirst`)

For a list of all PMML model types, including those not supported in {PRODUCT}, see the DMG http://dmg.org/pmml/v4-2-1/GeneralStructure.html[PMML specification].
