== PMML Naming Conventions
There are a few naming conventions that should be noted, with regards to the generated
packages, classes, and rules.

* If no package name is given in the PMML resource file then a default package name
of "`org.kie.pmml.pmml_4_2.`", concatenated with the model name, will be used for the generated rules
* The package for the generated RuleUnit java class will be the same as the package name for the generated rules
* The name of the generated RuleUnit java class will be the model name, concatenated with "RuleUnit"
* Each model has at least one data class that is generated. The package name for these classes is `org.kie.pmml.pmml_4_2.model`
* The name(s) of the generated data classes are dependent on the type of model. In each case, the name of the class starts
with the name of the model
** Scorecard Model - A single data class, which is named modelName+"ScoreCardData"
** Tree Model - Two data classes; the first named modelName+"TreeNode", and the second named modelName+"TreeToken"
** Regression Model - One data class, named modelName+"RegressionData"
** Mining Model - There is a single data class, named modelName+"MiningModelData"

[NOTE]
The mining model also generates all of the rules and classes that are within each of its segments.
