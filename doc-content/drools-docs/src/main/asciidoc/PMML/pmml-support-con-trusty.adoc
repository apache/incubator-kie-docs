= Support in {PRODUCT}

When you add a PMML file to a project in {PRODUCT}, multiple assets are generated. Some models (`Tree`, `Scorecard`) are translated to `rules`, while other (`Regression`, `MiningModel`) are translated to Java classes. Each type of PMML model generates a different set of assets, but all PMML model types generate at least the following set of assets:

* a root package whose name is derived from the file name
* inside that package, a Java factory class that is used to instantiate the actual model
* a model-specific sub-package whose name is derived from the model name
* inside that sub-package:
** some generated classes extending one of the `KiePMMLModel` implementations
** for `rules` models, a couple of `rule-mapper` classes that are used to instantiate the rule network
* for `MiningModel`, children model' packages/classes are nested inside the parent one.

Currently, only one model per PMML file is allowed.
`Extensions` are momentarily unsupported.
