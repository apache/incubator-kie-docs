== PMML resources

PMML resources are XML files that conform to the http://dmg.org/pmml/v4-2-1/pmml-4-2.xsd[*PMML schema*].
These files are usually generated as output from a data analysis and/or modeling tool.

[NOTE]
PMML resource files contain a single model. The exception to this is a resource that has a MiningModel as the root model.

== Using PMML resources in a project
The first step in using PMML resources is to make sure the project is ready to work with PMML resources.

==== Workbench based projects
Import the PMML resource using the Import Asset functionality that is included in the workbench.

==== IDE/Command-line based projects
To use a PMML resource from an IDE, or command-line maven, project make that you include both the
kie-pmml jar, and the kie-api jar, in your project's pom file.

Once you have made sure that your project includes the PMML library, you can add the PMML model by
placing the PMML file into the resources directory for your project.
