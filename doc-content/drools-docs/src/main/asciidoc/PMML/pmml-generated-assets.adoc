== Assets from PMML

Adding a PMML resource to your project does much more than simply create another asset in the kjar that is created by your project.
Each PMML resource added to a project results a number of assets being generated. Each type of model generates a different set of
assets, but all of the models types generate the following minimum set of assets.

* A DRL file that contains all of the rules associated with your model
* At least two Java classes
- A data class that is used as the default object type for the model type
- A RuleUnit class that is used as to manage execution of the rules, and to manage data sources

In the case where the resource has a MiningModel as the root model, there will be multiple instances
of each of these files.
