= Options for invoking a PMML model

You can import PMML files into your {PRODUCT} project using {CENTRAL} (*Menu -> Design -> Projects -> Import Asset*) or package the PMML files as part of your project knowledge JAR (KJAR) file without {CENTRAL}. After you implement your PMML files in your {PRODUCT} project, you can invoke the PMML-based decision service by embedding PMML calls directly in your Java application.

Currently, embedding PMML calls directly in your Java application is the available method for deploying and executing PMML models that are integrated with {PRODUCT}. Other options for invoking PMML models (such as with {KIE_SERVER}) will be available in a future release and will be added to PMML documentation.

For more information about including PMML assets with your project packaging and deployment method, see
