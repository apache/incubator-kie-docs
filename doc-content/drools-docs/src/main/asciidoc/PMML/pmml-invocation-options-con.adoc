= PMML model execution

You can import PMML files into your {PRODUCT} project using {CENTRAL} (*Menu -> Design -> Projects -> Import Asset*) or package the PMML files as part of your project knowledge JAR (KJAR) file without {CENTRAL}. After you implement your PMML files in your {PRODUCT} project, you can execute the PMML-based decision service by embedding PMML calls directly in your Java application or by sending an `ApplyPmmlModelCommand` command to a configured {KIE_SERVER}.

For more information about including PMML assets with your project packaging and deployment method, see
