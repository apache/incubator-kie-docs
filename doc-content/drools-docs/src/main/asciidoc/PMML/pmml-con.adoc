== Predictive Model Markup Language

The Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) standard was created, and is maintained, by the http://dmg.org/pmml/pmml-v4-2-1.html[*Data Mining Group*] (*DMG*).
PMML provides a standardized way for applications to define statistical and data mining models, and to share models between PMML compliant applications.

The vendor-independent specification provides applications with a way to define models, without the issues that often arise from proprietary constructs, and other incompatibilities.
This allows users to develop models using one vendor's application, and then use other vendors' applications to visualize, analyze, and otherwise make use of the model.
