= Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML)

Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) is an XML-based standard established by the Data Mining Group (DMG) for defining statistical and data-mining models. PMML models can be shared between PMML-compliant platforms and across organizations so that business analysts and developers are unified in designing, analyzing, and implementing PMML-based assets and services.

For more information about the background and applications of PMML, see the DMG http://dmg.org/pmml/pmml-v4-4-1.html[PMML specification].
