= Support in {PRODUCT}

When you add a PMML file to a project in {PRODUCT}, multiple assets are generated. Each type of PMML model generates a different set of assets, but all PMML model types generate at least the following set of assets:

* A DRL file that contains all of the rules associated with your PMML model
* At least two Java classes:
** A data class that is used as the default object type for the model type
** A `RuleUnit` class that is used to manage data sources and rule execution

If a PMML file has `MiningModel` as the root model, multiple instances of each of these files are generated.
