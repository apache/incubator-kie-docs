= Naming conventions in {PRODUCT}

The following are naming conventions for generated PMML packages and classes:

* the root package name is the lower-cased, no space, name of the original PMML file (e.g. `SampleRegression.pmml` -> `sampleregression`)
* the name of the generated `factory` Java class is the PMML file name with `Factory` added to it in the format `file-name` + `Factory`, first letter uppercase (e.g. `sampleRegression.pmml` -> `SampleRegressionFactory`)
* the model-specific sub-package name is the lower-cased, no space, name of the original model (e.g. `CompoundNestedPredicateScorecard` -> `compoundnestedpredicatescorecard`)
* for rules models, a top-level `PMMLRuleMappersImpl` is generated, that includes references to `PMMLRuleMapperImpl` classes nested in subpackages
* for `MiningModel`
** a `segmentation` sub-package is created, whose name is the lower-cased, no space, name of the original model followed by `segmentation` (e.g. `MixedMining` -> `mixedMiningsegmentation`)
** inside this sub-package, a `Segmentation` class is created, keeping reference to the nested models
** the name of the generated `Segmentation` Java class is the model name with `Segmentation` added to it in the format `model name` + `Segmentation`, first letter uppercase (e.g. `mixedMining` -> `MixedMiningSegmentation`)
** for each segment, a specific sub-package is created, whose name is the lower-cased, no space, name of the original model followed by `segment` and a progressive integer starting from 0  (e.g. `MixedMining` -> `mixedminingsegment0`, `mixedminingsegment1`, ecc. )
