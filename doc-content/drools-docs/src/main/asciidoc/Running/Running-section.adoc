= KieRuntime

== EntryPoint


The `EntryPoint` provides the methods around inserting, updating and deleting facts.
The term "entry point" is related to the fact that we have multiple partitions in a Working Memory and you can choose which one you are inserting into.
The use of multiple entry points is more common in event processing use cases, but they can be used by pure rule applications as well.

The `KieRuntime` interface provides the main interaction with the {DECISION_ENGINE}.
It is available in rule consequences and process actions.
In this manual the focus is on the methods and interfaces related to rules, and the methods pertaining to processes will be ignored for now.
But you'll notice that the `KieRuntime` inherits methods from both the `WorkingMemory` and the ``ProcessRuntime``, thereby providing a unified API to work with processes and rules.
When working with rules, three interfaces form the ``KieRuntime``: ``EntryPoint``, `WorkingMemory` and the `KieRuntime` itself.

.EntryPoint

=== Insert


In order for a fact to be evaluated against the rules in a ``KieBase``, it has to be inserted into the session.
This is done by calling the method ``insert(yourObject)``.
When a fact is inserted into the session, some of its properties might be immediately evaluated (eager evaluation) and some might be deferred for later evaluation (lazy evaluation). The exact behaviour depends on the {DECISION_ENGINE} algorithm being used.

[NOTE]
====
Expert systems typically use the term _assert_ or _assertion_ to refer to facts made available to the system.
However, due to "assert" being a keyword in most languages, we have decided to use the `insert` keyword; In this manual, the two terms are used interchangeably.
====


When an Object is inserted it returns a ``FactHandle``.
This `FactHandle` is the token used to represent your inserted object within the ``WorkingMemory``.
It is also used for interactions with the `WorkingMemory` when you wish to delete or modify an object.

[source,java]
----
Cheese stilton = new Cheese("stilton");
FactHandle stiltonHandle = ksession.insert( stilton );
----


As mentioned in the KieBase section, a Working Memory may operate in two assertion modes: either equality or identity.
Identity is the default.

_Identity_ means that the Working Memory uses an `IdentityHashMap` to store all asserted objects.
New instance assertions always result in the return of new ``FactHandle``, but if an instance is asserted again then it returns the original fact handle, i.e., it ignores repeated insertions for the same object.

_Equality_ means that the Working Memory uses a `HashMap` to store all asserted objects.
An object instance assertion will only return a new `FactHandle` if the inserted object is not equal (according to its `equal()/hashcode()` methods) to an already existing fact.

=== Delete


In order to remove a fact from the session, the method `delete()` is used.
When a fact is deleted,  any matches that are active and depend on that fact will be cancelled.
Note that it is possible to have rules that depend on the nonexistence of a fact, in which case deleting a fact may cause a rule to activate.
(See the `not` and `exists` keywords).

[NOTE]
====
Expert systems typically use the term _retract_ or _retraction_ to refer to the operation of removing facts from the Working Memory.
Drools prefers the keyword `delete` for symmetry with the keyword ``insert``; Drools also supports the keyword ``retract``, but it was deprecated in favor of ``delete``.
In this manual, the two terms are used interchangeably.
====


Retraction may be done using the `FactHandle` that was returned by the insert call.
On the right hand side of a rule the `delete` statement is used, which works with a simple object reference.

[source,java]
----
Cheese stilton = new Cheese("stilton");
FactHandle stiltonHandle = ksession.insert( stilton );
....
ksession.delete( stiltonHandle );
----

=== Update


The {DECISION_ENGINE} must be notified of modified facts, so that they can be reprocessed.
You must use the `update()` method to notify the `WorkingMemory` of changed objects for those objects that are not able to notify the `WorkingMemory` themselves.
Notice that `update()` always takes the modified object as a second parameter, which allows you to specify new instances for immutable objects.
On the right hand side of a rule the `modify` statement is recommended, as it makes the changes and notifies the {DECISION_ENGINE} in a single statement.
Alternatively, after changing a fact object's field values through calls of setter methods you must invoke `update` immediately, event before changing another fact, or you will cause problems with the indexing within the {DECISION_ENGINE}.
The modify statement avoids this problem.

[source,java]
----
Cheese stilton = new Cheese("stilton");
FactHandle stiltonHandle = workingMemory.insert( stilton );
...
stilton.setPrice( 100 );
workingMemory.update( stiltonHandle, stilton );
----

== RuleRuntime


The RuleRuntime provides access to the Agenda, permits query executions, and lets you access named Entry Points.

.RuleRuntime

=== Query


Queries are used to retrieve fact sets based on patterns, as they are used in rules.
Patterns may make use of optional parameters.
Queries can be defined in the KIE base, from where they are called up to return the matching results.
While iterating over the result collection, any identifier bound in the query can be used to access the corresponding fact or fact field by calling the `get` method with the binding variable's name as its argument.
If the binding refers to a fact object, its FactHandle can be retrieved by calling ``getFactHandle``, again with the variable's name as the parameter.

.QueryResults

.QueryResultsRow
image::UserGuide/QueryResultsRow.png[align="center"]


.Simple Query Example
====
[source,java]
----
QueryResults results =
    ksession.getQueryResults( "my query", new Object[] { "string" } );
for ( QueryResultsRow row : results ) {
    System.out.println( row.get( "varName" ) );
}
----
====

=== Live Queries


Invoking queries and processing the results by iterating over the returned set is not a good way to monitor changes over time.

To alleviate this, Drools provides Live Queries, which have a listener attached instead of returning an iterable result set.
These live queries stay open by creating a view and publishing change events for the contents of this view.
To activate, you start your query with parameters and listen to changes in the resulting view.
The `dispose` method terminates the query and discontinues this reactive scenario.

.Implementing ViewChangedEventListener
====
[source,java]
----
final List updated = new ArrayList();
final List removed = new ArrayList();
final List added = new ArrayList();

ViewChangedEventListener listener = new ViewChangedEventListener() {
 public void rowUpdated(Row row) {
  updated.add( row.get( "$price" ) );
 }

 public void rowRemoved(Row row) {
  removed.add( row.get( "$price" ) );
 }

 public void rowAdded(Row row) {
  added.add( row.get( "$price" ) );
 }
};

// Open the LiveQuery
LiveQuery query = ksession.openLiveQuery( "cheeses",
                                          new Object[] { "cheddar", "stilton" },
                                          listener );
...
...
query.dispose() // calling dispose to terminate the live query
----
====


A Drools blog article contains an example of Glazed Lists integration for live queries:

http://blog.athico.com/2010/07/glazed-lists-examples-for-drools-live.html

== StatefulRuleSession


The `StatefulRuleSession` is inherited by the `KieSession` and provides the rule related methods that are relevant from outside of the {DECISION_ENGINE}.

.StatefulRuleSession
image::UserGuide/StatefulRuleSession.png[align="center"]


=== Agenda Filters

.AgendaFilters
image::UserGuide/AgendaFilter.png[align="center"]

`
AgendaFilter` objects are optional implementations of the filter interface which are used to allow or deny the firing of a match.
What you filter on is entirely up to the implementation.
Drools 4.0 used to supply some out of the box filters, which have not be exposed in drools 5.0 knowledge-api, but they are simple to implement and the Drools 4.0 code base can be referred to.

To use a filter specify it while calling ``fireAllRules()``.
The following example permits only rules ending in the string ``"Test"``.
All others will be filtered out.

[source,java]
----
ksession.fireAllRules( new RuleNameEndsWithAgendaFilter( "Test" ) );
----

= Event Model


The event package provides means to be notified of {DECISION_ENGINE} events, including rules firing, objects being asserted, etc.
This allows you, for instance, to separate logging and auditing activities from the main part of your application (and the rules).

The `WorkingMemoryEventManager` allows for listeners to be added and removed, so that events for the working memory and the agenda can be listened to.

.WorkingMemoryEventManager
image::UserGuide/WorkingMemoryEventManager.png[align="center"]


The following code snippet shows how a simple agenda listener is declared and attached to a session.
It will print matches after they have fired.

.Adding an AgendaEventListener
====
[source,java]
----
ksession.addEventListener( new DefaultAgendaEventListener() {
   public void afterMatchFired(AfterMatchFiredEvent event) {
       super.afterMatchFired( event );
       System.out.println( event );
   }
});
----
====


Drools also provides `DebugRuleRuntimeEventListener` and `DebugAgendaEventListener` which implement each method with a debug print statement.
To print all Working Memory events, you add a listener like this:

.Adding a DebugRuleRuntimeEventListener
====
[source,java]
----
ksession.addEventListener( new DebugRuleRuntimeEventListener() );
----
====


The events currently supported are:

* MatchCreatedEvent
* MatchCancelledEvent
* BeforeMatchFiredEvent
* AfterMatchFiredEvent
* AgendaGroupPushedEvent
* AgendaGroupPoppedEvent
* ObjectInsertEvent
* ObjectDeletedEvent
* ObjectUpdatedEvent
* ProcessCompletedEvent
* ProcessNodeLeftEvent
* ProcessNodeTriggeredEvent
* ProcessStartEvent


= Rule Execution Modes


Drools provides two modes for rule execution - passive and active.

As a general guideline, Passive Mode is most suitable for {DECISION_ENGINE} applications which need to explicitly control when the {DECISION_ENGINE} shall evaluate and fire the rules, or for CEP applications making use of the Pseudo Clock. Active Mode is most effective for {DECISION_ENGINE} applications which delegate control of when rules are evaluated and fired to the {DECISION_ENGINE}, or for typical CEP application making use of the Real Time Clock.


== Passive Mode


With Passive mode not only is the user responsible for working memory operations, such as `insert()`, but also for when the rules are to evaluate the data and fire the resulting rule instantiations - using `fireAllRules()`  .

An example outline of Drools code for a CEP application making use of Passive Mode:
[source,java]
----
KieSessionConfiguration config = KieServices.Factory.get().newKieSessionConfiguration();
config.setOption( ClockTypeOption.get("pseudo") );
KieSession session = kbase.newKieSession( conf, null );
SessionPseudoClock clock = session.getSessionClock();

session.insert( tick1 );
session.fireAllRules();

clock.advanceTime(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
session.insert( tick2 );
session.fireAllRules();

clock.advanceTime(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
session.insert( tick3 );
session.fireAllRules();

session.dispose();
----


== Active Mode


Drools offers a `fireUntilHalt()` method, that starts the {DECISION_ENGINE} in Active Mode, which is asynchronous in behavior, where rules will be continually evaluated and fired, until a `halt()` call is made.

This is specially useful for CEP scenarios that require what is commonly known as "active queries".

Please note calling `fireUntilHalt()` blocks the current thread, while the {DECISION_ENGINE} will start and continue running asynchronously until the `halt()` is called on the KieSession. It is suggested therefore to call `fireUntilHalt()` from a dedicated thread, so the current thread does not get blocked indefinitely; this also enable the current thread to call `halt()` at a later stage, ref. examples below.

An example outline of Drools code for a CEP application making use of Active Mode:
[source,java]
----
KieSessionConfiguration config = KieServices.Factory.get().newKieSessionConfiguration();
config.setOption( ClockTypeOption.get("realtime") );
KieSession session = kbase.newKieSession( conf, null );

new Thread( new Runnable() {
  @Override
  public void run() {
      session.fireUntilHalt();
  }
} ).start();

session.insert( tick1 );

... Thread.sleep( 1000L ); ...

session.insert( tick2 );

... Thread.sleep( 1000L ); ...

session.insert( tick3 );

session.halt();
session.dispose();
----

NOTE: Generally, it is not recommended mixing `fireAllRules()` and `fireUntilHalt()`, especially from different threads. However the {DECISION_ENGINE} is able to handle such situations safely, thanks to the internal state machine. If `fireAllRules()` is running and a call `fireUntilHalt()` is made, the {DECISION_ENGINE} will wait until the `fireAllRules()` is finished and then start `fireUntilHalt()`. However if `fireUntilHalt()` is running and `fireAllRules()` is called, the later is ignored and will just return directly. For more details about thread-safety and the internal state machine, reference section "Improved multi-threading behaviour".


=== Performing KieSession operations atomically when in Active Mode


When in Active Mode, the {DECISION_ENGINE} is in control of when the rule shall be evaluated and fired; therefore it is important that operations on the KieSession are performed in a thread-safe manner. Additionally, from a client-side perspective, there might be the need for more than one operations to be called on the KieSession in between rule evaluations, but for engine to consider these as an atomic operation: for example, inserting more than one Fact at a given time, but for the {DECISION_ENGINE} to await until all the inserts are done, before evaluating the rules again.

Drools offers a `submit()` method to group and perform operations on the KieSession as a thread-safe atomic action, while in Active Mode.

An example outline of Drools code to perform KieSession operations atomically when in Active Mode:
[source,java]
----
KieSession session = ...;

new Thread( new Runnable() {
  @Override
  public void run() {
      session.fireUntilHalt();
  }
} ).start();

final FactHandle fh = session.insert( fact_a );

... Thread.sleep( 1000L ); ...

session.submit( new KieSession.AtomicAction() {
  @Override
  public void execute( KieSession kieSession ) {
    fact_a.setField("value");
    kieSession.update( fh, fact_a );
    kieSession.insert( fact_1 );
    kieSession.insert( fact_2 );
    kieSession.insert( fact_3 );
  }
} );

... Thread.sleep( 1000L ); ...

session.insert( fact_z );

session.halt();
session.dispose();
----

As a reminder example, the fact handle could also be retrieved from the KieSession:
[source,java]
----
...
session.insert( fact_a );

... Thread.sleep( 1000L ); ...

session.submit( new KieSession.AtomicAction() {
  @Override
  public void execute( KieSession kieSession ) {
    final FactHandle fh = kieSession.getFactHandle( fact_a );
    fact_a.setField("value");
    kieSession.update( fh, fact_a );
    kieSession.insert( fact_1 );
    kieSession.insert( fact_2 );
    kieSession.insert( fact_3 );
  }
} );

...
----


= Propagation modes


The introduction of PHREAK as default algorithm for the {DECISION_ENGINE} made the rules' evaluation lazy.
This new Drools lazy behavior allowed a relevant performance boost but, in some very specific cases, breaks the semantic of a few Drools features.

More precisely in some circumstances it is necessary to propagate the insertion of new fact into th session immediately.
For instance Drools allows a query to be executed in pull only (or passive) mode by prepending a '?' symbol to its invocation as in the following example:

.A passive query
====
[source,java]
----
query Q (Integer i)
    String( this == i.toString() )
end
rule R when
    $i : Integer()
    ?Q( $i; )
then
    System.out.println( $i );
end
----
====


In this case, since the query is passive, it shouldn't react to the insertion of a String matching the join condition in the query itself.
In other words this sequence of commands

[source,java]
----
KieSession ksession = ...
ksession.insert(1);
ksession.insert("1");
ksession.fireAllRules();
----


shouldn't cause the rule R to fire because the String satisfying the query condition has been inserted after the Integer and the passive query shouldn't react to this insertion.
Conversely the rule should fire if the insertion sequence is inverted because the insertion of the Integer, when the passive query can be satisfied by the presence of an already existing String, will trigger it.

Unfortunately the lazy nature of PHREAK doesn't allow the {DECISION_ENGINE} to make any distinction regarding the insertion sequence of the two facts, so the rule will fire in both cases.
In circumstances like this it is necessary to evaluate the rule eagerly as done by the old RETEOO-based engine.

In other cases it is required that the propagation is eager, meaning that it is not immedate, but anyway has to happen before the {DECISION_ENGINE}/agenda starts scheduled evaluations.
For instance this is necessary when a rule has the no-loop or the lock-on-active attribute and in fact when this happens this propagation mode is automatically enforced by the {DECISION_ENGINE}.

To cover these use cases, and in all other situations where an immediate or eager rule evaluation is required, it is possible to declaratively specify so by annotating the rule itself with **@Propagation(Propagation.Type)**, where Propagation.Type is an enumeration with 3 possible values:

* *IMMEDIATE* means that the propagation is performed immediately.
* *EAGER* means that the propagation is performed lazily but eagerly evaluated before scheduled evaluations.
* *LAZY* means that the propagation is totally lazy and this is default PHREAK behaviour


This means that the following drl:

.A data-driven rule using a passive query
====
[source,java]
----
query Q (Integer i)
    String( this == i.toString() )
end
rule R @Propagation(IMMEDIATE) when
    $i : Integer()
    ?Q( $i; )
then
    System.out.println( $i );
end
----
====


will make the rule R to fire if and only if the Integer is inserted after the String, thus behaving in accordance with the semantic of the passive query.

= Commands and the CommandExecutor


The `CommandFactory` allows for commands to be executed on those sessions, the only difference being that the Stateless KIE session executes `fireAllRules()` at the end before disposing the session.
The currently supported commands are:

* FireAllRules
* GetGlobal
* SetGlobal
* InsertObject
* InsertElements
* Query
* StartProcess
* BatchExecution

`
InsertObject` will insert a single object, with an optional "out" identifier. `InsertElements` will iterate an Iterable, inserting each of the elements.
What this means is that a Stateless KIE session is no longer limited to just inserting objects, it can now start processes or execute queries, and do this in any order.

.Insert Command
====
[source,java]
----
StatelessKieSession ksession = kbase.newStatelessKieSession();
ExecutionResults bresults =
  ksession.execute( CommandFactory.newInsert( new Cheese( "stilton" ), "stilton_id" ) );
Stilton stilton = bresults.getValue( "stilton_id" );
----
====


The execute method always returns an `ExecutionResults` instance, which allows access to any command results if they specify an out identifier such as the "stilton_id" above.

.InsertElements Command
====
[source,java]
----
StatelessKieSession ksession = kbase.newStatelessKieSession();
Command cmd = CommandFactory.newInsertElements( Arrays.asList( Object[] {
                  new Cheese( "stilton" ),
                  new Cheese( "brie" ),
                  new Cheese( "cheddar" ),
              });
ExecutionResults bresults = ksession.execute( cmd );
----
====


The execute method only allows for a single command.
That's where `BatchExecution` comes in, which represents a composite command, created from a list of commands.
Now, execute will iterate over the list and execute each command in turn.
This means you can insert some objects, start a process, call fireAllRules and execute a query, all in a single `execute(...)` call, which is quite powerful.

As mentioned previosly, the StatelessKieSession will execute `fireAllRules()` automatically at the end.
However the keen-eyed reader probably has already noticed the `FireAllRules` command and wondered how that works with a StatelessKieSession.
The `FireAllRules` command is allowed, and using it will disable the automatic execution at the end; think of using it as a sort of manual override function.

A custom XStream marshaller can be used with the Drools Pipeline to achieve XML scripting, which is perfect for services.
Here are two simple XML samples, one for the BatchExecution and one for the ``ExecutionResults``.

.Simple BatchExecution XML
====
[source,xml]
----
<batch-execution>
   <insert out-identifier='outStilton'>
      <org.drools.compiler.Cheese>
         <type>stilton</type>
         <price>25</price>
         <oldPrice>0</oldPrice>
      </org.drools.compiler.Cheese>
   </insert>
</batch-execution>
----
====

.Simple ExecutionResults XML
====
[source,xml]
----
<execution-results>
   <result identifier='outStilton'>
      <org.drools.compiler.Cheese>
         <type>stilton</type>
         <oldPrice>25</oldPrice>
         <price>30</price>
      </org.drools.compiler.Cheese>
   </result>
</execution-results>
----
====


Spring and Camel, covered in the integrations book, facilitate declarative services.

.BatchExecution Marshalled to XML
====
[source,xml]
----
<batch-execution>
  <insert out-identifier="stilton">
    <org.drools.compiler.Cheese>
      <type>stilton</type>
      <price>1</price>
      <oldPrice>0</oldPrice>
    </org.drools.compiler.Cheese>
  </insert>
  <query out-identifier='cheeses2' name='cheesesWithParams'>
    <string>stilton</string>
    <string>cheddar</string>
  </query>
</batch-execution>
----
====


The `CommandExecutor` returns an ``ExecutionResults``, and this is handled by the pipeline code snippet as well.
A similar output for the <batch-execution> XML sample above would be:

.ExecutionResults Marshalled to XML
====
[source,xml]
----
<execution-results>
  <result identifier="stilton">
    <org.drools.compiler.Cheese>
      <type>stilton</type>
      <price>2</price>
    </org.drools.compiler.Cheese>
  </result>
  <result identifier='cheeses2'>
    <query-results>
      <identifiers>
        <identifier>cheese</identifier>
      </identifiers>
      <row>
        <org.drools.compiler.Cheese>
          <type>cheddar</type>
          <price>2</price>
          <oldPrice>0</oldPrice>
        </org.drools.compiler.Cheese>
      </row>
      <row>
        <org.drools.compiler.Cheese>
          <type>cheddar</type>
          <price>1</price>
          <oldPrice>0</oldPrice>
        </org.drools.compiler.Cheese>
      </row>
    </query-results>
  </result>
</execution-results>
----
====


The `BatchExecutionHelper` provides a configured XStream instance to support the marshalling of Batch Executions, where the resulting XML can be used as a message format, as shown above.
Configured converters only exist for the commands supported via the Command Factory.
The user may add other converters for their user objects.
This is very useful for scripting stateless or stateful KIE sessions, especially when services are involved.

There is currently no XML schema to support schema validation.
The basic format is outlined here, and the drools-pipeline module has an illustrative unit test in the `XStreamBatchExecutionTest` unit test.
The root element is <batch-execution> and it can contain zero or more commands elements.

.Root XML element
====
[source,xml]
----
<batch-execution>
...
</batch-execution>
----
====


This contains a list of elements that represent commands, the supported commands is limited to those Commands provided by the Command Factory.
The most basic of these is the <insert> element, which inserts objects.
The contents of the insert element is the user object, as dictated by XStream.

.Insert
====
[source,xml]
----
<batch-execution>
   <insert>
      ...<!-- any user object -->
   </insert>
</batch-execution>
----
====


The insert element features an "out-identifier" attribute, demanding that the inserted object will also be returned as part of the result payload.

.Insert with Out Identifier Command
====
[source,xml]
----
<batch-execution>
   <insert out-identifier='userVar'>
      ...
   </insert>
</batch-execution>
----
====


It's also possible to insert a collection of objects using the <insert-elements> element.
This command does not support an out-identifier.
The `org.domain.UserClass` is just an illustrative user object that XStream would serialize.

.Insert Elements command
====
[source,xml]
----
<batch-execution>
   <insert-elements>
      <org.domain.UserClass>
         ...
      </org.domain.UserClass>
      <org.domain.UserClass>
         ...
      </org.domain.UserClass>
      <org.domain.UserClass>
         ...
      </org.domain.UserClass>
   </insert-elements>
</batch-execution>
----
====


While the `out` attribute is useful in returning specific instances as a result payload, we often wish to run actual queries.
Both parameter and parameterless queries are supported.
The `name` attribute is the name of the query to be called, and the `out-identifier` is the identifier to be used for the query results in the `<execution-results>` payload.

.Query Command
====
[source,xml]
----
<batch-execution>
   <query out-identifier='cheeses' name='cheeses'/>
   <query out-identifier='cheeses2' name='cheesesWithParams'>
      <string>stilton</string>
      <string>cheddar</string>
   </query>
</batch-execution>

= KieSessions pool

In high volume use cases `KieSession`s get created and disposed with a very high frequency. In general this operation is not
extremely time consuming, but when repeated millions of times can become a bottleneck and also requires a huge GC effort.
It is possible to greatly alleviate this problem by using a pool of `KieSession`s. To obtain such a pool from a `KieContainer`
is enough to invoke on it the method

[source]
----
KieContainerSessionsPool KieContainer.newKieSessionsPool(int initialSize)
----

where `initialSize` is the number of the `KieSession`s that will be initially created in the pool. However, if required by the running
application, the number of `KieSession`s in the pool will dynamically grow beyond that value. At this point you can create
`KieSession`s from that pool as you would normally do from a `KieContainer`:

[source]
----
KieContainerSessionsPool pool = kContainer.newKieSessionsPool(10);
KieSession kSession = pool.newKieSession();
----

Now you can use the KieSession as per normal, and when you call `dispose()` on it, instead of being destroyed, it just
gets resetted and pushed back into the pool. Note that using this pool will also affect the case when you have one or more
`StatelessKieSession`s and you keep reusing them with multiple call to the `execute()` method. In fact a  `StatelessKieSession`
created directly from a `KieContainer` will keep to internally create a new `KieSession` for each `execute()` invocation.
Conversely if you create the `StatelessKieSession` from the pool it will internally uses the `KieSession`s provided by the
pool itself. In other words even if you asked a `StatelessKieSession` to the pool, what is actually pooled are the `KieSession`s
that are wrapped by it.

Once you're done with the pool it is required that you call the `shutdown()` method on it to avoid memory leaks. Alternatively
calling `dispose()` on the whole `KieContainer` will also automatically shutdown all the pools eventually created from it.
