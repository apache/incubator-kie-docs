== Introduction

KIE (Knowledge Is Everything) is an umbrella project introduced to bring our related technologies together under one roof.
It also acts as the core shared between our projects.

KIE contains the following different but related projects offering a complete portfolio of solutions for business
automation and management:

1. *Drools* is a business-rule management system with a forward-chaining and backward-chaining inference-based rules engine,
allowing fast and reliable evaluation of business rules and complex event processing. A rules engine is also a fundamental
building block to create an expert system which, in artificial intelligence, is a computer system that emulates the decision-making
ability of a human expert.
2. *jBPM* is a flexible Business Process Management suite allowing you to model your business goals by describing
the steps that need to be executed to achieve those goals.
3. *OptaPlanner* is a constraint solver that optimizes use cases such as employee rostering, vehicle routing, task assignment
and cloud optimization.
4. *{CENTRAL}* is is a full featured web application for the visual composition of custom business rules and processes.
5. *UberFire* is a web-based workbench framework inspired by Eclipse Rich Client Platform.

The 7.x series will follow a more agile approach with more regular and iterative releases. We plan to do some bigger changes than normal for a series of minor releases, and users need to be aware those are coming before adopting.

1. UI sections and links will become object oriented, rather than task oriented. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_user_interface
2. Authoring/Library will become project oriented, rather than repository oriented. You'll create, browse and open projects rather than repositories. The repository concept will be pushed lower, for instance it'll be created automaticaly when you create the projcet.
3. The old form modeller will be removed and only the new one made available. Although old forms will continue to render.
4. The new designer will continue to mature with more nodes and improved UXD. Eventually it'll become the default editor, but we will not remove the old one until there is feature parity in BPMN2 support.
5. Continued UXD improvements in lots of places.
6. We will introduce the AppFormer project, this will be a re-org and consolidation of existing projects and result in some artifact renames. UberFire will become AppFormer-Core, forms, data modeller and dashbuilder will come under AppFormer. Dashbuilder will most likely becalled Appformer-Insight.

The 8.x series will come towards the end of this year. We have ongoing parallel work to introduce concepts of workspaces with improved git support, that will have a built in workflow for forking and pull requests. This will be combined with horizontal scaling and improved high availability. These changes are important for usability and cloud scalability, but too much of a change for a minor release, hence the bump to 8.x
