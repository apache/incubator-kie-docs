== Credit dispute process

The following credit dispute process example is intended to show a simple use case where you can use the "skills" configuration to influence the way tasks are assigned according to the solver constraints and the process data.

.Credit dispute process

=== Process start

When the process starts, the user is asked to complete the information in the following image.
In particular, the credit card brand for which the dispute is related to and the preferred language for receiving the process notifications are requested.
This information is used for assigning the process tasks.

.Start credit dispute process form

=== Process configuration

The following image shows the process variables that are used for holding the card brand and language respectively.

.Credit dispute process variables
image::KieServerTaskAssigning/CreditDisputeProcessWithVariables.png[]

The process start form populates these variables with the user inputs.

=== Resolve dispute task configuration

The following image shows the ResolveDispute task configuration, which establishes that the task input parameter skills is assigned with the value of the process variable cardType.

.Resolve dispute task configuration
image::KieServerTaskAssigning/ResolveDisputeTaskConfiguration.png[]

With this configuration, {PLANNER} assigns this task to users that meet the following criteria:

. Are in the user group CreditAnalyst
. Have all of the skills configured in the task input parameter skills


=== Notify customer task configuration

The following image shows the NotifyCustomer task configuration, which establishes that the task input parameter skills is assigned with the value of the process variable language.

.Notify customer task configuration
image::KieServerTaskAssigning/NotifyCustomerTaskConfiguration.png[]

With this configuration {PLANNER} assigns this task to users that meet the following criteria:

. Are in the group ClientRelations
. Have all of the skills configured in the task input parameter skills
. Note that in this case the language selection is optional since the form field is not marked with "*" <<Process start, see the process start form>>, meaning that when no language is selected the task won’t have any configured skills.
This implies that in such cases whatever users that are in group ClientRelations can be assigned to the task.

=== Process execution (example users)

Let’s assume that the following users configurations are used for executing the process.

**users.properties file:**

[source, java]
----
john=analyst,admin,user,Accounting,PM,ClientRelations
mary=analyst,admin,user,ClientRelations
katy=analyst,admin,user,HR,CreditAnalyst
maciek=admin,analyst,user,PM,HR,CreditAnalyst
----

**skills.properties file:**

[source, java]
----
john=ES,EN                     (has skills in the Spanish and English languages)
mary=ZH                        (has skills in the Chinese language)
katy=CITI,MASTER               (has skills in the CITI and MASTER cards)
maciek=VISA,AMERICAN_EXPRESS   (has skills in the VISA and AMERICAN EXPRESS cards)
----

=== Process execution (example instances)

With the preceding configurations the following execution scenarios are expected:

**Process instance #1:**

1) Start process

.Start credit dispute process instance #1
image::KieServerTaskAssigning/StartCreditDisputeInstance1Simple.png[]

2) ResolveDispute task

.Resolve dispute task for process instance #1
image::KieServerTaskAssigning/ResolveDisputeTaskForProcessInstance1WasCreated.png[]

The ResolveDispute task is assigned to the user maciek since it requires VISA skills.

[NOTE]
====
In real environments there might be many users with this skill. In this case {PLANNER} assigns the new created task considering the optimized plan, which means that depending on the workload a different user could have been assigned.
====

3) NotifyCustomer task

.Notify customer task for process instance #1
image::KieServerTaskAssigning/NotifyCustomerTaskForProcessInstance1WasCreated.png[]

When the ResolveDispute task is completed, a new task NotifyCustomer is created and assigned to the user john because that task requires skills in Spanish.

**Process instance #2:**

1) Start process

.Start credit dispute process instance #2
image::KieServerTaskAssigning/StartCreditDisputeInstance2Simple.png[]

2) ResolveDispute task

.Resolve dispute task for process instance #2
image::KieServerTaskAssigning/ResolveDisputeTaskForProcessInstance2WasCreated.png[]

The ResolveDispute task is assigned to the user katy since it requires CITI skills.

3) NotifyCustomer task

.Notify customer task for process instance #2
image::KieServerTaskAssigning/NotifyCustomerTaskForProcessInstance2WasCreated.png[]

When the ResolveDispute task is completed, a new task NotifyCustomer is created and assigned to the user mary because that task requires skills in Chinese.

**Process instance #3:**

1) Start process

.Start credit dispute process instance #3
image::KieServerTaskAssigning/StartCreditDisputeInstance3Simple.png[]

2) ResolveDispute task

.Resolve dispute task for process instance #3
image::KieServerTaskAssigning/ResolveDisputeTaskForProcessInstance3WasCreated.png[]

The ResolveDispute task is assigned to the user katy because that task requires skills in the MASTER card.

3) NotifyCustomer task

.Notify customer task for process instance #3
image::KieServerTaskAssigning/NotifyCustomerTaskForProcessInstance3WasCreated.png[]

When the ResolveDispute task is completed, a new task NotifyCustomer is created and assigned to the planninguser because none of the users has the required skills in Hindi.
In this case, an external interaction is required to determine the best suited user to complete the task. The planinguser must perform this action by delegating the task.

[NOTE]
====
The planninguser assignment is used to cover edge cases and should not be part of the modelling strategy.
In the preceding example, if it is known that no user will have skills in Hindi. A similar but softer constraint can be configured by using affinities.

== Customized User System Service

For creating a custom user system service implementation follow these steps:

1) Create a KJAR project structure

2) Add the following dependency

[source, xml]
----
<dependency>
  <!-- Kie Server, OptaPlanner, or any other product dependencies must use provided scope -->
  <groupId>org.kie.server</groupId>
    <artifactId>kie-server-services-task-assigning-user-system-api</artifactId>
    <version>configure the proper version number aligned with the target kie-server</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
----

3) Provide your UserSystemService implementation, see the following example:

[source, java]
----
public class MyDBUserSystemService implements UserSystemService {

    private DataSource dataSource;

    public String getName() {
        return "MyDBUserSystemService";
    }

    public void start() {
        String dataSourceName = System.getProperty("org.example.DBUserSystemService.ds",
                                                   "java:jboss/datasources/ExampleDS");
        try {
            InitialContext initialContext = new InitialContext();
            dataSource = (DataSource) initialContext.lookup(dataSourceName);
        } catch (NamingException e) {
             // throw an exception if there are unrecoverable errors that prevent
             // the service to start.
            throw new DBUserSystemServiceException("Unable to find data source under name " +
                                                   dataSourceName, e);
       }
    }

    public void test() throws Exception {
         // test your database queries etc.
    }

    public List<User> findAllUsers() {
        try (Connection conn = dataSource.getConnection()) {
            List<User> myUsers;
            // query the users information from the database.
           return myUsers;
       } catch (SQLException e) {
           throw new DBUserSystemServiceException("An error was produced finding all users: " +
                                                  e.getMessage(), e);
       }
   }

    public User findUser(String userId) {
        if (userId == null) {
            return null;
        }
        try (Connection conn = dataSource.getConnection()) {
            User user;
            // query the user information from the database.
            return user;
        } catch (SQLException e) {
          throw new DBUserSystemServiceException("An error was produced finding user: "+
                                                  e.getMessage(), e);
        }
    }
}
----

4) Add the following resource to the project and declare your user system service provider class on it.

[source, java]
----
src/main/resources/META-INF/services/org.kie.server.services.taskassigning.user.system.api.UserSystemService

org.example.MyDBUserSystemService
----

Finally for using it in the <<Planning kie-server, Planning kie-server>> follow these steps:


1) Build your KJAR and be sure the corresponding maven generated artifact is installed in the maven repository used by your <<Planning kie-server, Planning kie-server>>.

2) Add a datasource configuration to your <<Planning kie-server, Planning kie-server>> pointing to the target DB
(this step is only required for the example above)
For example with JNDI name java:jboss/datasources/db-user-system-datasource

3) Finally add the following items to the <<Planning kie-server, Planning kie-server>> configuration file:

[source, xml]
----
<server>
...
<system-properties>
  <property name="org.kie.server.taskAssigning.userSystem.name"
            value="MyDBUserSystemService" />
  <property name="org.kie.server.taskAssigning.userSystem.container.id"
            value="my-db-user-system-container" />
  <property name="org.kie.server.taskAssigning.userSystem.container.groupId"
            value="your KJARs groupId" />
  <property name="org.kie.server.taskAssigning.userSystem.container.artifactId"
            value="your KJARs artifactId" />
  <property name="org.kie.server.taskAssigning.userSystem.container.version"
            value="your KJARs version number" />
  <property name="org.example.DBUserSystemService.ds"
            value="java:jboss/datasources/db-user-system-datasource" />
</system-properties>
...
</server>
----
