= Deploying an EJB services WAR file

You can use the Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) interface to create and deploy an EJB services WAR file that you want to use as part of your {PRODUCT} distribution.

.Procedure

. Register a human task callback using a startup Java class, such as the following example:
+
[source]
----
@Singleton
@Startup
public class StartupBean {

  @PostConstruct
  public void init()
  { System.setProperty("org.jbpm.ht.callback", "jaas"); }

}
----

. Build your EJB project to generate the WAR file according to your project configuration.
. Deploy the generated file on the {EAP} instance where {PRODUCT} is running.
+
--
Avoid using the `Singleton` strategy for your runtime sessions. The `Singleton` strategy can cause applications to load the same `ksession` instance multiple times from the underlying file system and cause optimistic lock exceptions.

If you want to deploy the EJB WAR file on a {EAP} instance separate from the one where {PRODUCT} is running, configure your application or the application server to invoke a remote EJB and to propagate the security context.

If you are using Hibernate to create a database schema for {PRODUCT}, update the `persistence.xml` file in {CENTRAL} and set the value of the `hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto` property to `update` instead of `create`.
--
. Test the deployment locally by creating a basic web application and injecting the EJB services, as shown in the following example:
+
[source]
----
@EJB(lookup = "ejb:/sample-war-ejb-app/ProcessServiceEJBImpl!org.jbpm.services.ejb.api.ProcessServiceEJBRemote")
private ProcessServiceEJBRemote processService;

@EJB(lookup = "ejb:/sample-war-ejb-app/UserTaskServiceEJBImpl!org.jbpm.services.ejb.api.UserTaskServiceEJBRemote")
private UserTaskServiceEJBRemote userTaskService;

@EJB(lookup = "ejb:/sample-war-ejb-app/RuntimeDataServiceEJBImpl!org.jbpm.services.ejb.api.RuntimeDataServiceEJBRemote")
private RuntimeDataServiceEJBRemote runtimeDataService;
----
