= Creating a Kie Container


Once your Execution Server is registered, you can start adding *Kie Containers* to it.

*Kie Containers* are self contained environments that have been provisioned to hold instances of your packaged and deployed rule instances.



. Start by clicking the *\+* icon next to the Execution Server where you want to deploy your Container. This will bring up the New Container screen.
. If you know the **Group Name**, *Artifact Id* and *Version* (GAV) of your deployed package, then you can enter those details and click the Ok button to select that instance (and provide a name for the Container);
. If you don't know these values, you can search {CENTRAL} for all packages that can be deployed. Click the *Search* button without entering any value in the search field (you can narrow your search by entering any term that you know exists in the package that you want to deploy).

The figure above shows that there are three deployable packages available to be used as containers on the Execution Server.
Select the one that you want by clicking the Select button.
This will auto-populate the *GAV* and you can then click the *Ok* button to use this deployable as the new Container.
. Enter a name for this Container at the top and then press the Ok button.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Container name must be unique inside each execution server and must not contain any spaces.

[NOTE]
====
Just below the *GAV* row, you will see an uneditable row that shows you the *URL* for your Container against which you will be able to execute REST commands.
