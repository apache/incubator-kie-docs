The following are some of the Java client services available in the `org.kie.server.client` package of your {PRODUCT} distribution. You can use these services to interact with related resources in {KIE_SERVER} similarly to the {KIE_SERVER} REST API.

* `KieServicesClient`: Used as the entry point for other {KIE_SERVER} Java clients, and used to interact with KIE containers
* `JobServicesClient`: Used to schedule, cancel, re-queue, and get job requests
* `RuleServicesClient`: Used to send commands to the server to perform rule-related operations, such as executing rules or inserting objects into the KIE session
* `SolverServicesClient`: Used to perform all {PLANNER} operations, such as getting the solver state and the best solution, or disposing a solver
ifdef::PAM,JBPM[]
* `ProcessServicesClient`: Used to start, signal, and abort processes or work items
* `QueryServicesClient`: Used to query processes, process nodes, and process variables
* `UserTaskServicesClient`: Used to perform all user-task operations, such as starting, claiming, or canceling a task, and to query tasks by a specified field, such as by user or by process instances ID
* `UIServicesClient`: Used to get String representation of forms (XML or JSON) and of a process image (SVG)
* `ProcessAdminServicesClient`: Provides an interface for operations with process instances (found in `~/org/kie/server/client/admin`)
