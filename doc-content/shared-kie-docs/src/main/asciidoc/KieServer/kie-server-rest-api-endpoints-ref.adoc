= Supported {KIE_SERVER} REST API endpoints

The {KIE_SERVER} REST API provides endpoints for the following types of resources in {PRODUCT}:

* {KIE_SERVER} and KIE containers
* KIE session assets (for runtime commands)
* DMN assets
* Planning solvers
ifdef::PAM,JBPM[]
* Processes
* Process images
* Process and task forms
* Tasks
* Cases
* Documents
* Jobs
* Queries for processes, tasks, and cases
* Custom queries
endif::PAM,JBPM[]

The {KIE_SERVER} REST API base URL is `\http://SERVER:PORT/kie-server/services/rest/`. All requests require HTTP Basic authentication or token-based authentication for the `kie-server` user role.

For the full list of {KIE_SERVER} REST API endpoints and descriptions, use one of the following resources:

* http://jbpm.org/learn/documentation.html[Execution Server REST API] on the jBPM Documentation page (static)
* Swagger UI for the {KIE_SERVER} REST API at `\http://SERVER:PORT/kie-server/docs` (dynamic, requires running {KIE_SERVER})

== Endpoint requirements

Note the following requirements for some of the {KIE_SERVER} REST API endpoints:

* *Process images:* For API access to process images, the system property `<storesvgonsave enabled="true"/>` must be configured for your {PRODUCT} project in `$SERVER_HOME/standalone/deployments/{URL_COMPONENT_CENTRAL}.war/org.kie.workbench.KIEWebapp/profiles/jbpm.xml`. This property is set to `true` by default. If the API is not working with process images, set it to `true` in the file, restart your {KIE_SERVER}, modify the relevant process and save it, and then build and deploy your project. This property enables SVG images to be stored so that they can be retrieved by the {KIE_SERVER} REST API.

* *Custom queries:* Some custom query requests with the {KIE_SERVER} REST API require a query `mapper` definition to map the query results to concrete objects. You can implement your own query result mappers or use the mappers provided with {PRODUCT}. The query mappers in {PRODUCT} are similar to other object-relational mapping (ORM) providers, such as Hibernate, which maps tables to entities. For example, you can use the `org.jbpm.kie.services.impl.query.mapper.ProcessInstanceQueryMapper`, also registered as `ProcessInstances`, in custom query endpoints for returning process instance data.
