= Securing password using key store

KIE server is using for some communication (e.g. REST api) basic authentication with passwords. From a security perspective it is not safe to store such passwords in clear text form on the disc. For this purpose a mechanism was developed to store passwords in a key store and then use it in the application.

== Simple use case

User wants to secure his password for communicating via REST client. He creates new keystore where he will put his password, he will setup system variables with the info to the keystore and KIE will automatically load the keystore and will use the password for securing the communication.

== Implementation and business logic

Current implementation is using key store if it is defined. If not, the functionality is falling back to old behavior using config parameters.

== System requirements

To use a key store we need to create it first. As JKS is not supporting symmetric keys we have to create JCEKS key store. Moreover, password can be stored in a key store only for Java 8 and above. For generating a key store you can use standard tool KeyTool which is part of JDK installation.

== Initialization of a key store

For keystore initialization we recommend to use keytool. Syntax is the following: +
[source,bash]
----
${JAVA_HOME}/bin/keytool -importpassword -keystore _keystore_url_ -keypass _alias_key_password_ -alias _password_alias_ -storepass _keystore_password_ -storetype JCEKS
----

 * *alias* - alias name of the entry to process
 * *keypass* - key password
 * *keystore* - keystore name
 * *storepass* - keystore password
 * *storetype* - keystore type

After running this command user will be asked to enter the password which he wants to store.

== System parameters for loading key store

 * *kie.keystore.keyStoreURL* - URL to a keystore which should be used
 * *kie.keystore.keyStorePwd* - password to a keystore
 * *kie.keystore.key.server.alias* - alias of the key for REST services where password is stored
 * *kie.keystore.key.server.pwd* - password of an alias for REST services with stored password
 * *kie.keystore.key.ctrl.alias* - alias of the key for default REST {CONTROLLER} where password is stored
 * *kie.keystore.key.ctrl.pwd* - password of an alias for default REST {CONTROLLER} with stored password

== Example

. create user and password in application server (it has to have kie-server role)
[source,bash]
----
${EAP_HOME}/add-user.sh -a -e -u kieserver -p "kiePassword1!" -g kie-server
----

[start=2]
. use key tool to create keystore with password in it +

[source,bash]
----
${JAVA_HOME}/bin/keytool -importpassword -keystore /home/kie/keystores/droolsServer.jceks -keypass keypwd -alias droolsKey -storepass serverpwd -storetype JCEKS

Enter the password to be stored:
Re-enter password:

${JAVA_HOME}/bin/keytool -importpassword -keystore /home/kie/keystores/droolsServer.jceks -keypass keypwd -alias restKey -storepass serverpwd -storetype JCEKS

Enter the password to be stored:
Re-enter password:

----

[start=3]
. set following system properties on application server that will let the KIE Server or {CONTROLLER} to read password from keystore
[source,xml]
----
    <system-properties>
        <property name="kie.keystore.keyStoreURL" value="file:///home/kie/keystores/droolsServer.jceks"/>
        <property name="kie.keystore.keyStorePwd" value="serverpwd"/>
        <property name="kie.keystore.key.server.alias" value="restKey"/>
        <property name="kie.keystore.key.server.pwd" value="keypwd"/>
        <property name="kie.keystore.key.ctrl.alias" value="droolsKey"/>
        <property name="kie.keystore.key.ctrl.pwd" value="keypwd"/>
    </system-properties>
----

[start=4]
. start server to verify configuration
