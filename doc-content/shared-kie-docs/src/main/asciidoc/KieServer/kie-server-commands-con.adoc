[id='kie-server-commands-con_{context}']
= {KIE_SERVER} and KIE container commands in {PRODUCT}

{PRODUCT} supports server commands that you can send to {KIE_SERVER} for server-related or container-related operations, such as retrieving server information or creating or deleting a container. The full list of supported {KIE_SERVER} configuration commands is located in the `org.kie.server.api.commands` package in your {PRODUCT} instance.

In the {KIE_SERVER} REST API, you use the `org.kie.server.api.commands` commands as the request body for `POST` requests to `\http://SERVER:PORT/kie-server/services/rest/server/config`. For more information about using the {KIE_SERVER} REST API, see xref:kie-server-rest-api-con_kie-apis[].

In the {KIE_SERVER} Java client API, you use the corresponding method in the parent `KieServicesClient` Java client as an embedded API request in your Java application. All {KIE_SERVER} commands are executed by methods provided in the Java client API, so you do not need to embed the actual {KIE_SERVER} commands in your Java application. For more information about using the {KIE_SERVER} Java client API, see xref:kie-server-java-api-con_kie-apis[].
