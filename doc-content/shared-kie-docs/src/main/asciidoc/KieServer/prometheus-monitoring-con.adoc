= Prometheus metrics monitoring in {PRODUCT}

Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring toolkit that you can use with {PRODUCT} to collect and store metrics related to the execution of business rules, processes, Decision Model and Notation (DMN) models, and other {PRODUCT} assets. You can access the stored metrics through a REST API call to the {KIE_SERVER}, through the Prometheus expression browser, or using a data-graphing tool such as Grafana.

You can configure Prometheus metrics monitoring for an on-premise {KIE_SERVER} instance, for {KIE_SERVER} on Spring Boot, or for a {KIE_SERVER} deployment on {OPENSHIFT}.

For the list of available metrics that {KIE_SERVER} exposes with Prometheus,
