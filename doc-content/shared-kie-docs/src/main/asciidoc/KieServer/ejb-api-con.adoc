= EJB API for KIE sessions and task services

{PRODUCT} provides an Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) API that you can use for embedded use cases to access `KieSession` and `TaskService` objects remotely from an application. The EJB API enables close transaction integration between the {PROCESS_ENGINE} in {PRODUCT} and remote customer applications.

Although {KIE_SERVER} does not support EJB, you can use EJB as a remote protocol for the {PROCESS_ENGINE} similar to remote REST or JMS operations with {KIE_SERVER}.

The implementation of the EJB interface is a single framework-independent and container-agnostic API that you can use with framework-specific code. The EJB services are exposed through the `org.jbpm.services.api` and `org.jbpm.services.ejb` packages in {PRODUCT}. The implementation does not support the `RuleService` class, but the `ProcessService` class exposes an `execute` method that enables you to use various rule-related commands, such as `InsertCommand` and `FireAllRulesCommand`.

NOTE: Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI) is also supported through the `org.jbpm.services.cdi` package in {PRODUCT}. However, to avoid conflicts in your EJB integration, do not use EJB and CDI together.
