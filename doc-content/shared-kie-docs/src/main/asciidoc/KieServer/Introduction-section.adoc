= Overview


_{KIE_SERVER}_ is a modular, standalone server component that can be used to instantiate and execute rules and processes.
It exposes this functionality via REST, JMS and Java interfaces to client application.
It also provides seamless integration with the __{CENTRAL}__.

At its core, _{KIE_SERVER}_ is a configurable web application packaged as a WAR file.
Distributions are available for pure web containers (like Tomcat) and for JEE 6 and JEE 7 containers.

Most capabilities on the Kie Server are configurable, and based on the concepts of extensions.
Each extension can be enabled/disabled independently, allowing the user to configure the server to its need.

The current version of the Kie Server ships with two default extensions:

* BRM: provides support for the execution of Business Rules using the {DECISION_ENGINE}.
* BPM: provides support for the execution of Business Processes using the {PROCESS_ENGINE}. It supports:
** process execution
** task execution
** asynchronous job execution


Both extensions enabled by default, but can be disabled by setting the corresponding property (see configuration chapter for details).

This server was designed to have a low footprint, with minimal memory consumption, and therefore, to be easily deployable on a cloud environment.
Each instance of this server can open and instantiate multiple _Kie Containers_ which allows you to execute multiple services in parallel.

== Glossary

* **Kie Server**: execution server purely focusing on providing runtime environment for both rules and processes. These capabilities are provided by __Kie Server Extensions__. More capabilities can be added by further extensions (e.g. customer could add his own extensions in case of missing functionality that will then use infrastructure of the KIE Server). A Kie Server instance is a standalone Kie Server executing on a given application server/web container. A Kie Server instantiates and provides support for multiple Kie Containers.
* **Kie Server Extension**: a "plugin" for the Kie Server that adds capabilities to the server. The Kie Server ships with two default kie server extensions: BRM and BPM.
* **Kie Container**: an in-memory instantiation of a kjar, allowing for the instantiation and usage of its assets (domain models, processes, rules, etc). A Kie Server exposes Kie Containers through a standard API over transport protocols like REST and JMS.
* **Controller**: a server-backed REST endpoint that will be responsible for managing KIE Server instances. Such end point must provide following capabilities:
+
** respond to connect requests
** sync all registered containers on the corresponding _Kie Server ID_
** respond to disconnect requests
* **Kie Server state**: currently known state of given Kie Server instance. This is a local storage (by default in file) that maintains the following information:
+
** list of registered {CONTROLLER}s
** list of known containers
** kie server configuration
+
The server state is persisted upon receival of events like: _Kie Container_ created, _Kie Container_ is disposed, {CONTROLLER} accepts registration of _Kie Server_ instance, etc.

* **Kie Server ID**: an arbitrary assigned identifier to which configurations are assigned. At boot, each Kie Server Instance is assigned an ID, and that ID is matched to a configuration on the {CONTROLLER}. The Kie Server Instance fetches and uses that configuration to setup itself.
