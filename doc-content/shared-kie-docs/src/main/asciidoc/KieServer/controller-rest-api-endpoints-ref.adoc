= Supported {CONTROLLER} REST API endpoints

The {CONTROLLER} REST API provides endpoints for interacting with {KIE_SERVER} templates (configurations), {KIE_SERVER} instances (remote servers), and associated KIE containers (deployment units). The {CONTROLLER} REST API base URL is `\http://SERVER:PORT/CONTROLLER/rest/`. All requests require HTTP Basic authentication or token-based authentication for the `rest-all` user role if you installed {CENTRAL} and you want to use the built-in {CONTROLLER}, or the `kie-server` user role if you installed the {HEADLESS_CONTROLLER} separately from {CENTRAL}.

For the full list of {CONTROLLER} REST API endpoints and descriptions, see the http://jbpm.org/learn/documentation.html[Controller REST API] resources on the jBPM Documentation page.
