= Creating our Camel Context


We need to create our own CamelContext to start.
The first thing that we should do is create and register the grid node that we are going to use inside the CamelContext.
In the most common cases we need to implement the Local grid connection.
The next step after the LocalConnection creation is to get a new ExecutionNode and register this inside the CamelContext.

[source,java]
----
LocalConnection connection = new LocalConnection();
ExecutionNode node = connection.getExecutionNode();
node.setId("node");
Context jndiContext = new JndiContext();
jndiContext.bind("node", node);
CamelContext camelContext = new DefaultCamelContext(jndiContext);
----


After this code, we have a properly configured CamelContext with all the configurations to use a DroolsComponent.
However, before we are ready to execute Drools, we need to configure Camel entry points.
