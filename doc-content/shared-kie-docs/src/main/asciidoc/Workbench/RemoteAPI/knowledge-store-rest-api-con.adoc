= Knowledge Store REST API for {CENTRAL} spaces and projects

{PRODUCT} provides a Knowledge Store REST API that you can use to interact with your projects and spaces in {PRODUCT} without using the {CENTRAL} user interface. The Knowledge Store is the artifact repository for assets in {PRODUCT}. This API support enables you to facilitate and automate maintenance of {CENTRAL} projects and spaces.

With the Knowledge Store REST API, you can perform the following actions:

* Retrieve information about all projects and spaces
* Create, update, or delete projects and spaces
* Build, deploy, and test projects
* Retrieve information about previous Knowledge Store REST API requests, or _jobs_

Knowledge Store REST API requests require the following components:

Authentication::
The Knowledge Store REST API requires HTTP Basic authentication or token-based authentication for the user role `rest-all`. To view configured user roles for your {PRODUCT} distribution, navigate to `~/$SERVER_HOME/standalone/configuration/application-roles.properties` and `~/application-users.properties`.
+
--
To add a user with the `rest-all` role, navigate to `~/$SERVER_HOME/bin` and run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
$ ./add-user.sh -a --user <USERNAME> --password <PASSWORD> --role rest-all
