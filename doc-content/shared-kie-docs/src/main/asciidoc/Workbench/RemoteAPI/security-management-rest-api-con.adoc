= Security Management REST API for {CENTRAL} groups, roles, and users

{PRODUCT} provides a Security Management REST API that you can use to manage the groups, roles, and users in {PRODUCT} without using the {CENTRAL} user interface. This API support enables you to facilitate and automate management of {CENTRAL} groups, roles, users, and granted permissions.

With the Security Management REST API, you can perform the following actions:

* Retrieve information about all groups, roles, users, and their granted permissions
* Create, update, or delete groups and users
* Update granted permissions for groups, roles, and users
* Retrieve information about groups and roles assigned to the users

Security Management REST API requests require the following components:

Authentication::
The Security Management REST API requires HTTP Basic authentication or token-based authentication for the user role `admin`. To view configured user roles for your {PRODUCT} distribution, navigate to `~/$SERVER_HOME/standalone/configuration/application-roles.properties` and `~/application-users.properties`.
+
--
To add a user with the `admin` role, navigate to `~/$SERVER_HOME/bin` and run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
$ ./add-user.sh -a --user <USERNAME> --password <PASSWORD> --role admin
