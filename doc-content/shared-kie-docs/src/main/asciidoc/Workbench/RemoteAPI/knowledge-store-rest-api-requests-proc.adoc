= Sending requests with the Knowledge Store REST API using a REST client or curl utility

The Knowledge Store REST API enables you to interact with your projects and spaces in {PRODUCT} without using the {CENTRAL} user interface. You can send Knowledge Store REST API requests using any REST client or curl utility.

.Prerequisites
* {CENTRAL} is installed and running.
* You have `rest-all` user role access to {CENTRAL}.

.Procedure
. Identify the relevant xref:knowledge-store-rest-api-endpoints-ref_kie-apis[API endpoint] to which you want to send a request, such as `[GET] /spaces` to retrieve spaces in {CENTRAL}.
. In a REST client or curl utility, enter the following components for a `GET` request to `/spaces`. Adjust any request details according to your use case.

* *Authentication*: Enter the user name and password of the {CENTRAL} user with the `rest-all` role.
* *HTTP Headers*: Set the following header:
** `Accept`: `application/json`
* *HTTP method*: Set to `GET`.
* *URL*: Enter the Knowledge Store REST API base URL and endpoint, such as `\http://localhost:8080/{URL_COMPONENT_CENTRAL}/rest/spaces`.


For curl utility:

* `-u`: Enter the user name and password of the {CENTRAL} user with the `rest-all` role.
* `-H`: Set the following header:
** `Accept`: `application/json`
