= Jobs (API requests)

All `POST` and `DELETE` requests in the Knowledge Store REST API return a job ID associated with each request, in addition to the returned request details. You can use a job ID to view the request status or delete a sent request.

Knowledge Store REST API requests, or _jobs_, can have the following statuses:

.Job statuses (API request statuses)
[cols="1,3a", frame="all", options="header"]
|===
|Status
|Description

|`ACCEPTED`
|The request was accepted and is being processed.

|`BAD_REQUEST`
|The request contained incorrect content and was not accepted.

|`RESOURCE_NOT_EXIST`
|The requested resource (path) does not exist.

|`DUPLICATE_RESOURCE`
|The resource already exists.

|`SERVER_ERROR`
|An error occurred in {KIE_SERVER}.

|`SUCCESS`
|The request finished successfully.

|`FAIL`
|The request failed.

|`APPROVED`
|The request was approved.

|`DENIED`
|The request was denied.

|`GONE`
|The job ID for the request could not be found due to one of the following reasons:

* The request was explicitly removed.
* The request finished and has been deleted from a status cache. A request is removed from a status cache after the cache has reached its maximum capacity.
* The request never existed.
