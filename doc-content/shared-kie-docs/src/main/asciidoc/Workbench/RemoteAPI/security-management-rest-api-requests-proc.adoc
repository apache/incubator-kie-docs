= Sending requests with the Security Management REST API using a REST client or curl utility

The Security Management REST API enables you to manage the groups, roles, and users in {PRODUCT} without using the {CENTRAL} user interface. You can send Security Management REST API requests using any REST client or curl utility.

.Prerequisites
* {CENTRAL} is installed and running.
* You have `admin` user role access to {CENTRAL}.

.Procedure
. Identify the relevant xref:security-management-rest-api-endpoints-ref_kie-apis[API endpoint] to which you want to send a request, such as `[GET] /groups` to retrieve groups in {CENTRAL}.
. In a REST client or curl utility, enter the following components for a `GET` request to `/groups`. Adjust any request details according to your use case.

For REST client:

* *Authentication*: Enter the user name and password of the {CENTRAL} user with the `admin` role.
* *HTTP Headers*: Set the following header:
** `Accept`: `application/json`
* *HTTP method*: Set to `GET`.
* *URL*: Enter the Security Management REST API base URL and endpoint, such as `\http://localhost:8080/{URL_COMPONENT_CENTRAL}/rest/groups`.


For curl utility:

* `-u`: Enter the user name and password of the {CENTRAL} user with the `admin` role.
* `-H`: Set the following header:
** `Accept`: `application/json`
* `-X`: Set to `GET`.
* *URL*: Enter the Security Management REST API base URL and endpoint, such as `\http://localhost:8080/{URL_COMPONENT_CENTRAL}/rest/groups`.
