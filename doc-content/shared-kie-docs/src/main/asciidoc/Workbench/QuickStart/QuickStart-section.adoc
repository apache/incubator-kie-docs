== Define Data Model


After a Project has been created you need to define Types to be used by your rules.

Select "Data Object" from the "Add Asset" menu.

[NOTE]
====
You can also use types contained in existing JARs.

Please consult the full documentation for details.

image::Workbench/QuickStart/QuickStart-create-drl-file.png[align="center"]


Enter a file name for the new rule. 

[NOTE]
====
Make sure you select the same package as the rule had. It is possible to have rules and data models in different packages, but let's keep things simple for demo purposes. 
====

.Entering a file name for rule
image::Workbench/QuickStart/QuickStart-new-rule-popup.png[align="center"]


Enter a definition for the rule.

The definition process differs from asset type to asset type.

The full documentation has details about the different editors.

.Defining a rule
image::Workbench/QuickStart/QuickStart-writing-a-rule.png[align="center"]


Once the rule has been defined it will need to be saved in the same way we saved the model.

[[_wb.quickstartbuildanddeloy]]
== Build and Deploy


Once rules have been defined within a project; the project can be built and deployed to the Workbench's Maven Artifact Repository.

To build a project select the "Build & Deploy" from the Project Authoring.

.Building a project
image::Workbench/QuickStart/QuickStart-build-and-deploy.png[align="center"]

Click "Build & Deploy" to build the project and deploy it to the Workbench's Maven Artifact Repository.

When you select Build & Deploy the workbench will deploy to any repositories defined in the Dependency Management section of the pom in your workbench project.
You can edit the pom.xml file associated with your workbench project under the Repository View of the project explorer.
Details on dependency management in maven can be found here : http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html

If there are errors during the build process they will be reported in the "Messages" panel.

Now the project has been built and deployed; it can be referenced from your own projects as any other Maven Artifact.

The full documentation contains details about integrating projects with your own applications.
