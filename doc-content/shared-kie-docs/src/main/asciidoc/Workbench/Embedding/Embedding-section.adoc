= Embedding {CENTRAL} in Your Application

Apart from the individual perspectives (such as the Library or Content Management), {CENTRAL} provides a number of editors used for designing and managing assets in different formats. Within {CENTRAL}, each asset type has a corresponding editor.

{CENTRAL} provides the possibility to embed the perspectives and editors in the user's application using the *standalone mode*. Without actually switching to {CENTRAL}, it is possible to display perspectives and edit various assets, such as rules, processes, or decision tables, in separate applications.

To embed a part of {CENTRAL} in an application, {CENTRAL} must be deployed and running on a web server or an application server. Then, in your application, include an https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe[HTML inline frame] with the proper HTTP query parameters as described in the following table.
