= Artifact management

You can manage artifacts from the *Artifacts* page in {CENTRAL}. The artifact repository is a local Maven repository and there is only one Maven repository for each installation. {CENTRAL} recommends using Maven repository solutions like _Sonatype Nexus(TM)_, _Apache Archiva(TM)_, or _JFrog Artifactory(TM)_.

The *Artifacts* page lists all the artifacts in the Maven repository. You can upload artifacts to the Maven repository.

[NOTE]
=====
You can only upload JAR, KJAR, and `pom.xml` files to the *Artifacts* repository.
