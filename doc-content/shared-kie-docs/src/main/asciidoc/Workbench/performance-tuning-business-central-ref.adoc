= Performance tuning considerations with {CENTRAL}

The following key concepts or suggested practices can help you optimize {CENTRAL} configuration and {PRODUCT} performance. These concepts are summarized in this section as a convenience and are explained in more detail in the cross-referenced documentation, where applicable. This section will expand or change as needed with new releases of {PRODUCT}.

Ensure that development mode is enabled during development::
You can set {KIE_SERVER} or specific projects in {CENTRAL} to use `production` mode or `development` mode. By default, {KIE_SERVER} and all new projects in {CENTRAL} are in development mode. This mode provides features that facilitate your development experience, such as flexible project deployment policies, and features that optimize {KIE_SERVER} performance during development, such as disabled duplicate GAV detection. Use development mode until your {PRODUCT} environment is established and completely ready for production mode.

Disable verification and validation of complex guided decision tables::
The decision table verification and validation feature of {CENTRAL} is enabled by default. This feature helps you validate your guided decision tables, but with complex guided decision tables, this feature can hinder {DECISION_ENGINE} performance. You can disable this feature by setting the `org.kie.verification.disable-dtable-realtime-verification` system property value to `true`.

endif::[]
--

Disable automatic builds if you have many large projects::
In {CENTRAL}, when you navigate between projects in the *Project Explorer* side panel, the selected project is built automatically so that the *Alerts* window is updated to show any build errors for the project. If you have large projects or frequently switch between many projects that are under active development, this feature can hinder {CENTRAL} and {DECISION_ENGINE} performance.
+
--
To disable automatic project builds, set the `org.kie.build.disable-project-explorer` system property to `true`.
