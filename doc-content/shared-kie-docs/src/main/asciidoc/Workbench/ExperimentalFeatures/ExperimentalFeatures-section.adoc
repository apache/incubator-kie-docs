= Experimental Features Framework

This section describes the _Experimental Features Framework_ functionality and how users can use it.

== Introduction

The _Experimental Features Framework_ is a platform service that allows developers to deliver features which are still not
part of the Workbench (ongoing developments, tech previews, POCs...) and expose them to users to let them have a preview
of what will be comming in the future.

The _Experimental Features Framework_ provides the following features:

** New Editor UI to allow the users to enable and disable the _Experimental Features_ accessible on the *Admin* page
** Support for user-level features (stored as system preferences for each user) and global features (only available in
the Editor for admin users)
** Ability to dynamically handle the visibility for different _Experimental Resources_ on the Workbench.

**** Workbench Screens
**** Workbench Editors
**** Library Asset Types
**** Page Builder Layout Components

== Types of _Experimental Features_

There are two types of _Experimental Features_ with different scopes:

** *User*: This type of feature can be enabled or disabled for any platform user, making the feature available for a single
user without affecting other users, storing the feature state as a user preference.

** *Global*: This type of features are global for all users. Only users with admin permissions user can enable or disable
them.

== Experimental Features Editor

The _Experimental Features Framework_ provides an editor UI that enables users configure the features he wants to use.
To open it go to the *Admin* page and click on the *Experimental* menu option.

== Enabling the Experimental Features Framework

By default the _Experimental Features Framework_ is disabled. Is it possible to enable it by starting the Workbench
setting the system property ``appformer.experimental.features=true``.

Any _Experimental Feature_ present on the Workbench won't be accessible for users while the _Experimental Features Framework_
is disabled.
