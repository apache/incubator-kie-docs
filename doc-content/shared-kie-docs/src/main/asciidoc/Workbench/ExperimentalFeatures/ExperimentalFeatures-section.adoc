= Experimental Features Framework

This section describes the _Experimental Features Framework_ functionality and how to use it.

== Introduction

The _Experimental Features Framework_ is a platform service that allows developers to deliver features which are still not
part of {CENTRAL} (for example, ongoing developments, tech previews, POCs...) and expose these features to users to let them have a preview
of what is coming in the future.

The _Experimental Features Framework_ provides the following features:

** New Editor UI, accessible on the *Admin* page, where users can enable and disable _Experimental Features_.
** Support for user-level features (stored as system preferences for each user) and global features (only available to
``admin`` users, in the editor)
** Ability to dynamically handle the visibility for different _Experimental Resources_ on {CENTRAL}.

**** {CENTRAL} Perspectives
**** {CENTRAL} Screens
**** {CENTRAL} Editors
**** Library Asset Types
**** Page Builder Layout Components

== Types of _Experimental Features_

There are two types of _Experimental Features_, each with different scopes:

** *User*: This type of feature can be enabled or disabled for any platform user, making the feature available for a single
user without affecting other users, storing the feature state as a user preference.

** *Global*: This type of feature is global for all users. Only users with administrator permissions user can enable them.

== Experimental Features Editor

The _Experimental Features Framework_ provides an editor where users can configure the features that they want to use.
To open the editor, navigate to the *Admin* page and click the *Experimental* menu option.

The Experimental Features Editor displays all the _Experimental Features_ installed on {CENTRAL}. For a better user experience
these features are organized in collapsible groups. Click a label to expand or collapse a group.

Each row inside of the group corresponds to an experimental feature. Click toggle button to enable or disable the feature.

You can also enable or disable all group features by clicking the group's *Enable all" / "Disable all" button.

== Enabling the Experimental Features Framework

By default, the _Experimental Features Framework_ is disabled. You can enable it by starting {CENTRAL}
and setting the system property ``appformer.experimental.features=true``.

Any _Experimental Feature_ present on {CENTRAL} will not be accessible to users while the _Experimental Features Framework_
is disabled.
