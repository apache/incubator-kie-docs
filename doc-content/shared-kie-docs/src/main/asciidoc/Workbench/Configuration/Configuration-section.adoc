[[_wb.usermanagement]]
== Basic user management


{CENTRAL} authenticates its users against the application server's authentication and authorization (JAAS).

On JBoss EAP and WildFly, add a user with the script `jboss-cli.sh` (or ``$$.$$bat``):


[source,bash]
----
$ ./bin/jboss-cli.sh --commands="embed-server --std-out=echo,/subsystem=elytron/filesystem-realm=ApplicationRealm:add-identity(identity=<USERNAME>),/subsystem=elytron/filesystem-realm=ApplicationRealm:set-password(identity=<USERNAME>, clear={password='<PASSWORD>'}),/subsystem=elytron/filesystem-realm=ApplicationRealm:add-identity-attribute(identity=<USERNAME>, name=role, value=['admin'])"
----

There is no need to restart the application server.
