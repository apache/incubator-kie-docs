A workbench is structured with Spaces and Projects:

[[_wb.space]]
=== Space

Spaces are useful to model departments and divisions.

A Space can hold multiple Projects.

[[_wb.project]]
=== Project

Projects are the place where assets are stored and each project belongs to a single Space. 

Projects are in fact a Virtual File System based storage, that by default uses GIT as backend.
Such setup allows workbench to work with multiple backends and, in the same time, take full advantage of backend specifics features like in GIT case versioning, branching and even external access.

A new Project can be created from scratch or cloned from an existing repository.

One of the biggest advantage of using GIT as backend is the ability to clone a repository from external and use your preferred tools to edit and build your assets.

[WARNING]
====
*Never* clone your repositories directly from <<_wb.systemproperties,$$.$$niogit>> directory.

[[_wb.workbenchconcepts]]
== {CENTRAL} user interface concepts


The Workbench is comprised of different logical entities: 

* Part
+ 
A Part is a screen or editor with which the user can interact to perform operations.
+ 
Example Parts are "Project Explorer", "Project Editor", "Guided Rule Editor" etc.
* Page
+ 
A perspective is a logical grouping of related Panels and Parts. A perspective is usually named as _page_, since it is
a term far more familiar to end users whereas a perspective is more developer oriented. Notice however, the Workbench
supports both developer created pages and those created by end users from the page builder (aka Content Management)
tooling but, generally speaking, _page_ is used to refer both.
+ 
The user can switch between pages by clicking on one of the top-level menu items; such as "Home", "Authoring", "Deploy" etc.
