[[_wb.projectexplorer]]
= Project Explorer


The Project Explorer provides the ability to browse files inside the current Project. The Project Explorer can be accessed from the left side when an Asset Editor is open.

[[_wb.projectexplorerempty]]
== Initial view

If a file is currently being edited by another user, a lock symbol will be displayed in front of the file name.
The symbol is blue in case the lock is owned by the currently authenticated user, otherwise black.
Moving the mouse pointer over the lock symbol will display a tooltip providing the name of the user who is currently editing the file (and therefore owning the lock). To learn more about locking see <<_wb.asseteditor>>
 for details.
