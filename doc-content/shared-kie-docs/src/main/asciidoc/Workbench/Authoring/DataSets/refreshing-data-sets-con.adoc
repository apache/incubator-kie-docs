= Data refresh

The data refresh feature enables you to specify an interval of time after which a data set (or data) is refreshed. You can access the *Data refresh every* feature on the *Advanced* tab of the data set. 
The *Refresh on stale data* feature refreshes the cached data when the back-end data changes.
