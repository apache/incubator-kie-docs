= Project Editor


The Project Editor screen can be accessed from Project Explorer.
Project Editor shows the settings for the currently active project. 

Unlike most of the workbench editors, project  editor edits more than one file.
Showing everything that is needed for configuring the KIE project in one place.

== Build & Deploy


Build & Depoy builds the current project and deploys the KJAR into the workbench internal Maven repository.

== Project Settings 


Project Settings edits the pom.xml file used by Maven.

=== Project General Settings 


General settings provide tools for project name and GAV-data (Group, Artifact, Version). GAV values are used as identifiers to differentiate projects and versions of the same project.

=== Dependencies


The project may have any number of either internal or external dependencies.
Dependency is a project that has been built and deployed to a Maven repository.
Internal dependencies are projects build and deployed in the same workbench as the project.
External dependencies are retrieved from repositories outside of the current workbench.
Each dependency uses the GAV-values to specify the project name and version that is used by the project.

==== Package Name White List


Classes and declared types in white listed packages show up as Data Objects that can be imported in assets.
The full list is stored in package-name-white-list file that is stored in each project root. 

Package white list has three modes:  

* All packages included: Every package defined in this jar is white listed.


* Packages not included: None of the packages listed in this jar are white listed.


* Some packages included: Only part of the packages in the jar are white listed.


=== Metadata 


Metadata for the pom.xml file.

== Knowledge Base Settings


Knowledge Base Settings edits the kmodule.xml file used by Drools.

[NOTE]
====

For more information about the Knowledge Base properties, check the Drools Expert documentation for kmodule.xml.
====

=== Knowledge bases and sessions 


Knowledge bases and sessions lists the knowledge bases and the knowledge sessions specified for the project. 

==== Knowledge base list


Lists all the knowledge bases by name.
Only one knowledge base can be set as default. 

==== Knowledge base properties


Knowledge base can include other knowledge bases.
The models, rules and any other content in the included knowledge base will be visible and usable by the currently selected knowledge base.

Rules and models are stored in packages.
The packages property specifies what packages are included into this knowledge base.

Equals behavior is explained in the Drools Expert part of the documentation.

Event processing mode is explained in the Drools Fusion part of the documentation. 

==== Knowledge sessions


The table lists all the knowledge sessions in the selected knowledge base.
There can be only one default of each type.
The types are stateless and stateful.
Clicking the pen-icon opens a popup that shows more properties for the knowledge session.

=== Metadata 


Metadata for the kmodule.xml

== Imports 


Settings edits the project.imports file used by the workbench editors.

=== External Data Objects 


Data Objects provided by the Java Runtime environment may need to be registered to be available to rule authoring where such  Data Objects are not implicitly available as part of an existing Data Object defined within the Workbench or a Project dependency.
For example an Author may want to define a rule that checks for `java.util.ArrayList` in Working Memory.
If a domain Data  Object has a field of type `java.util.ArrayList` there is no need create a registraton.

=== Metadata


Metadata for the project.imports file.

== Duplicate GAV detection


When performing any of the following operations a check is now made against all Maven Repositories, resolved for the Project,  for whether the Project's GroupId, ArtifactId and Version pre-exist.
If a clash is found the operation is prevented; although this can be overridden by Users with the `admin` role.

[NOTE]
====
The feature can be disabled by setting the System Property `org.guvnor.project.gav.check.disabled` to ``true``.
====


Resolved repositories are those discovered in:- 

* The Project's `POM```<repositories>`` section (or any parent ``POM``).
* The Project's `POM```<distributionManagement>`` section.
* Maven's global `settings.xml` configuration file.

Affected operations:- 

* Creation of new Managed Repositories.
* Saving a Project defintion with the Project Editor.
* Adding new Modules to a Managed Multi-Module Repository.
* Saving the `pom.xml` file.
* Build & installing a Project with the Project Editor.
* Build & deploying a Project with the Project Editor.
* Asset Management operations building, installing or deloying Projects.
* `REST` operations creating, installing or deploying Projects.

Users with the `Admin` role can override the list of Repositories checked using the "Repositories" settings in the Project Editor.
