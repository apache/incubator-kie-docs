= Data source and database driver management

{CENTRAL} provides data source management features that enable you to define data sources for accessing a database. These data sources are then used by other {CENTRAL} components such as data sets. A database driver enables communication between a data source and the targeted database.

From the *Data Source Authoring* page you can add data sources and database drivers to {CENTRAL}.

[NOTE]
====
{CENTRAL} provides a default data source that can be used but cannot be edited or deleted.
