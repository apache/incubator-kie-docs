[[_wb.validation]]
= Validation


{CENTRAL} provides a common and consistent service for users to understand whether files authored within the environment are valid.

[[_wb.problemspanel]]
== Problem Panel


The Problems Panel shows real-time validation results of assets within a Project.

When a Project is selected from the Project Explorer the Problems Panel will refresh with validation results of the chosen Project.

When files are created, saved or deleted the Problems Panel content will update to show either new validation errors, or remove existing if a file was deleted.

[[_wb.ondemandvalidation]]
== On demand validation


It is not always desirable to save a file in order to determine whether it is in a valid state.

All of the file editors provide the ability to validate the content before it is saved.

Clicking on the 'Validate' button shows validation errors, if any.
