= Roundtrip and concurrency

Current version implements roundtrip and code preservation between Data modeller and Java source code.
No matter where the Java code was generated (e.g.
Eclipse, Data modeller), the data modeller will only create/delete/update the necessary code elements to maintain the model updated, i.e, fields, getter/setters, constructors, equals method and hashCode method.
Also whatever Type or Field annotation not managed by the Data Modeler will be preserved when the Java sources are updated by the Data modeller. 

Aside from code preservation, like in the other workbench editors, concurrent modification scenarios are still possible.
Common scenarios are when two different users are updating the model for the same project, e.g.
using the data modeller or executing a 'git push command' that modifies project sources. 

From an application context's perspective, we can basically identify two different main scenarios:

== No changes have been undertaken through the application


In this scenario the application user has basically just been navigating through the data model, without making any changes to it.
Meanwhile, another user modifies the data model externally.

In this case, no immediate warning is issued to the application user.
However, as soon as the user tries to make any kind of change, such as add or remove data objects or properties, or change any of the existing ones, the following pop-up will be shown:

.External changes warning

The user can choose to either:

* Re-open the data model, thus loading any external changes, and then perform the modification he was about to undertake, or
* Ignore any external changes, and go ahead with the modification to the model. In this case, when trying to persist these changes, another pop-up warning will be shown:
+

.Force save / re-open

+
The "Force Save" option will effectively overwrite any external changes, while "Re-open" will discard any local changes and reload the model.
+

[WARNING]
====
"Force Save" overwrites any external changes!
====



== Changes have been undertaken through the application


The application user has made changes to the data model.
Meanwhile, another user simultaneously modifies the data model from outside the application context.

In this alternative scenario, immediately after the external user commits his changes to the asset repository (or e.g.
saves the model with the data modeller in a different session), a warning is issued to the application user:

.External changes warning
image::Workbench/Authoring/DataModeller/extchanges_reopen_ignore.jpg[align="center"]


As with the previous scenario, the user can choose to either:

* Re-open the data model, thus losing any modifications that where made through the application, or
* Ignore any external changes, and continue working on the model.
+ 
One of the following possibilities can now occur:
** The user tries to persist the changes he made to the model by clicking the "Save" button in the data modeller top level menu. This leads to the following warning message:
+

.Force save / re-open
image::Workbench/Authoring/DataModeller/extchanges_forcesave_reopen.jpg[align="center"]

+
The "Force Save" option will effectively overwrite any external changes, while "Re-open" will discard any local changes and reload the model.
