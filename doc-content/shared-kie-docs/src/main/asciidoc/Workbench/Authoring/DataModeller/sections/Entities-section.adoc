= Data Objects


A data model consists of data objects which are a logical representation of some real-world data.
Such data objects have a fixed set of modeller (or application-owned) properties, such as its internal identifier, a label, description, package etc.
Besides those, a data object also has a variable set of user-defined fields, which are an abstraction of a real-world property of the type of data that this logical data object represents. 

Creating a data object can be achieved using the workbench "New Item - Data Object" menu option.

Both resource name and location are mandatory parameters.
When the "Ok" button is pressed a new Java file will be created and a new editor instance will be opened for the file edition.
The optional "Persistable" attribute will add by default configurations on the data object in order to make it a JPA entity.
Use this option if your jBPM project needs to store data object's information in a data base.
