[[_wb.releasenotesworkbench.7.13.0.final]]
= New and Noteworthy in KIE Workbench 7.13.0

== Test Scenarios (Preview) editor

This version contains the preview of the new Test Scenarios editor that tests a rule with a completely new user experience.

See section <<_drools.testscenarioprevieweditor>> for details on enabling and using the editor.

== Experimental Features support

New _Experimental Features Framework_ added to the Workbench. It provides an easy mechanism for users to preview features
which are not part of the product but might be interesting for them (for example, ongoing developments, tech previews, POCs...).

See section <<_wb.experimentalFeatures>> for more details.

== SSH keystore

In order to provide the Workbench VFS with proper SSH authentication, a new keystore must added. This keystore
enables users to register their SSH public keys.

You can access it from the *Admin* page using the new *SSH Keys* menu option.
