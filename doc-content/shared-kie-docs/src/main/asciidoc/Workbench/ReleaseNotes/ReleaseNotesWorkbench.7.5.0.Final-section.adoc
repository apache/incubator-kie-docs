= New and Noteworthy in KIE Workbench 7.5.0

== Content management enhancements

Remarkable changes have been introduced in the _Content Management_ (aka _Dashboards_) tooling in order to
improve the user experience.

=== Perspective to page renaming

The "page" term is far more familiar to users. Notice that, "perspective" is a concept that was borrowed from the Eclipse
development tool, thus it is a concept mostly used in developer circles. Page is more related to web content, easier to
understand by regular people. For this reason, perspective has been renamed to page all over the tooling.

=== Left sidebar new look and feel

This is the most noticeable change introduced. The left sidebar has been completely rewritten in order to provide an
enhanced look and feel.

The two sections _Pages_ and _Navigation_ have been merged into a single view. From this view users can either create
new pages or change the navigation configuration.

The _Navigation_ section lists the navigation trees. Specifically, the tree named _Workbench_ is available by
default, it can not be deleted and it contains the entries displayed in the workbench's top mega menu. Any change applied
to it will cause the mega menu to modify its entries. This is actually the mechanism users must use to extend the workbench
with new pages.

=== Tags button disabled

The tags feature or the ability to attach a set of labels to a page during edition time has been removed. This
feature in combination with the former "Apps" perspective was used to allow users to publish their dynamic pages
in a categorized way. This feature is no longer needed. During the edition of a page, the _Tags_ button, that used
to appear at the editor's top right button bar, has been removed.

As a replacement, users can leverage the existing navigation features to create new pages and attach them
to the workbench's mega menu.

== Extra navigation components

The existing navigation components available in the _Content Management_ tooling have been extended with some extra types.
To date there exist the following components:

* Tile navigator
* Tab list
* Carousel

The following have recently been added to the release:

=== Menu bar

As its name states, this component displays the entries of a navigation tree in a manu bar shape. There is no limit to
the number of levels supported. When a page item is clicked, the page content is displayed in the _Target div_
(see details below) component specified in the menu bar's configuration.

=== Tree navigator

Same as the _Menu bar_, but the entries are displayed as a vertical tree structure.

=== Target div

Both the _Carousel_ and the _Tile navigator_ components can handle by themselves the display of the items the user clicks on.
Others like _Tab list_, _Menu bar_ and _Tree navigator_ require a _Target div_ component as its display output since they
have a clear separation between the display of its entries and the content of the last item clicked.

So, every time, a _Target div_ based navigation component is dropped into a page, a _Target div_ component must
have been dropped as well, so that the first one can link to it. The following screen shows the configuration panel that
 is displayed every time a target div based component is dropped into a page.

The navigation group is mandatory for all the navigation components as it indicates the navigation structure to display
whereas the _Target div_ setting is *not* available for non target div components like _Carousel_ or _Tile navigator_.
