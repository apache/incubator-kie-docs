== Test Scenario (Preview) renamed to Test Scenario and List/Map support

Old Test Scenario has been renamed as Test Scenario (Legacy) and Test Scenario (Preview) now is Test Scenario.
The editor now supports also List and Map as supported data types for testing.

== Development streamline lifecycle

Along with the new development mode on KIE Server, {CENTRAL} also adds a simplified deployment mechanism for
_SNAPSHOT_ modules to improve the user experience during the development and testing phases of a module.
Some of the changes introduced:

* More flexible deployment policy, allowing you to run module updates with no need of undeploying previous deployments.

* Once a _SNAPSHOT_ module is deployed, {CENTRAL} will store the user deployment preferences making subsequent
deployments update the previously deployed container. This mechanism also keeps the active process instances.

* Added ability to redeploy a module, updating the container with latest changes but aborting the active process instances.

Other changes introduced:

.New *Development Mode* toggle on the module *General Settings* screen to turn the module into _SNAPSHOT_
