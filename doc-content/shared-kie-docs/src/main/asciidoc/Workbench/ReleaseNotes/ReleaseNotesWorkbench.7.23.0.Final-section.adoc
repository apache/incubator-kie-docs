= New and Noteworthy in Business Central 7.23.0

== Enhanced BC collaboration features

The following enhancements were added to Business Central to provide additional options for managing access to spaces and projects.

.Security Management user interface

With the introduction of this new feature, it is now possible to manage spaces and projects permissions directly in their respective screens, using the Contributors tab. When contributors are added to a space, they are able to open it and see its projects and other information available. Based on their contributor role, they also have the following permissions granted:

* _Owner_: Update contributors, delete spaces, create and delete projects

* _Admin_: Update contributors (except owners) and create projects

* _Contributor_: Create projects

.Space Contributors tab

When a project is created inside a space, its contributors are copied from the space and the project creator becomes the owner of the new project. It is also possible to add new contributors to the project if they are also contributors to the project's space. Contributors can view the project, and depending on their role, they may also have the following permissions:

* _Owner_: View, update, build, deploy, and delete projects

* _Admin_: View, update, build and deploy projects

* _Contributor_: View, update and build projects

.Project Contributors tab

The security check uses both the Security Management user interface and Contributors tab to assign permissions to spaces and projects. For example, users can delete a space if they are assigned to a role with the required permissions or is an owner of that space.


== Role based access control for branches

In addition to the new collaboration features, you can customize contributor role permissions for each branch of a project.

.Branch Management settings section

Select which permissions each contributor role has for the selected branch.


== Importing a subset of branches

When importing projects from a repository, you can select only the branches that you want to persist in Business Central.

. In Business Central, click *Menu* → *Design* → *Projects*.
. Select or create the space into which you want to import the project. The default space is MySpace.
. Click the three dots on the right side of the screen and select *Import Project*.

== DMN included models

The DMN designer contains a new *Included Models* tab that you can use to include externally defined DMN models in the specified DMN file. When you add an included model in a DMN file, you can reuse components of the included model in that DMN file. This enhancement helps you more efficiently integrate DMN logic between different DMN models in your project.
