= Support for default home pages in Dashbuilder Runtime

Dashboards imported in Dashbuilder Runtime can have a default page:

* When the imported dashboard has only one page, then it is used as the default page;
* If a page is named `index` then it will be used as the default page;
* In other cases the generic Dashbuilder Runtime home page is used.
