= Support for multiple diagrams in DMN models

For complex DMN models, you can now use the DMN designer in {CENTRAL} to design multiple DMN decision requirements diagrams (DRDs) that represent parts of the overall decision requirements graph (DRG) for a DMN decision model. This improvement enables you to better organize DMN decision models with many decision requirements by dividing the model into smaller nested DRDs.
