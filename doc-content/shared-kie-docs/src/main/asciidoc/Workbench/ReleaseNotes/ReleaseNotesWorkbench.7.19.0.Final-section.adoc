= What is New and Noteworthy in KIE Workbench 7.19.0

== DMN Automatic Layout
Nodes in DMN decision requirements diagrams (DRDs) can be positioned automatically with the new *Perform automatic layout* toolbar button. This automatic layout feature orients DRD nodes vertically, from the bottom to the top of the  DRD. However, automatic layout currently does not support *Decision Service* nodes.

== DMN and Test Scenario context menu keyboard control
In both DMN and Test Scenario tables, keyboard support for the context menu invocation was added. You can now invoke a context menu by typing *Ctrl+Space*.
