[[_wb.releasenotesworkbench.7.15.0.final]]
= New and Noteworthy in KIE Workbench 7.15.0

== Git hooks notifications
Improved git hooks integration to provide feedback notifications to the user with customized messages.

== KIE Workbench Consolidation
KIE Workbench is now called Business Central and it is available on `business-central` web context. To select which Business Central features will be available we have the concept of a Profiles, which is a set of features available for users. By default the FULL profile is used and it has all features and there's also the PLANNER_AND_RULES profile, which has only drools-kie-wb features. To select a profile one can use the `org.kie.workbench.profile` system property (possible values are `FULL` or `PLANNER_AND_RULES`) or use the Profile option in Administration screen.
