= New and Noteworthy in KIE Workbench 7.15.0

== Git hooks notifications
Improved git hooks integration to provide feedback notifications to the user with customized messages.

== KIE Workbench Consolidation
KIE Workbench is now called Business Central and it is available on `business-central` web context.
Profiles provide a set of Business Central features and you can choose a profile based on your requirements.
The `FULL` profile is a default profile that includes all features. The `PLANNER_AND_RULES` profile includes only drools-kie-wb features. You can select a profile either by using the `org.kie.workbench.profile` system property (possible values are FULL or PLANNER_AND_RULES) or from the Profile option in the Administration screen.
