[[_wb.releasenotesworkbench.6.1.0]]
= New and Noteworthy in KIE Workbench 6.1.0

== Data Modeler - round trip and source code preservation


Full round trip between Data modeler and Java source code is now supported.
No matter where the Java code was generated (e.g.
Eclipse, Data modeller), data modeler will only update the necessary code blocks to maintain the model updated.

== Data Modeler - improved annotations


New annotations @TypeSafe, @ClassReactive, @PropertyReactive, @Timestamp, @Duration and @Expires were added in order to enrich current Drools annotations managed by the data modeler.

== Standardization of the display of tabular data


We have standardized the display of tabular data with a new table widget.

The new table supports the following features: 

* Selection of visible columns
* Resizable columns
* Moveable columns

The table is used in the following scenarios: 

* Inbox (Incoming changes)
* Inbox (Recently edited)
* Inbox (Recently opened)
* Project Problems summary
* Artifact Repository browser
* Project Editor Dependency grid
* Project Editor KSession grid
* Project Editor Work Item Handlers Configuration grid
* Project Editor Listeners Configuration grid
* Search Results grid


== Generation of `modify(x) {...}` blocks


The Guided Rule Editor, Guided Template Editor and Guided Decision Table Editor have been changed to generate `modify(x){...}`

Historically these editors supported the older `update(x)` syntax and hence rules created within the Workbench would not respond correctly to `@PropertyReactive` and associated annotations within a model.
This has now been rectified with the use of `modify(x){...}` blocks.
