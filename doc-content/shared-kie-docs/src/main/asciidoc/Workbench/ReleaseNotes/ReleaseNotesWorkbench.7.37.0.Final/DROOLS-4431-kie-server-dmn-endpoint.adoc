= Enhanced DMN KIE Server endpoint

Previously, a Drools project containing DMN assets and explicitly defining a default session, required to specify the default `KieSession` as stateful session; if other non-DMN assets required a stateless session, that also required to modify all other requests to use a stateless `KieSession`, explicitly. In this release, the limitation is resolved, and all DMN models and runtimes execute with default `KieBase`, including the instance when `KieBase` is manually specified by default (ref: DROOLS-4431).
