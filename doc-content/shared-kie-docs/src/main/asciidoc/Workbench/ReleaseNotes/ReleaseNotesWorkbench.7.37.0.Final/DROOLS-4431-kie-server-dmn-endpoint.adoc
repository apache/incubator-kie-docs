= Enhancement to DMN kie-server endpoint (DROOLS-4431)

Previously, a Business Central project containing DMN assets required that if any `KieSession` was manually specified as default, that had to be a stateful one.
In case the Business Central project needed to specify a stateless `KieSession`, the only available workaround was to specify a *default* `KieSession` that is stateful, and modify all other requests to use the stateless `KieSession`.

This limitation has been resolved with `DROOLS-4431`.

Moreover, now all `DMN Model`(s) and the `DMNRuntime` are resolved directly over the default `KieBase`, including the case where any is manually specified as a default `KieBase`.
