== Project Metrics Dashboard

A brand new dashboard is now available for every project listed in the authoring library. After opening the project details page, a metrics card shows up on the right side of the screen.

The card shows the history of contributions (commits) made to that specific project over time.
Click the _View All_ link to access the full dashboard that shows several metrics all about the project's contributions.
