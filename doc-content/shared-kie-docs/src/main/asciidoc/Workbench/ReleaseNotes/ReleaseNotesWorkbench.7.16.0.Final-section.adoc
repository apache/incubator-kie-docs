= What is New and Noteworthy in KIE Workbench 7.16.0

== DMN and Test Scenario keyboard control

For both DMN and Test Scenario assets the following keyboard control support was added:

* *Navigation:* once a cell is selected, the arrow keys can be used to navigate between other cells. Selecting the first cell differs for both editors:
** For the DMN the top left cell is selected by default. Next to standard navigation, *Enter* can be used to select a nested expression and *Esc* can be used to return back to parent expression.
** For the Test Scenario no cell is selected by default. First available cell is selected by *Shift + Home*.
* *Editing:* once a cell is selected, it is possible to input a new value into the cell or change the already added value. To edit a cell, press *Enter*. To stop the editing, press *Shift + Tab*.
