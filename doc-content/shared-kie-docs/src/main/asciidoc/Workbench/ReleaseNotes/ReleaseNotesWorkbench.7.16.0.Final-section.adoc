== DMN and Test Scenario keyboard control

For both DMN and Test Scenario tables, the following keyboard control support was added:

* *Table navigation:* After you select a cell in a DMN or Test Scenario table, you can use the arrow keys to navigate between other cells. The way you select the first cell differs in DMN and Test Scenario tables:
** In a DMN table, the top-left cell is selected by default. Next to standard navigation, press *Enter* to select a nested expression and *Esc* to return to the parent expression.
** In a Test Scenario table, no cell is selected by default. Press *Shift+Home* to select the first available cell.
* *Table editing:* After you select a cell in a DMN or Test Scenario table, you can input a new value into the cell or change the already added value. To edit a cell, press *Enter*. To stop the editing, press *Shift+Tab*.
