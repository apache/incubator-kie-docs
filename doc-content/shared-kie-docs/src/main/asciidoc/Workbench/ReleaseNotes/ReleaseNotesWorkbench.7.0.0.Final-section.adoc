[[_wb.releasenotesworkbench.7.0.0.final]]
= New and Noteworthy in KIE Workbench 7.0.0

The workbench has been updated to support Wildfly 10 and EAP7.  Minimum Java requirement is JDK8.

== New Authoring (Library)

Authoring now has a new design, with a better information organization. It's now possible to manage (create, delete and edit) Teams (Organizational Units), list Projects in a Repository and the Assets in a Project. When an Asset is selected, you can see the Asset Editor and the Project Explorer.


[NOTE]
====
The Library uses the indexing of the Workbench. It is, therefore, *imperative* that existing index information is deleted so that the Workbench can rebuild them with the necessary information. Index information is stored in the ``.index`` folder within your application servers ``\bin`` folder (or as you may have configured otherwise with the ``org.uberfire.metadata.index.dir`` System Property).

Also, you can set some preferences about your default workspace by accessing Home > Admin > Library.

== Authoring - Imports of Examples

Prior to 7.x the Workbench used to install pre-defined examples at startup.

Version 7.x brings the ability to import examples from git repositories.
The Authoring Perspective contains a menu item for 'Examples' clicking this launches a Wizard to guide you through the import.

== Authoring - Pop-ups improvements

All system pop-ups had their UX improved.

The "comment" field is hidden by default.

Now, the destination package can be selected when a project file is copied from any package.

== Authoring - Project Editor - Reimport button

The "Reimport" button invalidates all cached dependencies, in order to handle scenarios where a specific dependency was updated without having its version modified.

== Security Management

The User and Group management perspectives released in version 6.4 have been unified into a single perspective which delivers a shared view for managing both users and groups as well as the permissions granted to any of the application roles.

This very new perspective is placed under the _Home_ section in the top menu bar.

The next screenshot shows how this new perspective looks:

.Security Management Home

A tabbed pane is shown on the left, allowing the User to select the _Roles_, _Groups_ or _Users_ tab. After clicking on a Role (or Group)
a detailed screen is displayed allowing the user to configure some security settings.

* *Home Perspective*: The target perspective where the user is directed after login, which makes it possible to have different home pages per role/group.

* *Priority*: Used to determine what settings (home perspective, permissions, ...) have precedence for those users with more than one role or group assigned.

* *Permissions*: A full ACL (_Access Control List_) editor for grant/deny permissions over the different resources available in the platform like _Perspectives_,
_Organizational Units_, _Repositories_ or _Projects_. Global permissions on top of any of those resource types can be ovewritten by means of adding individual exceptions
which makes it possible to implement both the _grant all deny a few_ or the _deny all grant a few_ strategies.

== kie-config-cli has been removed

The command-line tool `kie-config-cli.[sh/bat]` for managing remote repositories that was present in 6.x has been removed for the following reasons:

* The security-related operations it provided (`add-role-repo`, `remove-role-repo`, `add-role-org-unit`, `remove-role-org-unit`, `add-role-project`, `remove-role-project`) have been replaced by more comprehensive <<_wb.userandgroupmgmt,Security management>> feature.

* The operations related to managing deployments (`list-deployment`, `add-deployment`, `remove-deployment`) no longer make sense, since jBPM Runtime has been removed from workbench. Deployments can still be managed programmatically using <<kie-server-rest-api-con_kie-apis,Kie Server REST API>>.

* The remaining operations (`create-org-unit`, `remove-org-unit`, `list-org-units`, `create-repo`, `remove-repo`, `list-repo`, `add-repo-org-unit`, `remove-repo-org-unit`, `list-project-details`) are available as a part of <<knowledge-store-rest-api-con_kie-apis,Knowledge Store REST API>>.

== User and Project Admin Pages and Preferences

The workbench now has a new menu item: "Admin". In there, you can find some admin tools, like "Users", "Groups" and "Roles" management, and also general preferences. When a preference is changed there, it will affect all places that depend on it, but only for the logged user.

Each project also has its own admin page, with admin tools and preferences. When a preference is changed there, it will affect only that project, and only for the logged user.

== GAV conflict check and child GAV edition

It is now possible, for each user, to set the GAV conflict check flag, and also allow or block child GAV edition for all their projects, or specifically for each project.

The configuration can be found inside the admin tool "Project", in case the access is made through the "Admin" menu item. It can also be found by entering the admin tool "General", on the Project admin page.

== Data Source Management

The new data source management system empowers the workbench with the ability of defining data sources and drivers for accessing external databases.

Some of the included functionalities are:

* A new perspective for managing the data sources:

.Data Source Authoring Perspective

* A new wizard for guiding the data source creation.
