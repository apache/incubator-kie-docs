= Support for DMN 1.1 and DMN 1.3 assets in DMN designer

You can now open DMN 1.1 or DMN 1.3 assets in the DMN designer in {CENTRAL}. {PRODUCT} provides design and runtime support for DMN 1.2 models at conformance level 3, and runtime-only support for DMN 1.1 and 1.3 models at conformance level 3. You can design your DMN models directly in {CENTRAL} or with the {PRODUCT} DMN modeler in VSCode, or import existing DMN models into your {PRODUCT} projects for deployment and execution. Any DMN 1.1 and 1.3 models (do not contain DMN 1.3 features) that you import into {CENTRAL}, open in the DMN designer, and save are converted to DMN 1.2 models.
