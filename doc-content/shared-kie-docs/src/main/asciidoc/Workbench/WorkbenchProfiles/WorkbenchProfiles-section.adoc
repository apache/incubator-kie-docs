= Workbench Profiles

Starting on 7.15.0.Final, KIE Workbench was renamed to Business Central. Business Central contains all KIE Workbench features and to select what will available for users we introduced the concept of profiles. In this chapter we 
will explore Profiles and show how one can change the profile used by Business Central.

== Introduction

When Business Central (BC) is started and accessed on context `business-central` initially all the features will be available. To select which features will be available one can select the Profile that BC will use. 

A profile is a set of features which contains:

* Menus
* Resources that it can handle
* Specific home page

Currently, we have two profiles:
* **Full**: All workbench features will be enabled (default);
* **Planner and Rules**: Only Optaplanner and Drools features will be available.

== Selecting a Profile

Profiles can be selected on Administration page, by selecting the Profile preference. 

[NOTE]
====
Only admin users have access to the Profile Preference.

It is also possible to select a profile using the system property `org.kie.workbench.profile`, which can have the values `FULL` (for *Full* profile) and `PLANNER_AND_RULES` (For *Planner and Rules* profile).
