[[_wb.workbenchProfiles]]
= {CENTRAL} profiles

Starting on 7.15.0.Final, KIE Workbench is renamed to {CENTRAL}. {CENTRAL} contains all KIE Workbench features. To select between the set of available features, the concept of profiles is introduced. This chapter describes profiles and show how you can configure them in {CENTRAL}.

== Introduction

When you start the {CENTRAL} application, all the features are available to you by default. To configure a set of features, you can select from a list of profile.

A profile is a set of features which contains:

* Menus
* Resources that it can handle
* Specific home page

Currently, we have two profiles:
* **Full**: All workbench features will be enabled (default);
* **Planner and Rules**: Only Optaplanner and Drools features will be available.

== Selecting a profile

Profiles can be selected on Administration page, by selecting the Profiles preference.

[NOTE]
====
Only admin users have access to the Profiles preference.

It is also possible to select a profile using the system property `org.kie.workbench.profile`, which can have the values `FULL` (for *Full* profile) and `PLANNER_AND_RULES` (For *Planner and Rules* profile).
