= Creating and executing DMN and BPMN models using Maven

You can use Maven archetypes to develop DMN and BPMN models in VS Code using the {PRODUCT} VS Code extension instead of {CENTRAL}. You can then integrate your archetypes with your {PRODUCT} decision and process services in {CENTRAL} as needed. This method of developing DMN and BPMN models is helpful for building new business applications using the {PRODUCT} VS Code extension.

.Procedure
. In a command terminal, navigate to a local folder where you want to store the new {PRODUCT} project.
. Enter the following command to use a Maven archtype to generate a project within a defined folder:
+
.Generating a project using Maven archetype
[source,subs="attributes+"]
----
mvn archetype:generate \
    -DarchetypeGroupId=org.kie \
    -DarchetypeArtifactId=kie-kjar-archetype \
    -DarchetypeVersion={MAVEN_ARTIFACT_VERSION}
----
+
This command generates a Maven project with required dependencies and generates required directories and files to build your business application. You can use the Git version control system (recommended) when developing a project.
+
If you want to generate multiple projects in the same directory, specify the `artifactId` and `groupId` of the generated business application by adding `-DgroupId=<groupid> -DartifactId=<artifactId>` to the previous command.

. In your VS Code IDE, click *File*, select *Open Folder*, and navigate to the folder that is generated using the previous command.
+
. Before creating the first asset, set a package for your business application, for example, `org.kie.businessapp`, and create respective directories in the following paths:
+
* `PROJECT_HOME/src/main/java`
* `PROJECT_HOME/src/main/resources`
* `PROJECT_HOME/src/test/resources`

+
For example, you can create `PROJECT_HOME/src/main/java/org/kie/businessapp` for `org.kie.businessapp` package.

. Use VS Code to create assets for your business application. You can create the assets supported by {PRODUCT} VS Code extension using the following ways:
+
* To create a business process, create a new file with `.bpmn` or `.bpmn2` in `PROJECT_HOME/src/main/resources/org/kie/businessapp` directory, such as `Process.bpmn`.
* To create a DMN model, create a new file with `.dmn` in `PROJECT_HOME/src/main/resources/org/kie/businessapp` directory, such as `AgeDecision.dmn`.
* To create a test scenario simulation model, create a new file with `.scesim` in `PROJECT_HOME/src/test/resources/org/kie/businessapp` directory, such as `TestAgeScenario.scesim`.

. After you create the assets in your Maven archetype, navigate to the root directory (contains `pom.xml`) of the project in the command line and run the following command to build the knowledge JAR (KJAR) of your project:
+
[source]
----
mvn clean install
----
+
If the build fails, address any problems described in the command line error messages and try again to validate the project until the build is successful. However, if the build is successful, you can find the artifact of your business application in `PROJECT_HOME/target` directory.
+
NOTE: Use `mvn clean install` command often to validate your project after each major change during development.

You can deploy the generated knowledge JAR (KJAR) of your business application on a running {KIE_SERVER} using the REST API. For more information about using REST API, see {URL_DEPLOYING_AND_MANAGING_SERVICES}#assembly-kie-apis[_{KIE_APIS}_].
