= Developing process services with {PRODUCT}
:context: kogito-developing-process-services

// Purpose statement for the assembly
As a developer of business processes, you can use {PRODUCT} business automation to develop process services using Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) 2.0 models. BPMN process models are graphical representations of the steps required to achieve a business goal. You can design your BPMN processes with the {PRODUCT} BPMN modeler in VSCode or import existing BPMN processes into your {PRODUCT} projects for deployment and execution.

For more information about BPMN, see the Object Management Group (OMG) https://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0/About-BPMN[Business Process Model and Notation 2.0 specification].
