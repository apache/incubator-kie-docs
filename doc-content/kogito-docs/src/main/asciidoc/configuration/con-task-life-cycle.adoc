= Task lifecycle in {PRODUCT} processes

In {PRODUCT} business processes, tasks are implemented as work items and their execution is defined by work item handlers. User tasks in particular are a core construct in {PRODUCT} processes. When a user task is reached in a process, the task progresses through phases of a defined lifecycle until it reaches an end state.

{PRODUCT} supports the following default phases in a work item (task) lifecycle:

* *Active*: Indicates initial state when the work item is activated
* *Abort*: Indicates abnormal completion of the work item
* *Complete*: Indicates normal completion of the work item
* *Claim*: Assigns the work item to a specific actor, restricting access to anyone else
* *Release*: Unassigns the work item from a specific actor, releasing it to any other potential user or group to work on it (by claiming or completing)
* *Skip*: Skips the work item

With {PRODUCT}, you can also add custom lifecycles and lifecycle phases to meet your business needs.

A lifecycle moves a work item across various phases that are not defined by the `WorkItem` interface and defines the behavior of a work item at runtime. You typically add a lifecycle on top of the `WorkItemHandler` interface so that the lifecycle is pluggable with more flexible runtime characteristics.

The `WorkItemHandler` interface provides the option to move between task phases, as shown in the following method example:

.WorkItemHandler support for moving between task phases
[source, java]
----
public void transitionToPhase(WorkItem workItem, WorkItemManager manager, Transition<?> transition)
----

NOTE: This method is a default method that does nothing when not implemented. This functionality maintains backward compatibility with existing work item handler implementations.

You typically implement the `transitionToPhase` method as shown in the following example:

.Example implementation of transitionToPhase method
[source, java]
----
@Override
public void transitionToPhase(WorkItem workItem, WorkItemManager manager, Transition<?> transition) {

    lifeCycle.transitionTo(workItem, manager, (Transition<Map<String, Object>>) transition);
}
----

The `lifeCycle` element is an implementation of `org.kie.{PRODUCT_INIT}.process.workitem.LifeCycle<T>` that defines the execution semantics.

== User task authorization

The `org.jbpm.process.instance.impl.humantask.BaseHumanTaskLifeCycle` implementation in {PRODUCT} ensures that a user task is worked on by authorized users, based on the user or group assignments that you provide.

You can use the following parameters to provide assignments for authorized users or groups in the relevant BPMN process model. All of the listed parameters support expressions.

.Parameters for authorized users or groups
[cols="35%,35%,30%"]
|===
|Parameter name |Description |Example value

|`ActorId`
|Comma-separated list of authorized users
|`John,Mary,#{actor}`

|`GroupId`
|Comma-separated list of authorized groups of users
|`mangers,#{mygroup}`

|`BusinessAdministratorId`
|Comma-separated list of authorized administrators
|`administrator,#{adminuser}`

|`BusinessAdministratorGroupId`
|Comma-separated list of groups of administrators
|`admins,#{admingroup}`

|`ExcludedOwnerId`
|Comma-separated list of unauthorized users who cannot work on this task
|`paul,#{lastactor}`
|===

NOTE: Authorization is only enforced when the method that calls the work item lifecycle methods uses a security context. This security behavior is dependent on the API that you use.

== API interaction with task lifecycle phases

The following example API interacts with user tasks (work items) using lifecycle phases:

.Example API to interact with task lifecycle phases
[source, java]
----
// Start process instance
ProcessInstance<?> processInstance = approvalsProcess.createInstance(m);
processInstance.start();

// Set up security policy with identity information
StaticIdentityProvider identity = new StaticIdentityProvider("admin", Collections.singletonList("managers"));
SecurityPolicy policy = SecurityPolicy.of(identity);

// Get list of work items, taking security restrictions into account
List<WorkItem> workItems = processInstance.workItems(policy);

// Work on a task
final String wiId = workItems.get(0).getId();
processInstance.transitionWorkItem(wiId,
                                   new HumanTaskTransition(Claim.ID, null, policy));

processInstance.transitionWorkItem(wiId,
                                   new HumanTaskTransition(Complete.ID, Collections.singletonMap("approved", false), policy));
----

When you interact with user tasks through a REST API, you can also provide the following query parameters for user and group information:

.Query parameters for user or group information in REST APIs
[cols="20%,60%,20%"]
|===
|Parameter name |Description |Multi-value support

|`user`
|User name to be used for the user task authorization check
|No

|`group`
|Zero or more group names to be used for the user task authorization check
|Yes
|===

For example, the following REST endpoints interact with user tasks in an `orderItems.bpmn2` process for verifying customer orders:
