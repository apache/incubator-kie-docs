= {PRODUCT} Trusty Service and Explainability Service

{PRODUCT} provides a Trusty Service that stores all {PRODUCT} tracing events related to decisions made in {PRODUCT} services. As an aid to the Trusty Service workflow for storing tracing events, {PRODUCT} also provides a supplemental Explainability Service that provides an explaination for the decisions made in {PRODUCT} services. The Trusty Service uses Apache Kafka messaging to consume https://cloudevents.io/[CloudEvents] messages from {PRODUCT} services, and then processes the tracing events and stores the data, including any explainability results from the Explainability Service, in the Infinispan persistence store. The Explainability Service likewise uses Apache Kafka messaging to consume CloudEvents messages from the Trusty Service, and then applies explainability algorithms. Some algorithms require the Explainability Service to interact with the {PRODUCT} service that evaluated the decision. This communication is performed with HTTP `POST` requests.

The Trusty Service and Explainability Service are at the core of the TrustyAI metrics monitoring initiative in {PRODUCT}.

image::kogito/configuration/trusty-architecture_enterprise.png[Diagram of an example Kogito service using Trusty Service]

The {PRODUCT} Trusty Service has the following key attributes:

* Focus on decisions
* Flexible data structure
* Distributable and cloud-ready format
* Infinispan-based persistence support
* Message-based communication with {PRODUCT} runtime (Apache Kafka, cloud events )
* Integration with the Explainability Service to retrieve advanced analysis for the decisions

The {PRODUCT} Trusty Service and Explainability Service are Quarkus applications, based on https://vertx.io/[Vert.x] with https://smallrye.io/smallrye-reactive-messaging/[Reactive Messaging]. Tracing data from the Trusty Service is parsed and pushed into the *Decisions* cache for each decision made in a {PRODUCT} service. Each record contains information about all decision inputs, outputs, and errors, if any. 

The Trusty Service storage is provided by https://infinispan.org/[Infinispan]. Communication between the Trusty Service and Infinispan is handled through a protobuf (https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/[protocol buffers]) schema and generated marshallers.

After the tracing event is analyzed and stored, the Trusty Service exposes the data with a dedicated API.
