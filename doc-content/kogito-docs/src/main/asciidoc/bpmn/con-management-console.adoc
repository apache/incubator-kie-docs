The {PRODUCT} Management Console is a user interface for viewing the state of all available {PRODUCT} services and managing process instances:

You can use the Management Console to view process, subprocess, and node instance details, abort process instances, and view domain-specific process data.

The Management Console requires your {PRODUCT} services to use the following {PRODUCT} components:

* *{PRODUCT} Data Index Service*: Enables the Management Console to access stored events related to processes and domain data from your {PRODUCT} services. The {PRODUCT} Data Index Service requires Infinispan persistence and Apache Kafka messaging for your {PRODUCT} service. For more information about the Data Index Service, see

{URL_CONFIGURING_KOGITO}#con-data-index-service_kogito-configuring[_{CONFIGURING_KOGITO}_].
endif::[]
ifdef::KOGITO-COMM[]

endif::[]
* *{PRODUCT} process management add-on*: Enables the Management Console to interact with the process data from your {PRODUCT} services through the add-on REST endpoint `/management/processes`. If you do not enable this add-on for your {PRODUCT} service, the Management Console provides read-only access to your service data without the ability to modify instances, such as aborting process instances. For more information about the process management add-on, see xref:con-bpmn-process-management-addon_kogito-developing-process-services[].
