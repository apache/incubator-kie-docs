= Tasks supported in {PRODUCT}

BPMN tasks identify actions to be completed in a business process model and are the smallest unit of work in a process flow.

{PRODUCT} currently supports the following tasks:

//@comment: Currently unavailable in VSCode. (Stetson, 26 Mar 2020)
In addition, the BPMN2 specification provides the ability to create custom tasks. The following predefined custom tasks are included with {PRODUCT}:

* Rest service tasks: Used to invoke a remote RESTful service
* Email service tasks: Used to send an email
* Log service tasks: Used to log a message
* Java service tasks: Used to call Java code
* WebService service tasks: Used to invoke a remote WebService call
* DecisionTask tasks: Used to execute a DMN diagram

Business rule task::
+
--
A business rule task specifies a business decision to be executed either through a Decision Model and Notation (DMN) model or a Drools Rule Language (DRL) rule unit.

When a process reaches a business rule task defined by a DMN model, the {PROCESS_ENGINE} executes the DMN model decision with the inputs provided.

When a process reaches a business rule task defined by a DRL rule unit, the {PROCESS_ENGINE} begins executing the rules in the designated rule unit group. When there are no more active rules in the rule unit, the execution continues to the next element. During the rule unit execution, new activations in the rule unit are added to the {DECISION_ENGINE} agenda because these activations are changed by other rules.

In the {PRODUCT} BPMN designer, you can modify the following properties for a selected business rule task:

.Business rule task properties
[cols="30%,70%", options="header"]
|===
|Label
|Description

| *Name*
| Enter the name of the task.

| *Documentation*
| Enter a description of the task. The text in this field is included in the process documentation, if applicable.

| *Rule Language*
| Select *DMN* to invoke a defined DMN model or *DRL* to invoke a defined DRL rule unit.

| *Rule Flow Group* (for DRL)
| Specify the new rule unit in the format `unit:__PACKAGE_NAME__.__UNIT_NAME__`, such as `unit:org.acme.PersonRules`. This rule unit syntax specifies that you are using a rule unit instead of a traditional rule flow group.

| *Namespace*, *Decision Name*, *DMN Model Name* (for DMN)
| Enter the identifying information for the relevant DMN model as found in the DMN model file.

| *On Entry Action*
| Enter a Java, JavaScript, or MVEL script that specifies an action at the start of the task.

| *On Exit Action*
| Enter a Java, JavaScript, or MVEL script that specifies an action at the end of the task.

| *Is Async*
|  Select this option if this task should be invoked asynchronously. Make tasks asynchronous if they cannot be executed instantaneously, for example, a task performed by an outside service.

| *Adhoc Autostart*
| Select this option if this is an ad hoc task that should be started automatically. This option enables the task to automatically start when the process or case instance is created instead of being started by a start task.

| *SLA Due Date*
| Enter the date when the service level agreement (SLA) expires.

| *Assignments*
| Click to open the *Data I/O* window and add data input and output as required.

Script task::
+
--
A script task represents a script to be executed during the process execution. The associated script can access process variables and global variables. When a script task is reached during execution, the script is executed and the outgoing flow is taken.

Review the following list of suggestions before using a script task:

* Avoid low-level implementation details in the process. Although you can use a script task to manipulate variables, consider using a service task when modeling more complex operations.
* Ensure that the script is executed immediately. If the script is not intended to be executed immediately, consider using an asynchronous service task.
* Avoid contacting external services through a script task. Use a service task to model communication with an external service.
* Ensure scripts do not generate exceptions. Runtime exceptions should be caught and managed inside the script or transformed into signals or errors that can then be handled inside the process.

In the {PRODUCT} BPMN designer, you can modify the following properties for a selected script task:

.Script task properties
[cols="30%,70%", options="header"]
|===
|Label
|Description

| *Name*
| Enter the name of the task.

| *Documentation*
| Enter a description of the task. The text in this field is included in the process documentation, if applicable.

| *Script*
| Enter a script in Java, JavaScript, or MVEL to be executed by the task, and select the script type.

| *Is Async*
|  Select this option if this task should be invoked asynchronously. Make tasks asynchronous if they cannot be executed instantaneously, for example, a task performed by an outside service.

| *Adhoc Autostart*
| Select this option if this is an ad hoc task that should be started automatically. This option enables the task to automatically start when the process or case instance is created instead of being started by a start task.

User task::
+
--
A user task is an activity in the process workflow that cannot be performed automatically by the system and therefore requires the intervention of a human user, or _actor_.

On execution, the user task element is instantiated as a task that appears in the list of tasks of one or more actors. If a user task element defines the `Groups` property, the task is displayed in task lists of all users that are members of the group. Any user who is a member of the group can claim the task. After a user task is claimed, the task disappears from the task list of the other users.

In the {PRODUCT} BPMN designer, you can modify the following properties for a selected user task:

.User task properties
[cols="30%,70%", options="header"]
|===
|Label
|Description

| *Name*
| Enter the name of the task.

| *Documentation*
| Enter a description of the task. The text in this field is included in the process documentation, if applicable.

| *Task Name*
| Enter the name of the task as it is displayed to human user (actor).

| *Subject*
| Enter a subject for the task.

| *Actors*
| Click *Add* to add a row and then select an actor from the list or click *New* to add a new actor. The actors can complete the user task.

| *Groups*
| Click *Add* to add a row and then select a group from the list or click *New* to add a new group. Any actor in the group can complete the user task.

| *Assignments*
| Click to open the *Data I/O* window and add data input and output as required.

| *Reassignments*
| Click to specify a different actor to complete this task.

| *Notifications*
| Click to specify notifications associated with the task.

| *Is Async*
|  Select this option if this task should be invoked asynchronously. Make tasks asynchronous if they cannot be executed instantaneously, for example, a task performed by an outside service.

| *Skippable*
| Select this option if this task is not mandatory.

| *Priority*
| Enter a priority for the task.

| *Description*
| Enter a description of the task as it is displayed to a human user (actor).

| *Created By*
| Click *Add* to add a row and then select a user from the list or click *New* to add a new user.

| *Adhoc Autostart*
| Select this option if this is an ad hoc task that should be started automatically. This option enables the task to automatically start when the process or case instance is created instead of being starting by a start task.

| *Multiple Instance*
| Select this option if this task has multiple instances.

| *On Entry Action*
| Enter a Java, JavaScript, or MVEL script that specifies an action at the start of the task.

| *On Exit Action*
| Enter a Java, JavaScript, or MVEL script that specifies an action at the end of the task.

Service task::

.None task
None tasks are completed on activation. This is a conceptual model only. A none task is never actually executed by an IT system.
