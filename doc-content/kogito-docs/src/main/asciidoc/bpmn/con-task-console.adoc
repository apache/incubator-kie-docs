You can use the Task Console to view your list of assigned tasks, view the task details for each task, and move the task to the next phase of the task life cycle. For more information about the task life cycle, see xref:con-task-life-cycle_kogito-developing-process-services[].

The Task Console requires your {PRODUCT} services to use the {PRODUCT} Data Index Service. The Data Index Service enables the Task Console to access stored events related to tasks and domain data from your {PRODUCT} services. The {PRODUCT} Data Index Service requires Infinispan persistence and Apache Kafka messaging for your {PRODUCT} service. For more information about the Data Index Service, see
