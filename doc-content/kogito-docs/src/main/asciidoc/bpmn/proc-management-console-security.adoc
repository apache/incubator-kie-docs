= Enabling {PRODUCT} Management Console security with OpenID Connect

{PRODUCT} Management Console is prepared to work with security enabled, and interact with the {PRODUCT} Data Index Service using bearer token authorization. These tokens are issued by OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0 compliant authorization servers such as https://www.keycloak.org/about.html[Keycloak].

IMPORTANT: This procedure applies only when you are using a locally cloned copy of the https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-apps/tree/master/management-console[{PRODUCT} Management Console Service] repository in GitHub.

.Prerequisites
* You have cloned the https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-apps/tree/master/management-console[{PRODUCT}Management Console Service] repository from GitHub.

.Procedure
In a command terminal, navigate to the local clone of the {PRODUCT} Management Console Service repository, redefine the required security properties, and enter the following command:

[source]
----
mvn clean compile quarkus:dev -Dkogito.auth.enabled=true
----

IMPORTANT: Make sure the service is not started at the same port as the security server. The port can be changed adding -Dquarkus.http.port=8380

If the `kogito.auth.enabled=true` setting is not added, the OpenID Connect extension is disabled.

The default security properties values are:
[source]
----
kogito.auth.enabled=false
kogito.auth.keycloak.url=http://localhost:8280
kogito.auth.keycloak.realm=kogito
kogito.auth.keycloak.client.id=kogito-console-quarkus
----

To change the default values: navigate to `applications.properties` file and replace any property definition with those of your specific environment:

* `kogito.auth.keycloak.url`: The base URL of the OpenID Connect (OIDC) server, such as `https://localhost:8280`. All other OIDC server page and service URLs are derived from this URL. If you work with Keycloak OIDC server, ensure that the base URL is in the following format: `https://__HOST__:__PORT__`.
* `kogito.auth.keycloak.realm`: The realm identifier.
* `kogito.auth.keycloak.client.id`: The client ID of the application. Each application has a client ID that is used to identify the application.
