= Custom tasks supported in {PRODUCT}

The BPMN specification supports the ability to extend the `bpmn2:task` element to create custom tasks in a software implementation. Similar to standard BPMN tasks, custom tasks identify actions to be completed in a business process model, but they also include specialized functionality, such as compatibility with an external service of a specific type (REST, email, or web service) or checkpoint behavior within a process (milestone).

{PRODUCT} provides predefined custom tasks under *Custom Tasks* in the BPMN modeler palette, but currently does not support the ability for you to define your own custom task extensions.

{PRODUCT} currently supports the following predefined custom tasks:

Milestone::
+
--
A milestone represents a single point of achievement within a process instance. You can use milestones to flag certain events to trigger other tasks or track the progress of the process. Milestones are useful for Key Performance Indicator (KPI) tracking or for identifying the tasks that are still to be completed. Milestones can occur at the end of a stage in a process or they can be the result of achieving other milestones.

A milestone typically uses a defined input condition that must be met in order to complete the milestone. If no input condition is defined, the milestone is completed automatically when the process reaches the milestone. You can also configure milestones with the `AdHoc Autostart` property to be triggered automatically when the process starts or you can set the *Signal* definition in a signal event in the process to trigger the milestone explicitly. Milestones can be triggered as many times as required. A milestone is achieved when the condition is met or is achieved automatically if no condition is defined.

In the following example process, several milestones control the process for IT hardware orders. For example, when the condition for the `Order placed` milestone is met, the completed milestone triggers a notification script task and leads to an end signal event that triggers the next `Order shipped` milestone, and so on to subsequent milestones until the process is complete.

Milestones can reach the following states during process execution:

* `Active`: A milestone condition has been defined for the milestone node but it has not been met.
* `Completed`: A milestone condition has been met (if applicable), the milestone has been achieved, and the process can proceed to the next task or can end.
//* `Terminated`: The milestone is no longer a part of the process and is no longer required.

In the {PRODUCT} BPMN modeler, you can modify the following properties for a selected milestone:

.Milestone properties
[cols="30%,70%", options="header"]
|===
|Label
|Description

| *Name*
| Identifies the name of the milestone.

| *Documentation*
| Describes the milestone. The text in this field is included in the process documentation, if applicable.

| *Is Async*
|  Determines whether this milestone is invoked asynchronously. Make milestones asynchronous if they cannot be executed instantaneously, such as in a process performed by an outside service.

| *AdHoc Autostart*
| Determines whether this is an ad hoc milestone that is started automatically. This option enables the milestone to automatically start when the process is created instead of being started by a signal event.

| *On Entry Action*
| Not supported in {PRODUCT}. This property defines a Java, JavaScript, or MVEL script that directs an action at the start of the milestone, and is currently available only in distributions of the BPMN modeler in jBPM and Red Hat Process Automation Manager.

| *On Exit Action*
| Not supported in {PRODUCT}. This property defines a Java, JavaScript, or MVEL script that directs an action at the end of the milestone, and is currently available only in distributions of the BPMN modeler in jBPM and Red Hat Process Automation Manager.

| *SLA Due Date*
| Specifies the date when the service level agreement (SLA) expires.

| *Assignments*
a| Defines data input and output for the milestone. Click to open the *Data I/O* window and add data input and output as required. A milestone typically uses a defined input condition that must be met in order to complete the milestone. If no input condition is defined, the milestone is completed automatically when the process reaches the milestone.

For each milestone that requires a condition, enter at least one input data assignment with the following values:

* *Name*: `Condition`
* *Data Type*: `String`
* *Source*: Enter a Java expression for the condition to be met, such as `order.isShipped()` in a process that uses an `order` process variable.
