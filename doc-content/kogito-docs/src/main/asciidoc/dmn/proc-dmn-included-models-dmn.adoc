= Including other DMN models within a DMN file in the {PRODUCT} VSCode DMN modeler

In the {PRODUCT} DMN modeler in VSCode, you can include other DMN models from the same directory of your {PRODUCT} project in a specified DMN file. When you include a DMN model within another DMN file, you can use all of the nodes and logic from both models in the same decision requirements diagram (DRD), but you cannot edit the nodes from the included model. To edit nodes from included models, you must update the source file for the included model directly. If you update the source file for an included DMN model, open the DMN file where the DMN model is included (or close and re-open) to verify the changes.

You cannot include DMN models from different directories within your {PRODUCT} project or from other {PRODUCT} projects.

.Prerequisites
* The DMN models are created or imported (as `.dmn` files) in the same directory of your {PRODUCT} project as the DMN file in which you want to include the models, such as in `src/main/resources`.

.Procedure
. In your VSCode IDE, open the DMN file to view the decision requirements diagram (DRD) in the {PRODUCT} DMN modeler.
+
--
If the DRD does not open in the {PRODUCT} DMN modeler, ensure that you have installed and enabled the *{PRODUCT} Bundle* VSCode extension.

If the {PRODUCT} DMN modeler opens only the XML source of the DMN file and displays an error message, review the reported errors and the DMN model file to ensure that all DMN elements are correctly defined.
--
. In the DMN modeler, click the *Included Models* tab.
. Click *Include Model*, select a DMN model from your directory in the *Models* list, enter a unique name for the included model, and click *Include*:

The DMN model is added to this DMN file, and all DRD nodes from the included model are listed under *Decision Components* in the *Decision Navigator* view:

All data types from the included model are also listed in read-only mode in the *Data Types* tab for the DMN file:

. In the *Editor* tab of the DMN modeler, click and drag the included DRD components onto the canvas to begin implementing them in your DRD:

To edit DRD nodes or data types from included models, you must update the source file for the included model directly. If you update the source file for an included DMN model, open the DMN file where the DMN model is included (or close and re-open) to verify the changes.

To edit the included model name or to remove the included model from the DMN file, use the *Included Models* tab in the DMN modeler.

IMPORTANT: When you remove an included model, any nodes from that included model that are currently used in the DRD are also removed.
