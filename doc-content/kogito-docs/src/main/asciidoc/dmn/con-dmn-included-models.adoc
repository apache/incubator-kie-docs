= Included models in DMN files in the {PRODUCT} VSCode DMN modeler

In the {PRODUCT} DMN modeler in VSCode, you can use the *Included Models* tab to include other DMN models and Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) models from your project in a specified DMN file. When you include a DMN model within another DMN file, you can use all of the nodes and logic from both models in the same decision requirements diagram (DRD). When you include a PMML model within a DMN file, you can invoke that PMML model as a boxed function expression for a DMN decision node or business knowledge model node.

You cannot include DMN or PMML models from different directories within your {PRODUCT} project or from other {PRODUCT} projects.

NOTE: Included models are supported in the {PRODUCT} DMN modeler in VSCode only. In other {PRODUCT} modeling tools, such as the Business Modeler desktop application or Business Modeler online viewer, the {PRODUCT} DMN modeler does not support DMN or PMML included models.
