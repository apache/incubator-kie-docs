= Configurable DMN validation in {PRODUCT}

By default, the Kogito CodeGen of your {PRODUCT} project uses the following `kogito.decisions.validation` configuration flag to perform pre-compilation validation of DMN model assets and to perform DMN decision table static analysis:

* DMN model files are verified against the DMN specification XSD schema to ensure that the files are valid XML and compliant with the specification.
* The pre-compilation analysis is performed for the DMN model to ensure that the basic semantic is aligned with the DMN specification.
* DMN decision tables are statically analyzed for gaps or overlaps and to ensure that the semantic of the decision table follows best practices.

You can modify the default DMN validation and DMN decision table analysis behavior to ignore any error, or you can disable this default behavior completely, as shown in the following examples:

.Default configuration for DMN validation and decision table analysis
[source]
----
kogito.decisions.validation=ENABLED
----

Any DMN validation error will cause the Kogito CodeGen build to fail and errors to be reported accordingly, as in the following example screenshot:

.Configuration to ignore any DMN validation error
[source]
----
kogito.decisions.validation=IGNORE
----

.Configuration to disable all DMN validation
[source]
----
kogito.decisions.validation=DISABLED
----

NOTE: If you enter an unrecognized `kogito.decisions.validation` configuration flag, all pre-compilation validation features are disabled and the Kogito CodeGen emits a related log message.
