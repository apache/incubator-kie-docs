You can use the Audit Investigation Console to browse DMN model executions, verify execution status, retrieve execution details, such as decision outcomes, input data, and model preview, and obtain explanation information about how the processed decisions were made.

The Audit Investigation Console requires your {PRODUCT} services to use the following {PRODUCT} components:

* *{PRODUCT} Trusty Service*: Enables the Audit Investigation Console to access stored events related to decision tracing from your {PRODUCT} services. The {PRODUCT} Trusty Service requires Infinispan persistence and Apache Kafka messaging for your {PRODUCT} service. For more information about the Trusty Service, see

* *{PRODUCT} Explainability Service*: Generates explainability data that is stored in the {PRODUCT} Trusty Service. The Audit Investigation Console accesses the explainbility information from tracing-event data for decisions in your {PRODUCT} services. The {PRODUCT} Explainbility Service requires Apache Kafka messaging for your {PRODUCT} service.
* *{PRODUCT} Tracing decision add-on*: Enables the {PRODUCT} service to produce tracing events and publish the events to Apache Kafka. The add-on also exposes the REST endpoint `/predict` for the {PRODUCT} Explainbility Service.
