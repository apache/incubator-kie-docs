= Defining list values in test scenarios

When data types in Decision Model and Notation (DMN) models are configured as `List` types, you can set the values of the list for that data object in the corresponding test scenario. You can define list values in cells for both *GIVEN* and *EXPECT* columns.

.Procedure
. In your VSCode IDE, open the DMN file that contains the decisions that you want to test and select the *Data Types* tab to view the data types for that DMN model.
. Add or modify a data type of any kind, toggle the *List* option to define the data type as a list, and save the DMN file.
+
--
For example, the following `State` data type is part of a DMN model for determining fine amounts and driver suspension in a traffic violation decision service. In this case, the `State` data type is defined as a `List` type so that the relevant states can be explicitly listed in the decision service or test scenarios.

.Example `State` data type as a list

--
. Add or modify a test scenario (`.scesim`) file that corresponds to the DMN decision service and insert the DMN data type that you defined as a `List` type in a relevant *GIVEN* or *EXPECT* header cell.
+
--
For example, the following `TrafficViolationTest.scesim` test scenario file uses the *Driver* -> *State* data object defined previously as a `List` type as part of the *GIVEN* parameters for the traffic violation scenarios.

. Double-click a value cell in the column and in the window that appears, select from the following options:
+
--
* *Create List*: Use this option to create a list using the guided form in the window. Select *Add list value* to begin adding list values.
* *Define List*: Use this option to define a list as a Friendly Enough Expression Language (FEEL) literal expression.

. Click *Save* in the list window to save the list values.

The value for the selected cell in the test scenario is now defined with the new list:
