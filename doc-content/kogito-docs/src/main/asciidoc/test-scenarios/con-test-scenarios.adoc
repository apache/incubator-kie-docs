= Test scenarios in {PRODUCT}

Test scenarios in {PRODUCT} enable you to validate the functionality of business decisions and business decision data during project development. With a test scenario, you use data from your project to set given conditions and expected results based on one or more defined business decisions. When you run the scenario, the expected results and actual results of the decision instance are compared. If the expected results match the actual results, the test is successful. If the expected results do not match the actual results, then the test fails.

You define test scenarios in `.scesim` (scenario simulation) files that you can model in Visual Studio Code (VSCode) using the {PRODUCT} https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-tooling/releases[VSCode extension]. You can use one or multiple `.scesim` files in your {PRODUCT} project, and each `.scesim` file can contain one or multiple test scenarios based on the defined decision data.

When you run the test scenarios in your {PRODUCT} project, all test scenarios in all `.scesim` files are run as part of the same command. However, individual test scenarios are independent, so one scenario cannot affect or modify another. You can run test scenarios at any time during project development. You do not need to compile or deploy your decision service to run test scenarios, but your {PRODUCT} project needs to be compilable and free from build errors.

//@comment: Excluding the following until DRL-based scenarios are supported. (Stetson, 8 May 2020)
//All data objects related to a test scenario must be in the same project package as the test scenario. Data objects in the same package are imported by default.

IMPORTANT: Test scenarios in {PRODUCT} currently support DMN decision services only. Test scenarios will support Drools Rule Language (DRL) decision services in a future release.
