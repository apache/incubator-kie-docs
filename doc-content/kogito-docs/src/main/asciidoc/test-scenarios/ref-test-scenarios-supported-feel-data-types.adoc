= Supported FEEL data types in DMN test scenarios

The {PRODUCT} test scenario modeler supports the following Friendly Enough Expression Language (FEEL) data types for Decision Model and Notation (DMN) test scenarios:

[width="",cols="3,6"]
|===
|Supported data types | Description

|Numbers
|Numbers based on the http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4610935/[IEEE 754-2008] Decimal 128 format, with additional number notations extended by {PRODUCT}, such as `1.2e3` for `1.2*10**3` (scientific) and `0xff` for `255` (hexadecimal)

|Strings
|Any sequence of characters delimited by double quotation marks, such as `"John Doe"`, `"Brno"`, and `""`

|Boolean values
|`true`, `false`, and `null`.

|Dates, time, and date and time
|Date literals, time literals, and combined date and time literals, such as `date("2019-05-13")`, `time("14:10:00+02:00")`, and `date and time( "2019-05-13T23:59:00" )`

|Years and months duration, days and time duration
|Duration strings for years, months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds that follow the format defined in the https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#duration[XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes] document, such as `duration( "P2Y" )` for year, `duration( "P3Y5M" )` for year and month, `duration( "P23D" )` for days, `duration( "PT12H" )` for hours, and `duration( "P1DT23H12M30S" )` for days, hours, minutes, and seconds.

|Functions
|Built-in math functions, such as `avg` and `max`, or variables of functions extended by {PRODUCT}, such as `function(a, b) a + b`

|Contexts
|Lists of key and value pairs, such as `{x : 5, y : 3}` and `{x : 5, even : false, type : "integer number"}`

|Ranges and lists
|Range literals and list literals, such as `[1 .. 10]` and `[2, 3, 4, 5]`
