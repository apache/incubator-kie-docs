= New features in {PRODUCT} 1.24

[role="_abstract"]
The following sections describe some of the new features or enhancements in {PRODUCT} 1.24.

== {PRODUCT} runtimes

=== {PRODUCT} change in DMN/Decisions code generated OAS/Swagger type names

In the previous versions of {PRODUCT}, model-specific OAS/Swagger type names generated from DMN/Decisions models used a number-based format, for example `InputSet1`, `InputSet2`, etc.
However, this format has some limitations impacting external clients and external plugins across evolutions of the Kogito application being developed. For example, adding or removing DMN/Decisions models from your Kogito application does not guarantee a stable naming and ordering across evolutions of your Kogito application.

Starting from {PRODUCT} 1.24.0, the model-specific OAS/Swagger type names by default will now be based on the names of the DMN/Decisions models themselves, for example, `InputSetLoan`, `InputSetValidation`, etc.
In the case of two DMN/Decisions models sharing the same name, it will automatically fall back to the previous number-based format. In addition, the number-based format strategy now accounts for the DMN/Decisions models to be ordered by their namespace and name, to maximize stable naming results in the OAS/Swagger definitions file.

NOTE: No change is required from a Kogito application development perspective.

This is an effective convenient improvement while integrating your Kogito-based application with external tools, clients, and plugins. For more information, see https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KOGITO-7154[KOGITO-7154].

=== {PRODUCT} changes in `KogitoProcessEventListener` behaviour

Starting from this release, any `KogitoProcessEventListener` registered in {PRODUCT} runtime, will immediately be executed once the engine triggers an event. Previously, it would be enlisted as a part of the `UnitOfWork` and only be executed once the work was completed. To achieve a similar behavior, it is recommended to use an `EventPublisher`.

=== {PRODUCT} persistence support for process versions

Basic support for Process versions is included in this release. This includes adding a new `process_version` column in the database. Initially,
version support is only available on `jdbc` and `postgresql` persistence addons. By default, version support will persist the version from the BPMN or SW file. This means, that processes are individually versioned and the lifecycle of it can be manually tweaked as needed.
Another strategy is to use the project version for all the processes. This can be achieved by setting `kogito.workflow.version-strategy=project` in the application.properties. This strategy uses the project version as the version for all processes contained in the project. For instance, changing a Maven project version would automatically update the version of all processes it contains.
The versioning process allows isolating different runtimes sharing the same database. This means that different runtimes, running different process versions would not be able to retrieve information from any process that does not belong to the same process version in execution.
