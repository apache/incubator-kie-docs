=== Example application for {PRODUCT} Serverless Workflow to demonstrate SAGA pattern

In {PRODUCT} 1.16.0, a new example application is added to demonstrate how to use Serverless Workflow to implement the SAGA pattern.
The https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/tree/stable/kogito-quarkus-examples/serverless-workflow-saga-quarkus[serverless-workflow-saga-quarkus] example application is based on Quarkus runtime.

=== {PRODUCT} Serverless Workflow support for state data filters

The {PRODUCT} runtime support is now expanded to the Serverless Workflow specification by implementing support to state data filters. For more information about the usage of data filters, see the {SERVERLESS_WORKFLOW_REPO_URL_BASE}/blob/0.6.x/specification.md#State-data-filters[specification].

You can also see the https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/tree/1.16.x/kogito-quarkus-examples/serverless-workflow-foreach-quarkus[serverless-workflow-foreach-quarkus] example application on how to use state data filters in your {PRODUCT} project.

=== {PRODUCT} Serverless Workflow data merging support for action data filters

The {PRODUCT} runtime support is now expanded to the Serverless Workflow specification by implementing support to {SERVERLESS_WORKFLOW_REPO_URL_BASE}/blob/0.6.x/specification.md#Data-Merging[data merging] for {SERVERLESS_WORKFLOW_REPO_URL_BASE}/blob/0.6.x/specification.md#action-data-filters[action data filters].

For more information on how to use data merging and action data filters, see the https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/tree/1.16.x/kogito-quarkus-examples/serverless-workflow-expression-quarkus[serverless-workflow-expression-quarkus] example application.

=== {PRODUCT} Serverless Workflow support for data merging and event data filters

The {PRODUCT} runtime support is now expanded to the Serverless Workflow specification by implementing support for {SERVERLESS_WORKFLOW_REPO_URL_BASE}/blob/0.6.x/specification.md#event-data-filters[event data filters] and {SERVERLESS_WORKFLOW_REPO_URL_BASE}/blob/0.6.x/specification.md#data-merging[data merging] for the events in business processes.

For more information about how to use event data filters and data merging, see the https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/tree/1.16.x/kogito-quarkus-examples/serverless-workflow-callback-quarkus[serverless-workflow-callback-quarkus] example application.
