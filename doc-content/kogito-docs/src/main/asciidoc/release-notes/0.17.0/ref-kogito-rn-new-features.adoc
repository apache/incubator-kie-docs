= New features in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}

The following sections describe some of the new features or enhancements in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}.

== {PRODUCT} runtimes

=== KIE DMN validation in {PRODUCT}

The {PRODUCT} CodeGen component now performs DMN decision table static analysis, in addition to pre-compilation validation of DMN model assets.

With this enhancement, the {PRODUCT} CodeGen component now includes the following features for pre-compilation and DMN decision table static analysis:

* DMN model files are verified against the DMN specification XSD schema to ensure that the files are valid XML and compliant with the specification.
* The pre-compilation analysis is performed for the DMN model to ensure that the basic semantic is aligned with the DMN specification.
* DMN decision tables are statically analyzed for gaps or overlaps and to ensure that the semantic of the decision table follows best practices.

You can modify the default DMN validation and DMN decision table analysis behavior to ignore errors during the project build, or you can disable this default behavior completely, as shown in the following examples:

.Default configuration for DMN validation and decision table analysis
[source]
----
kogito.decisions.validation=ENABLED
----

.Configuration to validate DMN models and DMN decision tables but ignore errors
[source]
----
kogito.decisions.validation=IGNORE
----

.Configuration to disable all DMN validation
[source]
----
kogito.decisions.validation=DISABLED
----

NOTE: If you enter an unrecognized `kogito.decisions.validation` configuration flag, all pre-compilation validation features are disabled and the {PRODUCT} CodeGen emits related log messages.

=== {PRODUCT} Management Console enhancements

The {PRODUCT} Management Console contains the following key enhancements:

* *New _Node Trigger_ panel in process details*: In the *Process Details* page of a selected process instance, a new *Node Trigger* panel now provides a drop-down menu with available process nodes that you can trigger. When you select an available node from the menu, details about the node are displayed in the panel and you can click *Trigger* to trigger the node.

* *New job _Reschedule_ option in _Jobs_ panel*: For jobs in a *Scheduled* or an *Error* state in the *Jobs* panel, you can select the *Reschedule* option to reschedule the jobs. You can modify the expiration time for one-time jobs, or the expiration time, repeat interval, and repeat limit for periodic jobs.
