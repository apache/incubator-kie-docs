[role="_abstract"]
The following sections describe some of the new features or enhancements in {PRODUCT} 1.10.

== {PRODUCT} runtimes

=== Breaking change on {PRODUCT} PostgreSQL add-on for Quarkus

The usage of `kogito.persistence.postgresql.connection.uri` is discontinued in 1.9.0 when using PostgreSQL add-on for Quarkus. You can use the same configuration using https://quarkus.io/guides/reactive-sql-clients#reactive-datasource[Quarkus reactive datasource].

.Example of how to configure the datasource in the application.properties file:
[source]
------
quarkus.datasource.reactive.url=postgresql://localhost:5432/kogito
quarkus.datasource.username=kogito-user
quarkus.datasource.password=kogito-pass
------

=== Breaking change on {PRODUCT} Management and Task Consoles

The GraphQL endpoint URL now requires the entire path, for example, `http://host-name:port-number/graphql`. You can pass the URL as an environment variable `kogito.dataindex.http.url` to the Quarkus application or image.

=== Persistence script bundle

Persistence setup scripts for {PRODUCT} runtimes and {PRODUCT} runtimes supporting services are now included in the https://repository.jboss.org/org/kie/kogito/kogito-ddl/{COMMUNITY_VERSION_FINAL}/[kogito-ddl-{COMMUNITY_VERSION_FINAL}-db-scripts.zip] artifact.
