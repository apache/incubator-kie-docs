=== New process instance read modes in {PRODUCT}

You can now specify one of the following read modes in the {PRODUCT} `ProcessInstances` interface:

* `ProcessInstanceReadMode.MUTABLE`: (Default) Use this mode to perform operations on a process instance, such as aborting the process or updating process variables.
* `ProcessInstanceReadMode.READ_ONLY`: Use this mode to review the state and variables of a process instance without performing operations on it.

Depending on the read mode that you select, you can use one of the following methods to load the process instances accordingly:

* `findById`: Loads a specific process instance in `MUTABLE` mode by default
* `values`: Loads all process instances in `READ_ONLY` mode by default

.Read modes in `ProcessInstances` interface
[source, java]
----
public interface ProcessInstances<T> {

    default Optional<ProcessInstance<T>> findById(String id) {
            return findById(id, ProcessInstanceReadMode.MUTABLE);
        }

    Optional<ProcessInstance<T>> findById(String id, ProcessInstanceReadMode mode);

    default Collection<ProcessInstance<T>> values(){
        return values(ProcessInstanceReadMode.READ_ONLY);
    }
    
    Collection<ProcessInstance<T>> values(ProcessInstanceReadMode mode);
    
}
----

When you load instances in `READ_ONLY` mode, the {PRODUCT} process engine bypasses all the initialization that is typically required when you are modifying a process instance state so that you can review process instance data more efficiently. If you attempt to perform operations on process instances that are loaded in `READ_ONLY` mode, the {PRODUCT} runtime behaves unexpectedly. To perform operations on a process instance, ensure that you use `MUTABLE` mode.
