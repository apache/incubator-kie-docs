= New features in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}

The following sections describe some of the new features or enhancements in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}.

== {PRODUCT} runtimes

=== New process instance read modes in {PRODUCT}

You can now specify one of the following read modes in the {PRODUCT} `ProcessInstances` interface:

* `ProcessInstanceReadMode.MUTABLE`: (Default) Use this mode to perform operations on a process instance, such as aborting the process or updating process variables.
* `ProcessInstanceReadMode.READ_ONLY`: Use this mode to review the state and variables of a process instance without performing operations on it.

Depending on the read mode that you select, you can use one of the following methods to load the process instances accordingly:

* `findById`: Loads a specific process instance in `MUTABLE` mode by default
* `values`: Loads all process instances in `READ_ONLY` mode by default

.Read modes in `ProcessInstances` interface
[source, java]
----
public interface ProcessInstances<T> {

    default Optional<ProcessInstance<T>> findById(String id) {
            return findById(id, ProcessInstanceReadMode.MUTABLE);
        }

    Optional<ProcessInstance<T>> findById(String id, ProcessInstanceReadMode mode);

    default Collection<ProcessInstance<T>> values(){
        return values(ProcessInstanceReadMode.READ_ONLY);
    }

    Collection<ProcessInstance<T>> values(ProcessInstanceReadMode mode);

}
----

When you load instances in `READ_ONLY` mode, the {PRODUCT} process engine bypasses all the initialization that is typically required when you are modifying a process instance state so that you can review process instance data more efficiently. If you attempt to perform operations on process instances that are loaded in `READ_ONLY` mode, the {PRODUCT} runtime behaves unexpectedly. To perform operations on a process instance, ensure that you use `MUTABLE` mode.

=== New filter options in {PRODUCT} Management Console and improved option to manage columns

In the *Domain Explorer* page of the {PRODUCT} Management Console, you can now filter domain-related data based on attributes from a given domain. The console provides three drop-down options that you can use to select an attribute, an operator, and the value on which the domain data is filtered.

.Example domain data filter by attribute, operator, and value

Options for operators and values are dependent on the attribute selected and might vary based on the type of attribute selected.

You can also sort the domain data in the table in ascending or descending order by clicking the sort icon near the column names.

The Management Console also provides an enhanced *Manage columns* feature that enables you to modify the columns in the table. This enhancement replaces the former drop-down approach and provides an improved interface for modal and grouped lists.

=== Keycloak integration with the {PRODUCT} Management Console

The {PRODUCT} Management Console now supports OpenID connection security integration with Keycloak. This enhancement enables you to expose the context with user-related data, such as roles and permissions, that is managed in a Keycloak server.
