// IMPORTANT: For 1.10 and later, save each version release notes as its own module file in the release-notes folder that this `ReleaseNotesKogito<version>.adoc` file is in, and then include each version release notes file in the chap-kogito-release-notes.adoc after Additional resources of {PRODUCT} deployment on {OPENSHIFT} section, in the following format:
//include::ReleaseNotesKogito.<version>/ReleaseNotesKogito.<version>.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

= New features in {PRODUCT} 1.23

[role="_abstract"]
The following sections describe some of the new features or enhancements in {PRODUCT} 1.23.


== {PRODUCT} runtimes

=== {PRODUCT} runtime persistence allows to use Java serialization instead protobuf definitions

Starting from {PRODUCT} 1.23.0, runtime persistence will allow using Java objects serialization instead of custom marshallers and protobuf definitions.
To enable this feature, set `kogito.persistence.proto.marshaller=false` in your application.properties file.
This mode requires all the process variables using custom data types to implement `java.io.Serializable` and it is not compatible with data persisted using
protobuf definitions.

For more information, see {URL_PROCESS_SERVICES}#con-persistence_kogito-developing-process-services[Persistence in {PRODUCT} services].

=== Source files addon: Added endpoint to get source file content and changed get sources rest endpoint URL

A new endpoint to get the specific process source file content has been added to the Source files addon.

Source files add-on endpoint url to get the source files have been changed from ‘/management/process/{Id}/sources’ to ‘/management/processes/{processId}/sources’
to be aligned with the other management rest endpoints.

For more information, see {URL_PROCESS_SERVICES}#source-files-add-on[{PRODUCT} source files add-on].

=== {PRODUCT} Data Index service Gateway API incorporates a new call to get the process source file content

A new call to {PRODUCT} runtimes services to get the specific process source file content have been added to the Data Index Gateway API.

For more information, see {URL_PROCESS_SERVICES}#proc-data-index-service-runtime-connection_kogito-configuring[Data Index service Gateway API].
