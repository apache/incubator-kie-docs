= New features in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}

The following sections describe some of the new features or enhancements in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}.

== {PRODUCT} runtimes

=== Support for MongoDB runtime persistence

As an alternative to using Infinispan for {PRODUCT} runtime persistence, you can now enable persistence for your {PRODUCT} services using https://www.mongodb.com/[MongoDB]. For {PRODUCT} persistence with MongoDB, you must have a MongoDB Server installed and running in order to enable persistence.

With this enhancement, the following new example applications are available to demonstrate {PRODUCT} services with MongoDB persistence:

* https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/tree/stable/process-mongodb-persistence-quarkus[`process-mongodb-persistence-quarkus`]: Example on Quarkus
* https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/tree/stable/process-mongodb-persistence-springboot[`process-mongodb-persistence-springboot`]: Example on Spring Boot

=== Support for managing process variables in {PRODUCT} Management Console

In the {PRODUCT} Management Console, when you select a process instance name to view the *Process Details* page, you can now use the *Process Variables* panel to add, update, or delete variables and save the changes to the process instance.

=== Redesigned load more in {PRODUCT} Management Console
In the {PRODUCT} Management Console, load more is used to select the desired value of more instances to be loaded. It is added as a dropdown in the bottom-right corner of the page. 

.Load more with dropdown options

=== Support for bulk Skip and Retry actions in {PRODUCT} Management Console

In the {PRODUCT} Management Console, at Process Instance List two new bulk operations have been added: Skip and Retry. When you select all the relevant process instances, you can now perform the actions: Abort, Skip and Retry on the selected instances.

=== Added jobs panel in {PRODUCT} Management Console

In the {PRODUCT} Management Console, the process instance related jobs list has been added to the *Process Details* page. To view more details of the job, use the kebab-dropdown and click on the *Details*.

== {PRODUCT} supporting services

=== {PRODUCT} Data Index Service support for MongoDB persistence storage

You can now configure the {PRODUCT} Data Index Service to use https://www.mongodb.com/[MongoDB] for persistence storage instead of the default Infinispan-based persistence storage.

With this enhancement, the https://repository.jboss.org/org/kie/kogito/data-index-service/[`data-index-service`] artifact is deprecated and the following new artifacts are available:

* https://repository.jboss.org/org/kie/kogito/data-index-service-infinispan/[`data-index-service-infinispan`]: Use this artifact to run the Data Index Service with Infinispan persistence storage.
* https://repository.jboss.org/org/kie/kogito/data-index-service-mongodb/[`data-index-service-mongodb`]: Use this artifact to run the Data Index Service with MongoDB persistence storage.

For more information about using the {PRODUCT} Data Index Service with MongoDB, see

ifdef::KOGITO-COMM[]
xref:proc-data-index-service-mongodb_kogito-configuring[].
endif::[]

=== Support for enabling or disabling security at runtime in {PRODUCT} Data Index Service and Jobs Service

To align with Quarkus improvements, {PRODUCT} now provides a new OpenID Connect configuration in the {PRODUCT} Data Index Service and
{PRODUCT} Jobs Service to enable or disable security at runtime. Before this enhancement, you could enable or disable security for these services only at build time.

For more information about enabling security in the {PRODUCT} Data Index Service, see 
ifdef::KOGITO[]
