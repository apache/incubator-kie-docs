= New features in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}

The following sections describe some of the new features or enhancements in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}.

== {PRODUCT} runtimes

=== Support for Serverless Workflow orchestration

{PRODUCT} now provides the runtime implementation that supports https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/specification/blob/master/specification.md[Serverless Workflow], including both JSON and YAML formats, in compliance with the https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/specification[Serverless Workflow specification].

Serverless Workflow is a specification for defining declarative workflow models that orchestrate event-driven, serverless applications. You can use Serverless Workflow definition files in your {PRODUCT} project to define your domain-specific orchestration services. Your Serverless Workflow files can be in JSON or YAML format with the extension `.sw.json` or `.sw.yaml`.

For more information about Serverless Workflow orchestration in {PRODUCT}, see
ifdef::KOGITO[]
{URL_ORCHESTRATING_SERVICES}[_{ORCHESTRATING_SERVICES}_].

endif::[]

=== Support for Knative Eventing in {PRODUCT} process services

{PRODUCT} now provides a `knative-eventing-addon` add-on that enables you to use https://knative.dev/docs/eventing/[Knative Eventing] with {PRODUCT} services that consume or publish messages within a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) process model. Knative Eventing is a system that enables you to create event producers and consumers for your applications.

When the Knative Eventing add-on is enabled in a {PRODUCT} project that contains a process with message events, an event consumer is generated from the message start node and an event producer is generated from the message end node at build time. You can use these event consumers and producers as part of your {PRODUCT} service deployment in a Knative Eventing environment on Kubernetes or OpenShift clusters.

Knative Eventing is currently supported for {PRODUCT} services on Quarkus only.

For more information about Knative Eventing in {PRODUCT} services, see

=== Support for MongoDB runtime persistence

As an alternative to using Infinispan for {PRODUCT} runtime persistence, you can now enable persistence for your {PRODUCT} services using https://www.mongodb.com/[MongoDB]. For {PRODUCT} persistence with MongoDB, you must have a MongoDB Server installed and running in order to enable persistence.

With this enhancement, the following new example applications are available to demonstrate {PRODUCT} services with MongoDB persistence:

* https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/tree/stable/process-mongodb-persistence-quarkus[`process-mongodb-persistence-quarkus`]: Example on Quarkus
* https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/tree/stable/process-mongodb-persistence-springboot[`process-mongodb-persistence-springboot`]: Example on Spring Boot

=== New {PRODUCT} Audit Investigation Console for DMN model execution data

{PRODUCT} now provides an Audit Investigation Console for monitoring and investigating Decision Model and Notation (DMN) model executions in {PRODUCT}.

You can use the Audit Investigation Console to browse DMN model executions, verify execution status, retrieve execution details, such as decision outcomes, input data, and model preview, and obtain explanation information about how the processed decisions were made.

=== {PRODUCT} Management Console enhancements

The {PRODUCT} Management Console contains the following key enhancements:

* *Support for bulk skip and retry operations in process instances*: The Management Console now includes bulk skip and retry operations that you can apply to multiple selected process instances.
* *New _Jobs_ and _Milestones_ panels in process details*: In the *Process Details* page of a selected process instance, a new *Jobs* panel now displays job details related to a specified process instance, and a new *Milestones* panel displays available milestones and status, if applicable.

=== KIE DMN validation in {PRODUCT}

The {PRODUCT} CodeGen component now performs default pre-compilation validation of DMN model assets. The CodeGen includes the following enhancements:

* DMN model files are verified against the DMN specification XSD schema to ensure that the files are valid XML and compliant with the specification.
* The pre-compilation analysis is performed for the DMN model to ensure that the basic semantic is aligned with the DMN specification.

You can modify the default DMN validation behavior to ignore errors during the project build or you can disable the DMN validation feature completely.

.Default DMN validation configuration
[source]
----
kogito.decisions.validation=ENABLED
----

.Configuration to validate DMN models but ignore errors
[source]
----
kogito.decisions.validation=IGNORE
----

.Configuration to disable DMN validation
[source]
----
kogito.decisions.validation=DISABLED
----

NOTE: If you enter an unrecognized configuration flag, a log message is reported and the default DMN validation is performed.

== {PRODUCT} supporting services

=== {PRODUCT} Data Index Service support for MongoDB persistence storage

You can now configure the {PRODUCT} Data Index Service to use https://www.mongodb.com/[MongoDB] for persistence storage instead of the default Infinispan-based persistence storage.

With this enhancement, the https://repository.jboss.org/org/kie/kogito/data-index-service/[`data-index-service`] artifact is deprecated and the following new artifacts are available:

* https://repository.jboss.org/org/kie/kogito/data-index-service-infinispan/[`data-index-service-infinispan`]: Use this artifact to run the Data Index Service with Infinispan persistence storage.
* https://repository.jboss.org/org/kie/kogito/data-index-service-mongodb/[`data-index-service-mongodb`]: Use this artifact to run the Data Index Service with MongoDB persistence storage.

For more information about using the {PRODUCT} Data Index Service with MongoDB, see

=== Support for enabling or disabling security at runtime in {PRODUCT} Data Index Service and Jobs Service

To align with Quarkus improvements, {PRODUCT} now provides a new OpenID Connect configuration in the {PRODUCT} Data Index Service and
{PRODUCT} Jobs Service to enable or disable security at runtime. Before this enhancement, you could enable or disable security for these services only at build time.

For more information about enabling security in the {PRODUCT} Data Index Service, see

== {PRODUCT} tooling

=== PMML support in DMN included models in VSCode

You can now use the *Included Models* tab in the {PRODUCT} VSCode DMN modeler to include Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) models from your project in a specified DMN file. When you include a PMML model within a DMN file, you can invoke that PMML model as a boxed function expression for a DMN decision node or business knowledge model node.
