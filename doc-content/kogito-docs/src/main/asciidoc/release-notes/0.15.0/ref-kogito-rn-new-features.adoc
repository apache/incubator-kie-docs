= New features in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}

The following sections describe some of the new features or enhancements in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}.

== {PRODUCT} runtimes

=== Support for MongoDB runtime persistence

As an alternative to using Infinispan for {PRODUCT} runtime persistence, you can now enable persistence for your {PRODUCT} services using https://www.mongodb.com/[MongoDB]. For {PRODUCT} persistence with MongoDB, you must have a MongoDB Server installed and running in order to enable persistence.

With this enhancement, the following new example applications are available to demonstrate {PRODUCT} services with MongoDB persistence:

* https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/tree/stable/process-mongodb-persistence-quarkus[`process-mongodb-persistence-quarkus`]: Example on Quarkus
* https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/tree/stable/process-mongodb-persistence-springboot[`process-mongodb-persistence-springboot`]: Example on Spring Boot

=== Support for managing process variables in {PRODUCT} Management Console

In the {PRODUCT} Management Console, when you select a process instance name to view the *Process Details* page, you can now use the *Process Variables* panel to add, update, or delete variables and save the changes to the process instance.

=== Support for bulk Skip and Retry actions in {PRODUCT} Management Console

In the {PRODUCT} Management Console, at Process Instance List two new bulk operations have been added: Skip and Retry. When you select all the relevant process instances, you can now perform the actions: Abort, Skip and Retry on the selected instances.

=== {PRODUCT} Data Index Service support for MongoDB persistence storage

You can now configure the {PRODUCT} Data Index Service to use https://www.mongodb.com/[MongoDB] for persistence storage instead of the default Infinispan-based persistence storage.

With this enhancement, the https://repository.jboss.org/org/kie/kogito/data-index-service/[`data-index-service`] artifact is deprecated and the following new artifacts are available:

* https://repository.jboss.org/org/kie/kogito/data-index-service-infinispan/[`data-index-service-infinispan`]: Use this artifact to run the Data Index Service with Infinispan persistence storage.
* https://repository.jboss.org/org/kie/kogito/data-index-service-mongodb/[`data-index-service-mongodb`]: Use this artifact to run the Data Index Service with MongoDB persistence storage.
