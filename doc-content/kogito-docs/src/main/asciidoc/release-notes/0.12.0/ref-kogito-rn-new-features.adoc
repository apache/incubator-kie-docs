= New features in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}

The following sections describe some of the new features or enhancements in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}.

== {PRODUCT} runtimes

ifdef::KOGITO-COMM[]
=== Improved GraphQL security in the {PRODUCT} Data Index Service

When you enable security in the {PRODUCT} Data Index Service, you can now also configure the GraphQL interface endpoint and authentication requirements. The Data Index Service also now uses multi-tenant configuration to support `web-app` and `service` application types at the same time in different endpoints.

For more information about enabling security in the {PRODUCT} Data Index, see xref:proc-data-index-service-security_kogito-configuring[].

Description

== {PRODUCT} Operator and CLI

=== New `KogitoBuild` custom resource

The {PRODUCT} Operator now supports a `KogitoBuild` custom resource that you can use to build {PRODUCT} services separately before deploying them. When you use this custom resource, you can also specify the type of OpenShift Source-to-Image (S2I) build, such as from binary, from a remote Git repository, or from a local file (DMN, BPMN, or DRL). 

For an example configuration that uses the `KogitoBuild` custom resource to link builds with service deployments on OpenShift, see the https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-cloud-operator/blob/master/examples/process-quarkus-example-runtime-build.yaml[`process-quarkus-example-runtime-build.yaml`] example file.

== Integration with the Events API

When the {PRODUCT} Operator deploys a new resource, you can now view additional information about the created resources in the Kubernetes or OpenShift Events console without having to rely on the log of the {PRODUCT} Operator pod. This integration will be improved in a future release to provide more meaningful information about the operator controlled resources.

Description

== {PRODUCT} tooling

=== DMN included models in the {PRODUCT} DMN modeler in VSCode

The {PRODUCT} Decision Model and Notation (DMN) modeler in VSCode contains a new *Included Models* tab that you can use to include other DMN models from your project in a specified DMN file. When you include a DMN model within another DMN file, you can reuse the decision requirements diagram (DRD) nodes and logic of the included model in that DMN file. This enhancement helps you more efficiently integrate DMN logic between different DMN models in your project.

For more information about DMN included models in {PRODUCT}, see

=== DMN guided tour in the {PRODUCT} DMN modeler in online viewer

The {PRODUCT} Decision Model and Notation (DMN) modeler in the Business Modeler online viewer provides a new guided tour when you open the modeler for the first time. The DMN guided tour shows the main modeler features and workflows to help you get started. You can dismiss the guided tour prompts at any time and the prompts do not appear again.

=== Improvements to {PRODUCT} business modelers

The {PRODUCT} business modelers, including VSCode, desktop, online, and Chrome extensions, include the following notable improvements:

* Keyboard shortcut support for Linux, Windows, and Mac operating systems. To view available shortcuts, click the keyboard icon in the lower-left corner of the BPMN or DMN canvas in any {PRODUCT} business modeler.
* Support for undo, redo, and asynchronous save in all {PRODUCT} business modelers. This improvement also provides Is Dirty indicators that help you avoid losing unsaved data.
