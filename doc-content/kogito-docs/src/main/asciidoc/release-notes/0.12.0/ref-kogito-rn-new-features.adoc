=== Data Index Service support for Milestone

From this release, the Data Index Service, allows that Milestone information to be retrieved via the `ProcessInstance` object in GraphQL.
The GraphQL query below demonstrates how to retrieve all Milestone data related to a particular process instance.
```
{ProcessInstances{
  milestones {
    id
    name
    status
  }
}}
```

Apart from retrieving Milestone information, the GraphQL API from Data Index Service also allows to filter by Milestone  `id`, `name` and `status`.

Querying by process instances by milestone name:
```
{
  ProcessInstances(where: {milestones: {name: {equal: "AMilestoneName"}}}) {
    id
  }
}
```

Querying by process instances by milestone status:
```
{
  ProcessInstances(where: {milestones: {status: {in: [AVAILABLE, ACTIVE] }}}) {
    id
  }
}
```

== {PRODUCT} tooling

=== DMN included models in the {PRODUCT} DMN modeler in VSCode

The {PRODUCT} Decision Model and Notation (DMN) modeler in VSCode contains a new *Included Models* tab that you can use to include other DMN models from your project in a specified DMN file. When you include a DMN model within another DMN file, you can reuse the decision requirements diagram (DRD) nodes and logic of the included model in that DMN file. This enhancement helps you more efficiently integrate DMN logic between different DMN models in your project.

For more information about DMN included models in {PRODUCT}, see
