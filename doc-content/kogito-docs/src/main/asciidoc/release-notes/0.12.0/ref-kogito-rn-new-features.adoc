The following sections describe some of the new features or enhancements in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}.

== {PRODUCT} runtimes

=== Improved GraphQL security in the {PRODUCT} Data Index Service

When you enable security in the {PRODUCT} Data Index Service, you can now also configure the GraphQL interface endpoint and authentication requirements. The Data Index Service also now uses multi-tenant configuration to support `web-app` and `service` application types at the same time in different endpoints.

For more information about enabling security in the {PRODUCT} Data Index, see xref:proc-data-index-service-security_kogito-configuring[].

Description

== {PRODUCT} Operator and CLI

=== New `KogitoBuild` custom resource

The {PRODUCT} Operator now supports a `KogitoBuild` custom resource that you can use to build {PRODUCT} services separately before deploying them. When you use this custom resource, you can also specify the type of build, such as from binary, from Source-to-Image (S2I), or from a file (DMN, BPMN, or DRL). 

For an example configuration that uses the `KogitoBuild` custom resource to link builds with service deployments on OpenShift, see the https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-cloud-operator/blob/master/examples/process-quarkus-example-runtime-build.yaml[`process-quarkus-example-runtime-build.yaml`] example file.

== Integration with the Events API

When the {PRODUCT} Operator deploys a new resource, you can now view additional information about the created resources in the Events console without having to rely on the log of the {PRODUCT} Operator pod. This integration will be improved in a future release to provide more meaningful information about the operator controlled resources.

Description

== {PRODUCT} tooling

=== DMN included models in the {PRODUCT} DMN modeler in VSCode

The {PRODUCT} Decision Model and Notation (DMN) modeler in VSCode contains a new *Included Models* tab that you can use to include other DMN models from your project in a specified DMN file. When you include a DMN model within another DMN file, you can reuse the decision requirements diagram (DRD) nodes and logic of the included model in that DMN file. This enhancement helps you more efficiently integrate DMN logic between different DMN models in your project.
