= New features in {PRODUCT} 1.15

[role="_abstract"]
The following sections describe some of the new features or enhancements in {PRODUCT} 1.15.

== {PRODUCT} runtimes

=== {PRODUCT} runtime tools Dev UI

Added the new Runtime tools Quarkus extension to help during the development of your {PRODUCT} applications in Quarkus. The extension will add a new ui with unified features from the different Kogito consoles that will be accessible in the Quarkus Dev UI.

For more information, see {URL_PROCESS_SERVICES}#con-runtime-tools-dev-ui_kogito-developing-process-services[Runtime tools Quarkus Extension].

=== {PRODUCT} recommends upgraded version of Infinispan

Starting from {PRODUCT} 1.15.0, you must upgrade the Infinispan version to 13.0.2 or greater.

=== {PRODUCT} async execution support for process nodes

Starting from 1.15, {PRODUCT} supports setting `Is Async` property to the process nodes, which can modify the process execution behavior. The nodes that are async are executed asynchronously, signifying that process state builds up until an async node is found. When an async node is found, a separate execution thread is started to handle the process execution.

Also, you must set the {PRODUCT} Jobs Service properly, as the Jobs Service is responsible for triggering the execution of async nodes in the process instance.

=== {PRODUCT} Data Index PostgreSQL schema updates

A set of changes are applied to make the naming convention of the PostgreSQL database schema more consistent. When you upgrade to the {PRODUCT} Data Index version 1.15.0, the existing schema becomes incompatible.

You can manually recreate the new PostgreSQL schema using the provided DDL https://repository.jboss.org/org/kie/kogito/kogito-ddl/{COMMUNITY_VERSION_FINAL}/[kogito-ddl-{COMMUNITY_VERSION_FINAL}-db-scripts.zip] script, and then migrating the data to the new structure to deploy the {PRODUCT} Data Index version 1.15.0.
