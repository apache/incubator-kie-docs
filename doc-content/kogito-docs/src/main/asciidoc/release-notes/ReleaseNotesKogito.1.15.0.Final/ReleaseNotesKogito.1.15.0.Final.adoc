=== {PRODUCT} Data Index PostgreSQL schema updates

In order to make the PostgreSQL database schema to have a more consistent naming convention, a set of changes where applied.
This means that when upgrading to {PRODUCT} Data Index version 1.15.0, the existing schema will be incompatible.
We recommend manually recreating the new PostgreSQL schema using the provided DDL https://repository.jboss.org/org/kie/kogito/kogito-ddl/{COMMUNITY_VERSION_FINAL}/[kogito-ddl-{COMMUNITY_VERSION_FINAL}-db-scripts.zip] script,
and then migrating the data to the new structure in order to deploy {PRODUCT} Data Index version 1.15.0.
