=== {PRODUCT} Data Index PostgreSQL schema updates

A set of changes are applied to make the naming convention of the PostgreSQL database schema more consistent. When you upgrade to the {PRODUCT} Data Index version 1.15.0, the existing schema becomes incompatible.

You can manually recreate the new PostgreSQL schema using the provided DDL https://repository.jboss.org/org/kie/kogito/kogito-ddl/{COMMUNITY_VERSION_FINAL}/[kogito-ddl-{COMMUNITY_VERSION_FINAL}-db-scripts.zip] script, and then migrating the data to the new structure to deploy the {PRODUCT} Data Index version 1.15.0.
