=== Ability to enable consistency in process data and {PRODUCT} events using MongoDB and Debezium

You can now configure the {PRODUCT} services to update the process data and events of the same unit of work and avoid potential data inconsistencies. After configuring the {PRODUCT} services, you can use Debezium to capture the new {PRODUCT} events from MongoDB collection and stream the events to Apache Kafka topics.

For more information, see {URL_CONFIGURING_KOGITO}#proc-events-mongodb-debezium_kogito-configuring[_Enabling consistency in process data and {PRODUCT} events using MongoDB and Debezium_] and {URL_CONFIGURING_KOGITO}#proc-mongodb-persistence-enabling_kogito-configuring[_Enabling MongoDB persistence for {PRODUCT} services_].

=== Ability to create custom REST endpoints using {PRODUCT} API

{PRODUCT} now enables you to create custom REST endpoints using {PRODUCT} API. The {PRODUCT} API is only available for Quarkus and is currently experimental.

For more information about creating custom REST endpoints, see {URL_CREATING_RUNNING}#proc-kogito-custom-rest-endpoint-api_kogito-creating-running[_Creating custom REST endpoints using {PRODUCT} API_].

=== Ability to disable protobuf generation in {PRODUCT}

{PRODUCT} now allows users to disable protobuf marshaller generation for runtime persistence and fallback on Java serialization. Also, you can disable the generation of protobuf file for the Data Index service if not used.

For more information, see {URL_CONFIGURING_KOGITO}#ref-kogito-runtime-properties_kogito-configuring[_{PRODUCT} runtime properties quick reference_].
