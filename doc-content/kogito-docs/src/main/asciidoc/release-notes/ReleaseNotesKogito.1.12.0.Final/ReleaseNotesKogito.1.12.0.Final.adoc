[role="_abstract"]
The following sections describe some of the new features or enhancements in {PRODUCT} 1.12.

== {PRODUCT} runtimes

=== {PRODUCT} Data Index service new Gateway API methods

A new set of GraphQL mutations are supported to perform the following operations on different {PRODUCT} services:

* Update process instance variables
* Trigger a node instance related to a process instance
* Retrigger an existing node instance
* Cancel a node instance
* Reschedule a job
* Cancel a job
* Get user task schema
* Update user task instance
* Add a comment to user task instance
* Add an attachment to user task instance

For more information, see {URL_CONFIGURING_KOGITO}#con-data-index-service_kogito-configuring[_{PRODUCT} Data Index Service_].

=== Ability to use outbox pattern in {PRODUCT} events using MongoDB and Debezium

You can now configure the {PRODUCT} services to update the process data and events of the same unit of work entirely to avoid potential data inconsistencies. After configuring the {PRODUCT} services, you can use Debezium to capture the new {PRODUCT} events from MongoDB collections and stream the events to Apache Kafka topics.

For more information, see {URL_CONFIGURING_KOGITO}#proc-events-mongodb-debezium_kogito-configuring[_Enabling consistency in process data and {PRODUCT} events using MongoDB and Debezium_] and {URL_CONFIGURING_KOGITO}#proc-mongodb-persistence-enabling_kogito-configuring[_Enabling MongoDB persistence for {PRODUCT} services_].

=== Ability to create custom REST endpoints using {PRODUCT} API

{PRODUCT} now enables you to create custom REST endpoints using {PRODUCT} API. The {PRODUCT} API is only available for Quarkus and is currently experimental.

For more information about creating custom REST endpoints, see {URL_CREATING_RUNNING}#proc-kogito-custom-rest-endpoint-api_kogito-creating-running[_Creating custom REST endpoints using {PRODUCT} API_].

=== Ability to disable protobuf generation in {PRODUCT}

{PRODUCT} now allows users to disable protobuf marshaller generation for runtime persistence and fallback on Java serialization. Also, you can disable the generation of protobuf file for the Data Index service if not used.

For more information, see {URL_CONFIGURING_KOGITO}#ref-kogito-runtime-properties_kogito-configuring[_{PRODUCT} runtime properties quick reference_].
