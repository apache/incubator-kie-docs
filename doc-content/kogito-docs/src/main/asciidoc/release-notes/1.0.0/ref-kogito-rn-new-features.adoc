= New features in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}

The following sections describe some of the new features or enhancements in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}.

== {PRODUCT} runtimes

===  Migration to Infinispan Server 11.0 for persistence

Starting this release, the {PRODUCT} runtime and supporting services, such as the {PRODUCT} Data Index Service and Jobs Service, have been updated to use https://infinispan.org/[Infinispan Server] 11.0 for data persistence.

To start using Infinispan Server 11.0 in your {PRODUCT} services, in the `pom.xml` file of each {PRODUCT} project, update the `<kogito.version>` property to `1.0` (the current {PRODUCT} version) and build your project as usual. This regenerates the protobuf files in the `target/classes/persistence` folder, which are shared between the {PRODUCT} runtime and the Data Index Service.

If your Infinispan cache indexing is manually configured in Infinispan and you encounter an error about Infinispan sort fields (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ISPN-12203[ISPN-12203]), add the following configuration to your Infinispan cache as a workaround:

{PRODUCT} now provides a Task Console for viewing and interacting with user tasks in {PRODUCT} process services.

You can use the {PRODUCT} Task Console to view, filter, and sort assigned tasks, to view details for a selected task, or to move a selected task to the next phase of the task lifecycle.

For more information about the {PRODUCT} Task Console, see

=== Support for BPMN Compensation constructs

{PRODUCT} now supports BPMN Compensation constructs in process services. Compensation constructs provide BPMN processes with a more flexible and advanced flow control. When a process reaches an intermediate compensation or compensation end node with an activity reference defined, the process executes a compensation boundary with a task attached to that activity reference. If no activity reference has been defined, all of the compensation boundary nodes are executed instead.

Start compensation nodes in subprocesses are currently not supported.
