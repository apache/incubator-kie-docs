== {PRODUCT} runtimes

===  Migration to Infinispan Server 11.0 for persistence

Starting this release, the {PRODUCT} runtime and supporting services, such as the {PRODUCT} Data Index Service and Jobs Service, have been updated to use https://infinispan.org/[Infinispan Server] 11.0 for data persistence.

To start using Infinispan Server 11.0 in your {PRODUCT} services, in the `pom.xml` file of each {PRODUCT} project, update the `<kogito.version>` property to `1.0` (the current {PRODUCT} version) and build your project as usual. This regenerates the protobuf files in the `target/classes/persistence` folder, which are shared between the {PRODUCT} runtime and the Data Index Service.

If your Infinispan cache indexing is manually configured in Infinispan and you encounter an error about Infinispan sort fields (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ISPN-12203[ISPN-12203]), add the following configuration to your Infinispan cache as a workaround:
