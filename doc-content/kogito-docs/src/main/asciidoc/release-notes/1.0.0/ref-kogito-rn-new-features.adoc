= New features in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}

The following sections describe some of the new features or enhancements in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}.

== {PRODUCT} runtimes

===  Migration to use Infinispan 11

Starting from this release, {PRODUCT} runtimes and its supporting services such as Data Index and Job Service, have been 
updated to use https://infinispan.org/[Infinispan Server] 11.0 for data persistence.

To start using Infinispan 11, you will need to re-generated the proto files shared between {PRODUCT} runtime and Data Index.
All you need to do is to upgrade your project to {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} and recompile. That will regenerate the proto files
under the usual `target/classes/persistence` folder.

In case your Infinispan Cache Indexing is manually configured in Infinispan, you might run into the following issue [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ISPN-12203[ISPN-12203]],
you should add the following configuration to your cache:

```xml
  <indexing>
    <property name="hibernate.search.index_uninverting_allowed">true</property>
  </indexing>
```
