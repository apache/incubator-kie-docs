= New features in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}

The following sections describe some of the new features or enhancements in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}.

== {PRODUCT} runtimes

===  Migration to Infinispan Server 11.0 for persistence

Starting this release, the {PRODUCT} runtime and supporting services, such as the {PRODUCT} Data Index Service and Jobs Service, have been updated to use https://infinispan.org/[Infinispan Server] 11.0 for data persistence.

To start using Infinispan Server 11.0 in your {PRODUCT} services, in the `pom.xml` file of each {PRODUCT} project, update the `<kogito.version>` property to `1.0` (the current {PRODUCT} version) and build your project as usual. This regenerates the protobuf files in the `target/classes/persistence` folder, which are shared between the {PRODUCT} runtime and the Data Index Service.

If your Infinispan cache indexing is manually configured in Infinispan and you encounter an error about Infinispan sort fields (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ISPN-12203[ISPN-12203]), add the following configuration to your Infinispan cache as a workaround:

{PRODUCT} now provides a Task Console for viewing and interacting with user tasks in {PRODUCT} process services.

You can use the {PRODUCT} Task Console to view, filter, and sort assigned tasks, to view details for a selected task, or to move a selected task to the next phase of the task lifecycle.

For more information about the {PRODUCT} Task Console, see

=== Support for Compensations

Support for Compensation constructs have been added to {PRODUCT}. Compensations are a type of BPMN construct
that provides processes with a more flexible and advanced flow control. When a process reaches an _Intermediate Compensation_ or _Compensation End_ node with an _Activity Reference_ defined, the process will execute a _Compensation Boundary_ with a task attached to that _Activity Reference_. If no _Activity Reference_ has been defined all the _Compensation Boundary_ nodes will be executed instead.

_Start Compensation_ nodes that are used in subprocesses are not supported.
