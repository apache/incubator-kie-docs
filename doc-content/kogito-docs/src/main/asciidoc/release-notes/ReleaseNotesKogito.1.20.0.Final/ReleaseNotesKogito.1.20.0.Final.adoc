The following sections describe some of the new features or enhancements in {PRODUCT} 1.20.

== {PRODUCT} runtimes

=== Specific extension for decision table files

All the files with `.xls`, `.xlsx` and `.csv` extensions are considered and parsed as decision tables. In general, this is a too strong assumption, breaking projects containing random excel files that are not decision tables and generating artificial compile-time errors. To prevent such problems this policy has been changed, considering and processing files as decision tables only if their extension is prepended with `.drl`. In other words, files with `.drl.xls`, `.drl.xlsx`, and `.drl.csv` extensions will now be compiled as decision tables.
