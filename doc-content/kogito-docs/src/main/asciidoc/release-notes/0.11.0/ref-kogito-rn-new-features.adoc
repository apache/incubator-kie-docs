=== Test scenarios now supported by the {PRODUCT} VSCode extension

The {PRODUCT} https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-tooling/releases[VSCode extension] now supports `.scesim` (scenario simulation) files that you can use to define test scenarios in the test scenario modeler in Visual Studio Code (VSCode).

Test scenarios in {PRODUCT} enable you to validate the functionality of business decisions and business decision data during project development. With a test scenario, you use data from your project to set given conditions and expected results based on one or more defined business decisions. When you run the scenario, the expected results and actual results of the decision instance are compared. If the expected results match the actual results, the test is successful. If the expected results do not match the actual results, then the test fails.
