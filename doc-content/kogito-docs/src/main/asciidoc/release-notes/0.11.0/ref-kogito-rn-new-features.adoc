= New features in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}

The following sections describe some of the new features or enhancements in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}.

== {PRODUCT} runtimes

ifdef::KOGITO-COMM[]
=== New {PRODUCT} example applications with OptaPlanner

The following {PRODUCT} example applications with OptaPlanner integration are now available:

* https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/tree/master/process-optaplanner-quarkus[`process-optaplanner-quarkus`]: OptaPlanner example for {PRODUCT} on Quarkus
* https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/tree/master/process-optaplanner-springboot[`process-optaplanner-springboot`]: OptaPlanner example for {PRODUCT} on Spring Boot

These example applications illustrate how to use OptaPlanner to optimize planning resources in a sample airline process service.

For more information about OptaPlanner integration with {PRODUCT}, see the https://docs.optaplanner.org/latestFinal/optaplanner-docs/html_single/index.html#integrationWithQuarkus[OptaPlanner documentation].

For more information about running {PRODUCT} example applications, see xref:proc-kogito-app-examples-running_kogito-creating-running[].

== {PRODUCT} Operator and CLI

ifdef::KOGITO-COMM[]
=== Support for {PRODUCT} service deployment on Kubernetes

The {PRODUCT} Operator now supports {PRODUCT} service deployment on Kubernetes. After you create your {PRODUCT} services as part of a business application, you can build a container image for your {PRODUCT} project, push the image to an image registry, and then use the {PRODUCT} Operator to deploy your services on Kubernetes from the registered container image. The {PRODUCT} Operator uses a `KogitoRuntime` custom resource that enables Kubernetes or OpenShift deployment from a registered container image. This resource does not require you to build the images in the cluster. Instead, you can pass the {PRODUCT} service image that you want to deploy and the {PRODUCT} Operator handles the building and deployment for you.

For more information about {PRODUCT} service deployment on Kubernetes, see xref:proc-kogito-deploying-on-kubernetes_kogito-deploying-on-openshift[].

== {PRODUCT} tooling

=== {PRODUCT} VSCode extension now available in Visual Studio Marketplace

Beginning in VSCode 1.46.0, the {PRODUCT} VSCode extension is now available in Visual Studio Marketplace. {PRODUCT} provides a *{PRODUCT} Bundle* VSCode extension that enables you to design Decision Model and Notation (DMN) decision models, Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) 2.0 business processes, and test scenarios directly in VSCode. {PRODUCT} also provides individual *DMN Editor* and *BPMN Editor* VSCode extensions for DMN or BPMN support only, if needed.

To install the {PRODUCT} VSCode extension directly in VSCode, select the *Extensions* menu option in VSCode and search for and install the *{PRODUCT} Bundle* extension.

=== Test scenarios now supported by the {PRODUCT} VSCode extension

The {PRODUCT} https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-tooling/releases[VSCode extension] now supports `.scesim` (scenario simulation) files that you can use to define test scenarios in the test scenario modeler in Visual Studio Code (VSCode).

Test scenarios in {PRODUCT} enable you to validate the functionality of business decisions and business decision data during project development. With a test scenario, you use data from your project to set given conditions and expected results based on one or more defined business decisions. When you run the scenario, the expected results and actual results of the decision instance are compared. If the expected results match the actual results, the test is successful. If the expected results do not match the actual results, then the test fails.

IMPORTANT: Test scenarios in {PRODUCT} currently support DMN decision services only. Test scenarios will support Drools Rule Language (DRL) decision services in a future release.

=== Improvements to the {PRODUCT} VSCode extension

The {PRODUCT} VSCode extension has been updated to incorporate enhancements and fixes from the VSCode API 1.45.0. Enhancements and fixes include improved undo, redo, asynchronous save, save as, and backup options in VSCode.

For more details about these {PRODUCT} VSCode extension enhancements, see https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KOGITO-1863[KOGITO-1863] in Atlassian Jira.

For more information about other VSCode API enhancements, see the https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_45[April 2020 (version 1.45.0)] VSCode release notes.

=== Improvements to the {PRODUCT} BPMN modeler

The {PRODUCT} BPMN modeler includes the following notable improvements:

* Support for variable tagging in processes [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KOGITO-1020[KOGITO-1020]]
* Ability to use the file name as the process ID [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KOGITO-1354[KOGITO-1354]]
* Ability to import work item definitions from external files [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KOGITO-1426[KOGITO-1426]]
