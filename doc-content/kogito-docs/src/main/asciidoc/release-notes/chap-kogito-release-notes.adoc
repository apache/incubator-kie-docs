== New features in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}

[role="_abstract"]
The following sections describe some of the new features or enhancements in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}.

=== {PRODUCT} runtimes

==== New example applications in `kogito-examples` repository

You can now use the following example applications in the `kogito-examples` repository in Github to interact with a process using the {PRODUCT} Management and Task Console:

* https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/tree/stable/process-usertasks-quarkus-with-console[process-usertasks-quarkus-with-console]: Enables you to explore a user task process using the Management and Task Console and provides an easy way to create the required services using docker-compose including Kafka, Infinispan, Data Index, Management Console, and Task Console. Also, this example application shows the process interaction using the Management and Task console.
* https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/tree/master/process-usertasks-timer-quarkus-with-console[process-usertasks-timer-quarkus-with-console]: Enables you to explore the execution of a process containing user tasks, a job (timer), and the {PRODUCT} Job Service to the docker-compose environment. Also, this example application shows the Management and Task console interaction with the jobs.
* https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/tree/master/process-usertasks-with-security-oidc-quarkus-with-console[process-usertasks-with-security-oidc-quarkus-with-console]: Shows the interaction of the Management and Task console when security is enabled using an open ID connector such as Keycloak.

== Known issues in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}

[role="_abstract"]
The following list describes some of the known issues in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}. For more information about each known issue, select the Atlassian Jira link provided.

* In some cases on Windows, users cannot extract the downloaded {PRODUCT} Business Modeler Hub or Business Modeler desktop application ZIP files using the standard Windows unzip functionality. Users must extract the files using a file extractor, such as 7-Zip. [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KOGITO-1897[KOGITO-1897]]
* In some cases on Windows, when users extract the downloaded {PRODUCT} Business Modeler Hub or Business Modeler desktop application ZIP files to a directory location with a long path, the application can fail to open or load indefinitely. Users must extract the files to a directory location with a shorter path. [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KOGITO-1933[KOGITO-1933]]
* In the DMN boxed literal expression editor, when a user presses the *Tab* key within a FEEL expression, the FEEL auto-complete feature adds white space between characters instead of navigating out of the expression editor. [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KOGITO-1581[KOGITO-1581]]
* In some cases, the names of task nodes in a BPMN process diagram cannot be edited. [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KOGITO-1267[KOGITO-1267]]
* In a {PRODUCT} service where a DMN decision model is invoked in a BPMN process model, when a user interacts with the service through REST API requests, a `HashMap cannot be cast to __OBJECT__` error is returned in the error log. [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KOGITO-1332[KOGITO-1332]]
* In some cases, Quarkus developer mode fails to reload DRL and DMN assets. To fix the issue, you can set the `quarkus.dev.instrumentation` configuration option to false. [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KOGITO-4512[KOGITO-4512]]
