== New features in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}

[role="_abstract"]
The following sections describe some of the new features or enhancements in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}.

=== {PRODUCT} runtimes

==== PostgreSQL persistence add-on configuration
You can now configure the connection with PostgreSQL using environment variables. For example, you can use `PGUSER` and `PGPASSWORD` to specify the username and password. For more information about the full list of supported variables, see https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-pg-client/java/#_environment_variables[vertx-pg-client].

==== Infinispan upgrade to version 12.1.4
Starting from {PRODUCT} 1.8, you can upgrade to the Infinispan version 12.1.4, when using Infinispan persistence add-on for persistence. For more information about upgrading Infinispan version, see https://infinispan.org/docs/stable/titles/upgrading/upgrading.html[Infinispan upgrade guide].

==== Support for PostgreSQL runtime persistence with JDBC Driver

As an alternative to using PostgreSQL with Reactive Drivers for {PRODUCT} runtime persistence, you can enable persistence with JDBC driver for your {PRODUCT} services using https://www.postgresql.org/[PostgreSQL]. For {PRODUCT} persistence with PostgreSQL, you must have PostgreSQL installed and running to enable persistence.

With this enhancement, the following new example applications are available to demonstrate {PRODUCT} services with PostgreSQL persistence:

* https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/tree/stable/process-postgresql-persistence-quarkus[`process-postgresql-persistence-quarkus`]: Example on Quarkus
* https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/tree/stable/process-postgresql-persistence-springboot[`process-postgresql-persistence-springboot`]: Example on SpringBoot

For more information about PostgreSQL persistence in {PRODUCT}, see {URL_CONFIGURING_KOGITO}#proc-postgresql-persistence-enabling_kogito-configuring[_{CONFIGURING_KOGITO}_].

=== {PRODUCT} Operator and CLI

==== Improved/new bla bla

Description

=== {PRODUCT} supporting services

==== Support MongoDB persistence for Jobs Service

You can now configure the {PRODUCT} Jobs Service to use https://www.mongodb.com/[MongoDB] for persistence storage. You need to have MongoDB installed and running before enabling the persistence for Jobs Service.

With this enhancement, the following new artifact is available:

* https://repository.jboss.org/org/kie/kogito/jobs-service-mongodb/[`jobs-service-mongodb`]: Use this artifact to run Jobs Service with MongoDB

For more information about MongoDB persistence for {PRODUCT} Jobs Service, see {URL_CONFIGURING_KOGITO}#proc-jobs-service-persistence-mongodb_kogito-configuring[_{CONFIGURING_KOGITO}_].

==== Support PostgreSQL persistence for Data Index Service

You can now configure the {PRODUCT} Data Index to use https://www.postgresql.org/[PostgreSQL] for persistence storage as an alternative to MongoDB or Infinispan persistence. You must have PostgreSQL installed and running before enabling the persistence for Jobs Service.

For more information about PostgreSQL persistence for {PRODUCT} Data Index , see {URL_CONFIGURING_KOGITO}#proc-data-index-service-postgresql_kogito-configuring[_{CONFIGURING_KOGITO}_].

==== Index domain-specific data in Data Index Service

Starting from the {PRODUCT} 1.8, you can enable or disable the domain-specific types or custom types indexing. To achieve this, you can set the `kogito.data-index.domain-indexing` property to `true` or `false`, based on the behavior you want to achieve. By default, the domain indexing is enabled in Data Index Service using MongoDB and Infinispan persistence type.

When you disable the domain indexing, the Data Index Service stops creating the custom types in GraphQL queries, and the GraphQL schema exposes queries only for `ProcessInstances`, `UserTaskInstances` and `Jobs` types.

NOTE: The Data Index PostgreSQL persistence provider does not support indexing for custom types. Therefore, setting the `kogito.data-index.domain-indexing` property to `true` does not have any impact.

==== Data Index and Jobs service Infinispan upgrade to version 12.1.4
Starting from {PRODUCT} 1.8, when you use Data Index or Jobs Service with Infinispan persistence, then minimum required version is upgraded to Infinispan 12.1.4. For more information about upgrading Infinispan version, see https://infinispan.org/docs/stable/titles/upgrading/upgrading.html[Infinispan upgrade guide].

The following list describes some of the known issues in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}. For more information about each known issue, select the Atlassian Jira link provided.

* In some cases on Windows, users cannot extract the downloaded {PRODUCT} Business Modeler Hub or Business Modeler desktop application ZIP files using the standard Windows unzip functionality. Users must extract the files using a file extractor, such as 7-Zip. [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KOGITO-1897[KOGITO-1897]]
* In some cases on Windows, when users extract the downloaded {PRODUCT} Business Modeler Hub or Business Modeler desktop application ZIP files to a directory location with a long path, the application can fail to open or load indefinitely. Users must extract the files to a directory location with a shorter path. [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KOGITO-1933[KOGITO-1933]]
* In some cases, the names of task nodes in a BPMN process diagram cannot be edited. [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KOGITO-1267[KOGITO-1267]]
* In a {PRODUCT} service where a DMN decision model is invoked in a BPMN process model, when a user interacts with the service through REST API requests, a `HashMap cannot be cast to __OBJECT__` error is returned in the error log. [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KOGITO-1332[KOGITO-1332]]
