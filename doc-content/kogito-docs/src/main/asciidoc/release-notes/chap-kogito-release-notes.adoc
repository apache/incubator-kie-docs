[id="ref-kogito-rn-new-features_{context}"]
== New features in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}

[role="_abstract"]
The following sections describe some of the new features or enhancements in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}.

=== {PRODUCT} runtimes

====  Migration to Infinispan Server 11.0 for persistence

Starting this release, the {PRODUCT} runtime and supporting services, such as the {PRODUCT} Data Index Service and Jobs Service, have been updated to use https://infinispan.org/[Infinispan Server] 11.0 for data persistence.

To start using Infinispan Server 11.0 in your {PRODUCT} services, in the `pom.xml` file of each {PRODUCT} project, update the `<kogito.version>` property to `1.0` (the current {PRODUCT} version) and build your project as usual. This regenerates the protobuf files in the `target/classes/persistence` folder, which are shared between the {PRODUCT} runtime and the Data Index Service.

If your Infinispan cache indexing is manually configured in Infinispan and you encounter an error about Infinispan sort fields (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ISPN-12203[ISPN-12203]), add the following configuration to your Infinispan cache as a workaround:

.Configuration to avoid sort field error in manually configured Infinispan cache
[source,xml]
----
<indexing>
  <property name="hibernate.search.index_uninverting_allowed">true</property>
</indexing>
----

==== {PRODUCT} Management Console enhancements

The {PRODUCT} Management Console includes the following key enhancements:

* *New _Jobs Management_ page*: You can use this new page to view a list of available jobs, to filter jobs by status, and perform actions for individual jobs, such as view details, reschedule, or cancel. You can also select multiple jobs and perform bulk operations at the top of the page, such as canceling all selected jobs.
+
.Jobs Management page

+
.Cancel operation result
image::kogito/bpmn/kogito-management-console-jobs-management-bulk-cancel.png[Image of Jobs Management cancel operation result in Management Console]

* *New cancel operation in _Jobs_ panel*: In the *Process Details* page, the *Jobs* panel now provides a cancel operation for jobs in *Scheduled*, *Retry*, and *Error* state.
+
.Cancel a job
image::kogito/bpmn/kogito-management-console-jobs-panel-cancel.png[Image of jobs cancel option in Management Console]

* *New job operations in _Timeline_ page*: In the *Process Details* page, the *Timeline* panel now provides options to perform job-related actions for nodes related to a job. You can select the clock icon to view the job details or select the kebab menu for additional job operations, such as *Job Reschedule* or *Job Cancel*, depending on the job status.
+
.Reschedule the job for a node in error state

.View job details for an active node

For more information about the {PRODUCT} Management Console, see {URL_PROCESS_SERVICES}#con-management-console_kogito-developing-process-services[_{PROCESS_SERVICES}_].

==== New {PRODUCT} Task Console

{PRODUCT} now provides a Task Console for viewing and interacting with user tasks in {PRODUCT} process services.

.{PRODUCT} Task Console
image::kogito/bpmn/kogito-task-console.png[Image of Kogito Task Console]

You can use the {PRODUCT} Task Console to view, filter, and sort assigned tasks, to view details for a selected task, or to move a selected task to the next phase of the task lifecycle.

For more information about the {PRODUCT} Task Console, see {URL_PROCESS_SERVICES}#con-task-console_kogito-developing-process-services[_{PROCESS_SERVICES}_].

==== Support for BPMN Compensation constructs

{PRODUCT} now supports BPMN Compensation constructs in process services. Compensation constructs provide BPMN processes with a more flexible and advanced flow control. When a process reaches a compensation intermediate node or compensation end node with an activity reference defined, the process executes a compensation boundary with a task attached to that activity reference. If no activity reference has been defined, all of the compensation boundary nodes are executed instead.

Compensation start nodes in subprocesses are currently not supported.

For more information about BPMN support in {PRODUCT}, see {URL_PROCESS_SERVICES}#ref-bpmn-support_kogito-developing-process-services[_{PROCESS_SERVICES}_].

=== {PRODUCT} Operator and CLI

==== Improved/new bla bla

Description

=== {PRODUCT} supporting services

==== New operator in Data Index Service GraphQL API

The {PRODUCT} Data Index Service GraphQL API now supports a `not` operator. This operator enables you to negate any single filter available for a specific GraphQL type. For example, a `UserTaskInstances` type contains an attribute named `excludedUsers` that is an array of Strings. In this example, to create a query where a specific user is not in this list, surround the usual filter for this attribute with a `not` operator, as shown in the following example:

.Example GraphQL query using `not` operator
[source]
----
UserTaskInstances( where: {  not: { excludedUsers: { contains : $actualOwner } } }
----

For more information about querying application data with the Data Index Service, see {URL_CONFIGURING_KOGITO}#proc-data-index-service-using_kogito-configuring[Using the {PRODUCT} Data Index Service to query application data].

== Known issues in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}

[role="_abstract"]
The following list describes some of the known issues in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}. For more information about each known issue, select the Atlassian Jira link provided.

* In some cases on Windows, users cannot extract the downloaded {PRODUCT} Business Modeler Hub or Business Modeler desktop application ZIP files using the standard Windows unzip functionality. Users must extract the files using a file extractor, such as 7-Zip. [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KOGITO-1897[KOGITO-1897]]
* In some cases on Windows, when users extract the downloaded {PRODUCT} Business Modeler Hub or Business Modeler desktop application ZIP files to a directory location with a long path, the application can fail to open or load indefinitely. Users must extract the files to a directory location with a shorter path. [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KOGITO-1933[KOGITO-1933]]
* In some cases, when Infinispan is running in an OpenShift instance deployed on Amazon Web Services and a configured Data Index Service instance is restarted, the {PRODUCT} Data Index Service stops running and the PROTO files are removed. [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KOGITO-1497[KOGITO-1497]]
* In the DMN boxed literal expression editor, when a user presses the *Tab* key within a FEEL expression, the FEEL auto-complete feature adds white space between characters instead of navigating out of the expression editor. [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KOGITO-1581[KOGITO-1581]]
* In some cases, the names of task nodes in a BPMN process diagram cannot be edited. [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KOGITO-1267[KOGITO-1267]]
* In a {PRODUCT} service where a DMN decision model is invoked in a BPMN process model, when a user interacts with the service through REST API requests, a `HashMap cannot be cast to __OBJECT__` error is returned in the error log. [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KOGITO-1332[KOGITO-1332]]
* A {PRODUCT} project that uses the Jobs Service as a timer service fails to execute timer nodes when the project is built in native mode. [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KOGITO-1179[KOGITO-1179]]
