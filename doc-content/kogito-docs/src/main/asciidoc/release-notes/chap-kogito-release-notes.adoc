== Known issues in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}

[role="_abstract"]
The following list describes some of the known issues in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}. For more information about each known issue, select the Atlassian Jira link provided.

* In some cases on Windows, users cannot extract the downloaded {PRODUCT} Business Modeler Hub or Business Modeler desktop application ZIP files using the standard Windows unzip functionality. Users must extract the files using a file extractor, such as 7-Zip. [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KOGITO-1897[KOGITO-1897]]
* In some cases on Windows, when users extract the downloaded {PRODUCT} Business Modeler Hub or Business Modeler desktop application ZIP files to a directory location with a long path, the application can fail to open or load indefinitely. Users must extract the files to a directory location with a shorter path. [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KOGITO-1933[KOGITO-1933]]
* In some cases, the names of task nodes in a BPMN process diagram cannot be edited. [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KOGITO-1267[KOGITO-1267]]
* In a {PRODUCT} service where a DMN decision model is invoked in a BPMN process model, when a user interacts with the service through REST API requests, a `HashMap cannot be cast to __OBJECT__` error is returned in the error log. [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KOGITO-1332[KOGITO-1332]]
