=== {PRODUCT} domain-specific services

* Lightweight cloud-native services based on high-level business models, such as processes and decisions

[id="ref-kogito-rn-new-features_{context}"]
== New features in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}

[role="_abstract"]
The following sections describe some of the new features or enhancements in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}.

=== {PRODUCT} runtimes

==== Support for PostgreSQL runtime persistence

As an alternative to using Infinispan or MongoDB for {PRODUCT} runtime persistence, you can enable persistence for your {PRODUCT} services using https://www.postgresql.org/[PostgreSQL]. For {PRODUCT} persistence with PostgreSQL, you must have PostgreSQL installed and running to enable persistence.

With this enhancement, the following new example applications are available to demonstrate {PRODUCT} services with PostgreSQL persistence:

* https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/tree/stable/process-postgresql-persistence-quarkus[`process-postgresql-persistence-quarkus`]: Example on Quarkus
* https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/tree/stable/process-postgresql-persistence-springboot[`process-postgresql-persistence-springboot`]: Example on SpringBoot

For more information about PostgreSQL persistence in {PRODUCT}, see {URL_CONFIGURING_KOGITO}#proc-postgresql-persistence-enabling_kogito-configuring[_{CONFIGURING_KOGITO}_].

== Known issues in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}

[role="_abstract"]
The following list describes some of the known issues in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}. For more information about each known issue, select the Atlassian Jira link provided.

* In some cases on Windows, users cannot extract the downloaded {PRODUCT} Business Modeler Hub or Business Modeler desktop application ZIP files using the standard Windows unzip functionality. Users must extract the files using a file extractor, such as 7-Zip. [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KOGITO-1897[KOGITO-1897]]
* In some cases on Windows, when users extract the downloaded {PRODUCT} Business Modeler Hub or Business Modeler desktop application ZIP files to a directory location with a long path, the application can fail to open or load indefinitely. Users must extract the files to a directory location with a shorter path. [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KOGITO-1933[KOGITO-1933]]
* In some cases, the names of task nodes in a BPMN process diagram cannot be edited. [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KOGITO-1267[KOGITO-1267]]
* In a {PRODUCT} service where a DMN decision model is invoked in a BPMN process model, when a user interacts with the service through REST API requests, a `HashMap cannot be cast to __OBJECT__` error is returned in the error log. [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KOGITO-1332[KOGITO-1332]]
