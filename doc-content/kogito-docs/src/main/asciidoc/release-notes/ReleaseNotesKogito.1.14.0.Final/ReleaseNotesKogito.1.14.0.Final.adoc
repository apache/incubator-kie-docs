== {PRODUCT} runtimes

=== Quarkus Dev Service for {PRODUCT} Data Index Service

The {PRODUCT} Process Quarkus extension, can now automatically provision the Data Index Service when running the Quarkus application on Development mode. Once you start your Quarkus project on development mode, an in-memory instance of the Data Index service starts in the background.

The {PRODUCT} Process Quarkus extension sets up your Quarkus application to automatically replicate any {PRODUCT} messaging events into the provisioned Data Index instance. When the service is running, you can query the GraphQL interface directly from your application using `http://localhost:8180/graphql` or use the Quarkus Dev UI console `http://localhost:8080/q/dev/`.

For more information, see {URL_CONFIGURING_KOGITO}#con-data-index-dev-service_kogito-configuring[_Quarkus Dev Service for {PRODUCT} Data Index Service_].

=== Support for jq expressions in Serverless Workflow

{PRODUCT} now provides support for jq expressions in Serverless Workflow. By default, all workflow expressions must be defined using the https://stedolan.github.io/jq/[jq] https://github.com/stedolan/jq/releases/tag/jq-1.6[version 1.6] syntax.

If you want to use a different expression language, then ensure that the same expression language is used for all the workflow expressions.

=== Error handling updates in Serverless Workflow

The Serverless Workflow language now allows you to define `explicit` error handling. That means you can define the error handling inside your workflow model instead of defining a generic error handling entity.

Defining error handling inside your workflow model, allows error handling to become part of your orchestration activities and business problem solutions.
