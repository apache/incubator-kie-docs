= New features in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}

The following sections describe some of the new features or enhancements in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}.

== {PRODUCT} runtimes

=== New Serverless Workflow example application

{PRODUCT} provides a new https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/tree/stable/serverless-workflow-functions-quarkus[`serverless-workflow-functions-quarkus`] example application. This example contains a workflow that performs two consecutive REST invocations defined as functions. For more information about Serverless Workflow orchestration in {PRODUCT}, see

=== {PRODUCT} Management Console security enabling/disabling at runtime.

Security integration have been moved at quarkus level. The {PRODUCT} Management Console application is now using the https://quarkus.io/guides/security-openid-connect[Quarkus OpenId Connect] extension to manage security.
Now, security can be enabled/disabled at runtime as other services like {PRODUCT} Jobs or {PRODUCT} Data Index.

=== Support for multiple diagrams in DMN models

For complex DMN models, you can now use the {PRODUCT} DMN modeler to design multiple DMN decision requirements diagrams (DRDs) that represent parts of the overall decision requirements graph (DRG) for a DMN decision model. This improvement enables you to better organize DMN decision models with many decision requirements by dividing the model into smaller nested DRDs.

For example, the following DRD for a loan prequalification decision model contains all DMN components for the model without any nested DRDs. This example relies on the single DRD for all components and logic, resulting in a large and complex diagram.

Alternatively, you can divide this example DRD into multiple nested DRDs to better organize the decision requirements, as shown in the following example:
