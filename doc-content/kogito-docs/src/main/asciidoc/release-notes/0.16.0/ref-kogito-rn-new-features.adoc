=== Support for multiple diagrams in DMN models

For complex DMN models, you can now use the {PRODUCT} DMN modeler to design multiple DMN decision requirements diagrams (DRDs) that represent parts of the overall decision requirements graph (DRG) for a DMN decision model. This improvement enables you to better organize DMN decision models with many decision requirements by dividing the model into smaller nested DRDs.

For example, the following DRD for a loan prequalification decision model contains all DMN components for the model without any nested DRDs. This example relies on the single DRD for all components and logic, resulting in a large and complex diagram.

Alternatively, you can divide this example DRD into multiple nested DRDs to better organize the decision requirements, as shown in the following example:
