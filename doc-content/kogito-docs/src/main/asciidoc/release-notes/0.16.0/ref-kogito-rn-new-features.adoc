= New features in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}

The following sections describe some of the new features or enhancements in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}.

== {PRODUCT} runtimes

=== New Serverless Workflow example application

{PRODUCT} provides a new https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/tree/stable/serverless-workflow-functions-quarkus[`serverless-workflow-functions-quarkus`] example application. This example contains a workflow that performs two consecutive REST invocations defined as functions. For more information about Serverless Workflow orchestration in {PRODUCT}, see

{URL_ORCHESTRATING_SERVICES}[_{ORCHESTRATING_SERVICES}_].
endif::[]
ifdef::KOGITO-COMM[]
xref:chap-kogito-orchestrating-serverless[].
endif::[]

=== Support for enabling or disabling security at runtime in {PRODUCT} Management Console

To align with Quarkus improvements, {PRODUCT} now provides a new OpenID Connect configuration in the {PRODUCT} Management Console to enable or disable security at runtime. Before this enhancement, you could enable or disable security for the console only at build time. This enhancement also aligns the Management Console with the same runtime security support in other {PRODUCT} supporting services, such as the {PRODUCT} Data Index Service, {PRODUCT} Jobs Service, and {PRODUCT} Trusty Service.

For more information about enabling security in the {PRODUCT} Management Console, see

=== New {PRODUCT} Trusty Service and Explainability Service example applications

{PRODUCT} provides the following new example applications to illustrate {PRODUCT} Trusty Service and Explainability Service capabilities:

* https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/tree/stable/dmn-tracing-quarkus[`dmn-tracing-quarkus`]: A DMN decision service on Quarkus that uses the `tracing-decision-quarkus-addon` add-on to generate tracing events that the {PRODUCT} Trusty Service and Explainability Service can consume and expose.
* https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/tree/stable/trusty-demonstration[`trusty-demonstration`]: A tutorial for deploying the `dmn-tracing-quarkus` example application on Kubernetes as a demonstration of {PRODUCT} Trusty Service and Explainability Service capabilities in a cloud environment.

For more information about the {PRODUCT} Trusty Service and Explainability Service, see

== {PRODUCT} tooling

=== Support for multiple diagrams in DMN models

For complex DMN models, you can now use the {PRODUCT} DMN modeler to design multiple DMN decision requirements diagrams (DRDs) that represent parts of the overall decision requirements graph (DRG) for a DMN decision model. This improvement enables you to better organize DMN decision models with many decision requirements by dividing the model into smaller nested DRDs.

For example, the following DRD for a loan prequalification decision model contains all DMN components for the model without any nested DRDs. This example relies on the single DRD for all components and logic, resulting in a large and complex diagram.

Alternatively, you can divide this example DRD into multiple nested DRDs to better organize the decision requirements, as shown in the following example:

== {PRODUCT} management console

=== Added node trigger panel in process details

A new panel is added in process details page, provides a dropdown with a list of triggerable nodes. Once the user selects a node from the list of available nodes, details about the nodes are shown and the user can trigger the node using the *Trigger* button.
