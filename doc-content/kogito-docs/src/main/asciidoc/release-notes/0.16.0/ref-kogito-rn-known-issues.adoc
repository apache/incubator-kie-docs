* In some cases on Windows, users cannot extract the downloaded {PRODUCT} Business Modeler Hub or Business Modeler desktop application ZIP files using the standard Windows unzip functionality. Users must extract the files using a file extractor, such as 7-Zip. [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KOGITO-1897[KOGITO-1897]]
* In some cases on Windows, when users extract the downloaded {PRODUCT} Business Modeler Hub or Business Modeler desktop application ZIP files to a directory location with a long path, the application can fail to open or load indefinitely. Users must extract the files to a directory location with a shorter path. [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KOGITO-1933[KOGITO-1933]]
* In some cases, when Infinispan is running in an OpenShift instance deployed on Amazon Web Services and a configured Data Index Service instance is restarted, the {PRODUCT} Data Index Service stops running and the PROTO files are removed. [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KOGITO-1497[KOGITO-1497]]
* In the DMN boxed literal expression editor, when a user presses the *Tab* key within a FEEL expression, the FEEL auto-complete feature adds white space between characters instead of navigating out of the expression editor. [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KOGITO-1581[KOGITO-1581]]
* In some cases, the names of task nodes in a BPMN process diagram cannot be edited. [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KOGITO-1267[KOGITO-1267]]
* In a {PRODUCT} service where a DMN decision model is invoked in a BPMN process model, when a user interacts with the service through REST API requests, a `HashMap cannot be cast to __OBJECT__` error is returned in the error log. [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KOGITO-1332[KOGITO-1332]]
* A {PRODUCT} project that uses the Jobs Service as a timer service fails to execute timer nodes when the project is built in native mode. [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KOGITO-1179[KOGITO-1179]]
* In some cases, when users execute a DMN model that contains multiple decision requirements diagrams (DRDs), validation errors might prevent the execution. As a workaround, users must add the `kogito.decisions.validation=DISABLED` property in the `application.properties` file of the {PRODUCT} project to disable model validation and successfully execute the model. [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KOGITO-3571[KOGITO-3571]]
