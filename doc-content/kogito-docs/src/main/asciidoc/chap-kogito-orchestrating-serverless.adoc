// Purpose statement for the assembly
As a microservices developer or architect, you can use the https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/specification[Serverless Workflow specification] to orchestrate application services in your {PRODUCT} project. The Serverless Workflow specification enables you to define declarative workflow models that orchestrate event-driven, serverless applications. The specification is hosted by the https://www.cncf.io/[Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)] and is currently a CNCF https://www.cncf.io/sandbox-projects/[Sandbox project] that is progressing to become an https://www.cncf.io/projects/[Incubating project].

For more information about Serverless Workflow, see the https://serverlessworkflow.github.io/[Serverless Workflow] website.
