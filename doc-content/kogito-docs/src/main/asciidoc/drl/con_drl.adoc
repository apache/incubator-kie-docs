= Drools Rule Language (DRL)

Drools Rule Language (DRL) is a notation established by the https://www.drools.org/[Drools] open source business automation project for defining and describing business rules. You define DRL rules in `.drl` text files. A DRL file can contain one or more rules that define at a minimum the rule conditions (`when`) and actions (`then`).

DRL files consist of the following components:

.Components in a DRL file
[source,subs="attributes+"]
----
package
unit  // Recommended

import

function  // Optional

query  // Optional

declare   // Optional

global   // Optional

rule "rule name"
    // Attributes
    when
        // Conditions
    then
        // Actions
end

rule "rule2 name"

...

 The following example DRL rule determines the age limit in a loan application decision service: 

.Example rule for loan application age limit
[source]
----
rule Underage
  when
    application : /loanApplication
    /applicant[ age < 21 ]
  then
    application.setApproved( false );
    application.setExplanation( "Underage" );
end 
----

A DRL file can contain single or multiple rules and queries.
The DRL are grouped by using _units_ (see the specific section for details).
Each rule must have a unique name within the _unit_. If you use the same rule name more than once in any DRL file in the unit, the rules fail to compile. Rule names should generally follow standard  Java identifier conventions. 
It is however also possible to enclose rule names with double quotation marks (`rule "rule name"`) to  prevent possible compilation errors, especially if you use spaces in rule names.
