= Rule actions in DRL

The `then` part of the rule (also known as the _Right Hand Side (RHS)_ of the rule) contains the actions to be performed when the conditional part of the rule has been met. Actions consist of one or more _methods_ that execute consequences based on the rule conditions and on available data objects in the package. For example, if a bank requires loan applicants to have over 21 years of age (with a rule condition `Applicant( age < 21 )`) and a loan applicant is under 21 years old, the `then` action of an `"Underage"` rule would be `setApproved( false )`, declining the loan because the applicant is under age.

The main purpose of rule actions is to to insert, delete, or modify data in the working memory of the {DECISION_ENGINE}. Effective rule actions are small, declarative, and readable. If you need to use imperative or conditional code in rule actions, then divide the rule into multiple smaller and more declarative rules.

rule "Underage"

    application : LoanApplication()
    Applicant( age < 21 )
  then
    application.setApproved( false );
    application.setExplanation( "Underage" );
end
