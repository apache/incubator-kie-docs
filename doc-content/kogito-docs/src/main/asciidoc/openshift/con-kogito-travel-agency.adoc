= Travel agency tutorial for {PRODUCT} services on {OPENSHIFT}

The https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/tree/stable/kogito-travel-agency[`kogito-travel-agency`] example application in GitHub contains {PRODUCT} services related to travel booking. The purpose of this example application is to help you get started with deploying {PRODUCT} services on {OPENSHIFT}.

The example application illustrates many of the configuration options you can use whether you are deploying services locally or on {OPENSHIFT}, such as process persistence with Infinispan, messaging with Apache Kafka, and application data indexing with the {PRODUCT} Data Index Service.

For more information about this example application, see the `README` file in the application folder.

This tutorial demonstrates the following two related services in the `kogito-travel-agency` example application:

* https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/tree/stable/kogito-travel-agency/travels[`travels`]: Service for booking a trip to a specified destination, including flight and hotel
* https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/tree/stable/kogito-travel-agency/visas[`visas`]: Service for managing travel visas, if required

The following Business Model and Notation (BPMN) 2.0 process models are the core processes in these services:

.Travels core process

.Visas core process

These two services communicate with each other through events. The travel agency service schedules specified travel plans and sends visa applications for travelers that require visas to visit a specified country. The visa service then evaluates any visa applications and responds with the visa approval or rejection.

The services expose REST API endpoints that are generated from the BPMN business process definitions in the services. Internally, the services communicate using Apache Kafka messaging. The logic to interact with Kafka to produce and consume messages is also generated from the BPMN process definitions.

.Tutorial objectives
