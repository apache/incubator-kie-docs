= Deploying {PRODUCT} services on OpenShift using the OpenShift web console

After you create your {PRODUCT} services as part of a business application, you can use the {OPENSHIFT} web console to deploy your services. The {PRODUCT} Operator page in the OpenShift web console guides you through the deployment process. The {PRODUCT} Operator uses the https://github.com/operator-framework[Operator Framework] and automates many of the deployment steps for you. For example, when you give the operator a link to the Git repository that contains your application, the operator can automatically configure the components required to build your project from source and deploy the resulting services.

.Prerequisites
* The application with your {PRODUCT} services is in a Git repository that is reachable from your OpenShift environment.
* You have access to the OpenShift web console with `cluster-admin` permissions.

.Procedure
. In the OpenShift web console, go to *Operators* -> *OperatorHub* in the left menu, search for and select *Kogito*, and follow the on-screen instructions to install the latest operator version.
. After you install the {PRODUCT} Operator, in the OpenShift web console, go to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators* and select *Kogito*.
. In the operator page, select the *Kogito Service* tab and click *Create Kogito App* to create the {PRODUCT} service definition.
+

. In the application window, drag and drop a YAML or JSON file that contains your service definition, or manually define the service data in the application window.
+
--
At a minimum, define the application configurations shown in the following example YAML file:

.Example YAML definition for an application with {PRODUCT} services
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: app.kiegroup.org/v1alpha1 # {PRODUCT} API for this service
kind: KogitoApp  # Application type
metadata:
  name: example-quarkus  # Application name
  namespace: kogito  # OpenShift project namespace
spec:
  build:
    gitSource:
      uri: 'https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples'  # Git repository containing application (uses default branch)
      contextDir: process-quarkus-example  # Git folder location of application
----

[NOTE]
====
If you have configured an internal Maven repository, you can use it as a Maven mirror service and specify the Maven mirror URL in your {PRODUCT} service definition to substantially shorten build time:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  build:
    mavenMirrorURL: http://nexus3-nexus.apps-crc.testing/repository/maven-public/
----

For more information about internal Maven repositories, see the https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-repositories.html[Apache Maven] documentation.

. After you define your application data, click *Create* to generate the {PRODUCT} service.
+
--
Your application is listed in the {PRODUCT} service page:

.New {PRODUCT} service instance

You can select the application name to view or modify application settings and YAML details:

.View {PRODUCT} service details

NOTE: The application details page displays available deployments only after the application is built and deployed successfully, as shown in this example.

--
. In the left menu of the web console, go to *Builds* -> *Builds* to view the status of your application build.
+
--
You can select a specific build to view build details:

.View {PRODUCT} service build details

[NOTE]
====
For every {PRODUCT} service that you create for OpenShift deployment, two builds are generated and listed in the *Builds* page in the web console: a traditional runtime build and a Source-to-Image (S2I) build with the suffix `-builder`. The S2I mechanism builds the application in an OpenShift build and then passes the built application to the next OpenShift build to be packaged into the runtime container image. The {PRODUCT} S2I build configuration also enables you to build the project directly from a Git repository on the OpenShift platform.

--
. After the application build is complete, go to *Workloads* -> *Deployment Configs* to view the application deployment configurations, pod status, and other details.
+
--
You can select the application name to increase or decrease the pod count or modify deployment settings:

.View {PRODUCT} service deployment details

--
. After your {PRODUCT} service is deployed, in the left menu of the web console, go to *Networking* -> *Routes* to view the access link to the deployed application.
+
--
You can select the application name to view or modify route settings:

.View {PRODUCT} service route details
image::kogito/openshift/kogito-ocp-app-route-details.png[Image of Kogito service route details page in web console]

With the application route, you can integrate your {PRODUCT} services with your business automation solutions as needed.
