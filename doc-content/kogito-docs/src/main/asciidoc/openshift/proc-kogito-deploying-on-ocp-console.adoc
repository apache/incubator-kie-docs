= Deploying {PRODUCT} services on OpenShift using the OpenShift web console

After you create your {PRODUCT} services as part of a business application, you can use the {OPENSHIFT} web console to deploy your services. The {PRODUCT} Operator page in the OpenShift web console guides you through the deployment process. The {PRODUCT} Operator is based on the https://sdk.operatorframework.io/[Operator SDK] and automates many of the deployment steps for you. For example, when you give the operator a link to the Git repository that contains your application, the operator can automatically configure the components required to build your project from source and deploy the resulting services.

.Prerequisites
* The application with your {PRODUCT} services is in a Git repository that is reachable from your OpenShift environment.
* You have access to the OpenShift web console with `cluster-admin` permissions.

.Procedure
. In the OpenShift web console, go to *Operators* -> *OperatorHub* in the left menu, search for and select *Kogito*, and follow the on-screen instructions to install the latest operator version.
. After you install the {PRODUCT} Operator, in the OpenShift web console, go to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators* and select *Kogito*.
. In the operator page, select the *Kogito Build* tab and click *Create KogitoBuilds* to create the {PRODUCT} build definition.
+

. In the application window, drag and drop a YAML or JSON file that contains your build definition, or manually define the build data in the application window.
+
--
At a minimum, define the application configurations shown in the following example YAML file:

.Example YAML definition for an application with {PRODUCT} build
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: app.kiegroup.org/v1alpha1 # {PRODUCT} API for this service
kind: KogitoBuild  # Application type
metadata:
  name: example-quarkus  # Application name
  namespace: kogito  # OpenShift project namespace
spec:
  type: RemoteSource
  gitSource:
    uri: 'https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples'  # Git repository containing application (uses default branch)
    contextDir: process-quarkus-example  # Git folder location of application
----

[NOTE]
====
If you have configured an internal Maven repository, you can use it as a Maven mirror service and specify the Maven mirror URL in your {PRODUCT} build definition to substantially shorten build time:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  mavenMirrorURL: http://nexus3-nexus.apps-crc.testing/repository/maven-public/
----

For more information about internal Maven repositories, see the https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-repositories.html[Apache Maven] documentation.

[NOTE]
====
For every {PRODUCT} service that you create for OpenShift deployment, two builds are generated and listed in the *Builds* page in the web console: a traditional runtime build and a Source-to-Image (S2I) build with the suffix `-builder`. The S2I mechanism builds the application in an OpenShift build and then passes the built application to the next OpenShift build to be packaged into the runtime container image. The {PRODUCT} S2I build configuration also enables you to build the project directly from a Git repository on the OpenShift platform.

. After the application build is complete, go to *Workloads* -> *Deployments* to view the application deployments, pod status, and other details.

You can select the application name to increase or decrease the pod count or modify deployment settings:

.View {PRODUCT} service deployment details

. After your {PRODUCT} service is deployed, in the left menu of the web console, go to *Networking* -> *Routes* to view the access link to the deployed application.

--
You can select the application name to view or modify route settings:

.View {PRODUCT} service route details

With the application route, you can integrate your {PRODUCT} services with your business automation solutions as needed.
