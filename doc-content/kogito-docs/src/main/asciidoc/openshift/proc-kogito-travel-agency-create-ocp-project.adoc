= Creating an OpenShift project and installing the {PRODUCT} Operator using the {PRODUCT} CLI

To set up an example application with {PRODUCT} services for deployment on {OPENSHIFT}, you must create a project (namespace) in OpenShift in which you can install the application and the {PRODUCT} Operator. The {PRODUCT} Operator is based on the https://sdk.operatorframework.io/[Operator SDK] and automates many of the deployment steps for you. The first time that you use the {PRODUCT} CLI to interact with a project or service, the {PRODUCT} Operator is automatically installed and used to execute the relevant tasks.

You can create the project and install the {PRODUCT} Operator using the OpenShift web console or using the {PRODUCT} CLI. This example uses the {PRODUCT} CLI.

.Procedure
In a command terminal, enter the following command to create an OpenShift project for the https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/tree/stable/kogito-travel-agency/extended[`kogito-travel-agency`] extended example application using the {PRODUCT} CLI:

.Creating the OpenShift project
[source]
----
$ kogito new-project kogito-travel-agency
Project `kogito-travel-agency` created successfully
----

If you do not have `cluster-admin` permissions and another user created the `kogito-travel-agency` project for you, you can alternatively use the following command to connect the {PRODUCT} CLI tooling to the existing project:

.Connecting to an existing OpenShift project
[source]
----
$ kogito use-project kogito-travel-agency
Project set to 'kogito-travel-agency'
----

The `kogito new-project` and `kogito use-project` commands automatically install the *{PRODUCT} Operator* if it isn't installed already.

.Installing Additional components

Some {PRODUCT} services require persistence and messaging infrastructure, such the Travel Agency services. {PRODUCT} Operator uses *Infinispan Operator* and *Strimzi* provided services to create the needed infrastructure for the {PRODUCT} services to run.

These operators are available under the *Operators* -> *OperatorHub* left menu and needed to be installed before proceeding. Each of these operators also provide a way to install them manually, please refer to the https://infinispan.org/infinispan-operator/master/operator.html[Infinispan Operator] and https://strimzi.io/docs/operators/master/quickstart.html#proc-install-product-str[Strimzi] documentation for more information.

After you create the OpenShift project using the {PRODUCT} CLI and install the {PRODUCT} Operator, the operator is also listed in the OpenShift web console in *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*:
