= Creating an OpenShift project and installing the {PRODUCT} Operator using the {PRODUCT} CLI

To set up an example application with {PRODUCT} services for deployment on {OPENSHIFT}, you must create a project (namespace) in OpenShift in which you can install the application and the {PRODUCT} Operator. The {PRODUCT} Operator is based on the https://sdk.operatorframework.io/[Operator SDK] and automates many of the deployment steps for you. The first time that you use the {PRODUCT} CLI to interact with a project or service, the {PRODUCT} Operator is automatically installed and used to execute the relevant tasks.

You can create the project and install the {PRODUCT} Operator using the OpenShift web console or using the {PRODUCT} CLI. This example uses the {PRODUCT} CLI.

.Procedure
In a command terminal, enter the following command to create an OpenShift project for the https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/tree/stable/kogito-travel-agency/extended[`kogito-travel-agency`] extended example application using the {PRODUCT} CLI:

.Creating the OpenShift project
[source]
----
$ kogito new-project kogito-travel-agency
Project `kogito-travel-agency` created successfully
----

If you do not have `cluster-admin` permissions and another user created the `kogito-travel-agency` project for you, you can alternatively use the following command to connect the {PRODUCT} CLI tooling to the existing project:

.Connecting to an existing OpenShift project
[source]
----
$ kogito use-project kogito-travel-agency
Project set to 'kogito-travel-agency'
----

The `kogito new-project` and `kogito use-project` commands automatically install the *{PRODUCT} Operator* if it is not installed already.

If your {PRODUCT} project requires persistence and messaging infrastructures, you can use the left menu of the OpenShift web console to navigate to *Operators* -> *OperatorHub* and install the https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan-operator[Infinispan Operator] for persistence and the https://strimzi.io/docs/latest/[Strimzi Operator] for Apache Kafka clusters and messaging. You can also install these operators manually using the https://infinispan.org/infinispan-operator/master/operator.html[Infinispan Operator Guide] or the https://strimzi.io/docs/operators/master/quickstart.html[Strimzi Quick Start guide]. The {PRODUCT} Operator uses these operators to create the needed persistence and messaging infrastructures.

After you create the OpenShift project using the {PRODUCT} CLI and install the {PRODUCT} Operator, the operator is listed with any other installed operators in the OpenShift web console in *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*:
