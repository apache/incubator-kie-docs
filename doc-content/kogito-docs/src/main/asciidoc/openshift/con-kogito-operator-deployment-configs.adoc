= {PRODUCT} service properties configuration

When a {PRODUCT} service is deployed, a `configMap` resource is created for the `application.properties` configuration of the {PRODUCT} service.

The name of the `configMap` resource consists of the name of the {PRODUCT} service and the suffix `-properties`, as shown in the following example:

.Example `configMap` resource generated during {PRODUCT} service deployment
[source,yaml]
----
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: kogito-travel-agency-properties
data:
  application.properties : |-
    property1=value1
    property2=value2
----

The `application.properties` data of the `configMap` resource is mounted in a volume to the container of the {PRODUCT} service. Any runtime properties that you add to the `application.properties` section override the default application configuration properties of the {PRODUCT} service.

When the `application.properties` data of the `configMap` is changed, a rolling update modifies the deployment and configuration of the {PRODUCT} service.
