= Interacting with the deployed travel agency services

After you deploy the example travel agency services on OpenShift, you can interact with the application interfaces to create a new travel plan.

You can also use a REST client or curl utility to send a REST request, such as the following example request body:

.Example REST request body to add a traveler and trip

  "traveller": {
    "firstName": "Jan",
    "lastName": "Kowalski",
    "email": "jan@email.com",
    "nationality": "Polish",
    "address": {
      "street": "Polna",
      "city": "Krakow",
      "zipCode": "32-000",
      "country": "Poland"
    }
  },
  "trip": {
    "country": "US",

The travels service enables users to book a trip to a certain destination, including flight and hotel. A rule set determines whether a visa is required for the specified destination. The visa approval logic is then implemented as needed by the visas service.

For this tutorial, use the application interfaces for the travels and visas services to book a trip from one country to another and approve the required visa.

.Procedure
. In the OpenShift web console, use the left menu to navigate to *Networking* -> *Routes* and select the *Location* URL for the `travels` route to view the main page of the {PRODUCT} travel agency application:

.Travel agency application interface

--
. In the travel agency application interface, click *Plan new trip*, enter details for a trip from one country to another, and click *Book your trip* to finish.
+
--
Ensure that the *Nationality* is different from the destination country so that a visa is required.

This example uses a traveler from Poland who is traveling to the United States:

.Book a new trip

The new trip is displayed in the main page of the application interface:

.New trip listed in main page of application interface

--
. Next to the new trip, click *Tasks* to view the pending tasks for that trip.

.Tasks for the new trip

. Next to the *VisaApplication* task, click *Apply*, enter random passport details in the application window, and click *Submit application*.

.Submit visa application

. In the OpenShift web console, use the left menu to navigate to *Networking* -> *Routes* and select the *Location* URL for the `visas` route to view the main page of the {PRODUCT} visas application.
+
--
The traveler visa application is displayed in the visas service interface.

. Next to the listed visa application, click *Approval* -> *Approve* to approve the visa application.
+
.Approve visa application

. Return to the travel agency application interface, and next to the approved trip, click *Tasks* and then click *Complete* for the pending *ConfirmTravel* task to complete the trip:

Now that the application activity is complete, you can inspect the data that was created and stored by the {PRODUCT} Data Index Service that you configured for your application. In this case, you can search for data from booked trips and visa applications (`Travels` and `VisaApplications`) or for data from the underlying processes and tasks (`ProcessInstances` and `UserTaskInstances`).

. In the OpenShift web console, use the left menu to navigate to *Networking* -> *Routes* and select the *Location* URL for the `kogito-data-index` route to view the {PRODUCT} Data Index Service GraphQL interface (GraphiQL):
+
.GraphiQL interface for Data Index Service

. In the GraphiQL interface, enter any of the following GraphQL queries to retrieve stored application data:
