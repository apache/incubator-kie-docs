= {PRODUCT} Operator interaction with the {PRODUCT} Trusty Service

{PRODUCT} provides a Trusty Service that stores all {PRODUCT} tracing events related to decisions made in {PRODUCT} services. The Trusty Service uses Apache Kafka messaging to consume https://cloudevents.io/[CloudEvents] messages from {PRODUCT} services, and then processes the tracing events and stores the data in the Infinispan persistence store. 

You can use the following {PRODUCT} command-line interface (CLI) operation to install the {PRODUCT} Trusty Service for auditing purposes in {PRODUCT} services:

.Enable Trusty Service
[source,subs="attributes+,+quotes"]
----
$ {PRODUCT_INIT} install trusty -p __PROJECT_NAME__
----

To export tracing events from your {PRODUCT} project, you must additionally add the `tracing-addon` add-on as a dependency to your project. 

When you enable the Trusty Service for your {PRODUCT} project, the {PRODUCT} Operator creates a `KogitoTrusty` custom resource to handle the Trusty Service deployment for you. This resource is added to your {PRODUCT} project and in the {PRODUCT} Operator page of the *Installed Operators* listed in the OpenShift web console, if applicable.

If an Infinispan Server instance and an Apache Kafka cluster are not installed in the OpenShift namespace, the {PRODUCT} Operator automatically installs the required `KogitoInfra` customer resources for the Infinispan and Apache Kafka components. 

If the {PRODUCT} Explainability Service is enabled, then the Trusty Service also stores the explainability results for all the tracing events.
