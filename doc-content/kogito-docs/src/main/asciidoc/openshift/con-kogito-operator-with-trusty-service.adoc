= {PRODUCT} Operator interaction with the {PRODUCT} Trusty Service

{PRODUCT} provides a Trusty Service that stores all {PRODUCT} tracing events related to decisions that have been taken by {PRODUCT} services. The Trusty Service uses Apache Kafka messaging to consume https://cloudevents.io/[CloudEvents] messages from {PRODUCT} services, and then process the tracing event and stores the data in the Infinispan persistence store. The Trusty Service is at the core of the TrustyAI initiative.

You can use the following {PRODUCT} command-line interface (CLI) operation to install the {PRODUCT} Trusty Service for auditing purposes in {PRODUCT} services:

.Enable Trusty Service
[source,subs="attributes+,+quotes"]
----
$ {PRODUCT_INIT} install trusty -p __PROJECT_NAME__
----

When you enable the Trusty Service for your {PRODUCT} project, the {PRODUCT} Operator creates a `KogitoTrusty` custom resource to handle the Trusty Service deployment for you. This resource is added to your {PRODUCT} project and in the {PRODUCT} Operator page of the *Installed Operators* listed in the OpenShift web console, if applicable.

If an Infinispan Server instance and an Apache Kafka cluster are not installed in the OpenShift namespace, the {PRODUCT} Operator automatically installs the required `KogitoInfra` customer resources for the Infinispan and Apache Kafka components.

If a {PRODUCT} Explainability service is provided, then the Trusty service will also store the explainability results for all the tracing events.
