= {PRODUCT} Operator interaction with the {PRODUCT} Jobs Service

{PRODUCT} provides a Jobs Service for scheduling Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) process events that are configured to be executed at a specified time. These time-based events in a process model are known as _jobs_.

By default, {PRODUCT} services use an in-memory timer service to handle jobs defined in your BPMN process models. This default timer service does not cover long time intervals and is only suitable for short delays defined in the process. For advanced use cases where time intervals can be days or weeks or when additional event handling options are required, you can configure your {PRODUCT} project to use the {PRODUCT} Jobs Service as an external timer service.

You can use the following {PRODUCT} command-line interface (CLI) operation to install the {PRODUCT} Jobs Service for job scheduling in {PRODUCT} services:

.Enable Jobs Service
[source,subs="attributes+,+quotes"]
----
$ {PRODUCT_INIT} install jobs-service -p __PROJECT_NAME__
----

When you enable the Jobs Service for your {PRODUCT} project, the {PRODUCT} Operator creates a `KogitoSupportingService` custom resource with service type as `JobsService` to handle the Jobs Service deployment for you. This resource is added to your {PRODUCT} project and in the {PRODUCT} Operator page of the *Installed Operators* listed in the OpenShift web console, if applicable.

== Infinispan persistence with the {PRODUCT} Jobs Service

To enable Infinispan persistence for the {PRODUCT} Jobs Service, you install the Infinispan infrastructure and then you can use the `--infra __INFINISPAN_INFRA_NAME__` flag during deployment in the {PRODUCT} CLI or edit the `spec.infra` configuration in the `KogitoSupportingService` custom resource with service type `JobsService`:

.Example Jobs Service deployment with Infinispan persistence enabled
[source,subs="attributes+,+quotes"]
----
$ {PRODUCT_INIT} install infra __INFINISPAN_INFRA_NAME__ --kind Infinispan --apiVersion infinispan.org/v1 -p __PROJECT_NAME__
$ {PRODUCT_INIT} install jobs-service --infra __INFINISPAN_INFRA_NAME__
----

.Example `KogitoJobsService` resource with Infinispan persistence enabled
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: app.kiegroup.org/v1alpha1
kind: KogitoSupportingService
metadata:
  name: jobs-service
spec:
  serviceType: JobsService
  infra:
    - kogito-infinispan-infra
  build:
    envs:
    - name: MAVEN_ARGS_APPEND
      value: -Ppersistence
----

You can refine the Infinispan integration by setting the `spec.infra` property in the `KogitoSupportingService` custom resource. With this property set, the {PRODUCT} Operator ensures that the Jobs Service has access to the persistence infrastructure configurations.

== {PRODUCT} Jobs Service properties configuration

When the {PRODUCT} Jobs Service is deployed, a `configMap` resource is created for the `application.properties` configuration of the Jobs Service.

The name of the `configMap` resource consists of the name of the Jobs Service and the suffix `-properties`, as shown in the following example:

.Example `configMap` resource generated during {PRODUCT} Jobs Service deployment
[source,yaml]
----
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: jobs-service-properties
data:
  application.properties : |-
    property1=value1
    property2=value2
----

The `application.properties` data of the `configMap` resource is mounted in a volume to the container of the Jobs Service. Any runtime properties that you add to the `application.properties` section override the default application configuration properties of the Jobs Service.

When the `application.properties` data of the `configMap` is changed, a rolling update modifies the deployment and configuration of the Jobs Service.
