= {PRODUCT} Operator architecture

The {PRODUCT} Operator is written in https://golang.org/[Go] and is built with the https://sdk.operatorframework.io/[Operator SDK]. The {PRODUCT} Operator uses the https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/[Kubernetes API] for most of the deployment tasks that the operator facilitates and for other internal operations.

The {PRODUCT} Operator uses the following custom resources to deploy {PRODUCT} domain-specific services (the services that you develop), {PRODUCT} supporting services, and middleware infrastructure components:

* `KogitoBuild`: Defines the build configurations for {PRODUCT} domain-specific services deployed on OpenShift
ifdef::KOGITO-COMM[]
* `KogitoRuntime`: Defines the deployment configurations for {PRODUCT} domain-specific services deployed on Kubernetes or OpenShift from a container image in an image registry
endif::[]
* `KogitoDataIndex`, `KogitoJobsService`, and `KogitoMgmtConsole`: Define the deployment configurations for the {PRODUCT} Data Index Service, Jobs Service, and Management Console
* `KogitoInfra`: Defines the relevant middleware infrastructure component or third-party operator for the {PRODUCT} service, such as Infinispan for persistence or Apache Kafka for messaging

== {PRODUCT} Operator dependencies on third-party operators

The {PRODUCT} Operator uses the following third-party operators to deploy {PRODUCT} service infrastructure components:

* *https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan-operator[Infinispan Operator]*: Used to deploy Infinispan Server instances for process data persistence in {PRODUCT} services
* *https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator[Strimzi Operator]*: Used to deploy Apache Kafka clusters with Zookeeper for messaging in {PRODUCT} services
* *https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-operator[Keycloak Operator]*: Used to deploy Keycloak server instances for security and single sign-on capabilities in {PRODUCT} services

When you enable an infrastructure mechanism during {PRODUCT} service deployment or in the corresponding custom resource, such as in the `KogitoRuntime` resource, the {PRODUCT} Operator uses the relevant third-party operator to create the infrastructure.

For example, the following `KogitoRuntime` custom resource uses the `spec.infinispan` and `spec.kafka` configurations to enable Infinispan persistence and Kafka messaging for the {PRODUCT} service:

.Example {PRODUCT} service resource with persistence and messaging enabled
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: app.kiegroup.org/v1alpha1
kind: KogitoRuntime
metadata:
  name: kogito-travel-agency
spec:
  image: <domain>/<namespace>/kogito-travel-agency:latest
  infinispan:
    useKogitoInfra: true
  kafka:
    useKogitoInfra: true
----

In this example, the {PRODUCT} Operator uses the Infinispan Operator to deploy the Infinispan Server instance for persistence and uses the Strimzi Operator to deploy the Kafka cluster for event messaging.

When you install the {PRODUCT} Operator, these third-party operators are also installed automatically by the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) and defined in the {PRODUCT} Operator `ClusterServiceVersion` (CSV) manifest file:

.Example CSV manifest file for the {PRODUCT} Operator
[source,yaml]
----
required:
    - description: Represents an Infinispan cluster
      displayName: Infinispan Cluster
      kind: Infinispan
      name: infinispans.infinispan.org
      version: v1
    - description: Represents a Kafka cluster
      displayName: Kafka
      kind: Kafka
      name: kafkas.kafka.strimzi.io
      version: v1beta1
    - description: Represents a topic inside a Kafka cluster
      displayName: Kafka Topic
      kind: KafkaTopic
      name: kafkatopics.kafka.strimzi.io
      version: v1beta1
    - description: Represents a Keycloak server to provide SSO
      displayName: Keycloak
      kind: Keycloak
      name: keycloaks.keycloak.org
      version: v1alpha1
----

If the required third-party operators are not available to the {PRODUCT} Operator during {PRODUCT} service runtime, then the {PRODUCT} Operator cannot generate the infrastructure components and a user must install the infrastructure components manually.

The {PRODUCT} Data Index Service similarly depends on Infinispan and Kafka infrastructure components. Without Infinispan persistence and Kafka messaging, the Data Index Service cannot function properly. However, you can specify whether the Data Index Service uses the general infrastructure components that the {PRODUCT} Operator generates or a custom alternative for that component.

For example, by default, the `KogitoDataIndex` resource specifies the `useKogitoInfra` configuration for both Infinispan and Kafka in order to use the corresponding infrastructure components generated by the {PRODUCT} Operator:

.Default `KogitoDataIndex` resource configuration with persistence and messaging
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: app.kiegroup.org/v1alpha1
kind: KogitoDataIndex
metadata:
  name: data-index
spec:
  replicas: 1
  kafka:
    useKogitoInfra: true
  infinispan:
    useKogitoInfra: true
----

In this case, the Data Index Service is deployed after the {PRODUCT} Operator deploys the infrastructure components to support Infinispan and Kafka for the service.

To use a custom infrastructure configuration instead of the default {PRODUCT} Operator infrastructures, you can modify the resource definition as needed.

For example, the following `KogitoDataIndex` resource uses custom configurations for an Infinispan infrastructure:

.Modified `KogitoDataIndex` resource with custom Infinispan configurations
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: app.kiegroup.org/v1alpha1
kind: KogitoDataIndex
metadata:
  name: data-index
spec:
  replicas: 1
  kafka:
    useKogitoInfra: true
  infinispan:
    useAuth: true
    credentials:
      secretName: infinispan-credentials
      usernameKey: admin
      passwordKey: 1ei59dj3!
    uri: my-infinispan-server:11222
    saslMechanism: DIGEST-MD5
    useKogitoInfra: false
----

In this case, the {PRODUCT} Operator does not deploy an Infinispan Server instance, but connects to the `my-infinispan-server` server with the specified credentials.

== {PRODUCT} Operator core package structure
