= Installing the Kafka messaging infrastructure for {PRODUCT} services on OpenShift

{PRODUCT} supports the https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-reactive-messaging[MicroProfile Reactive Messaging] specification for messaging in your services. {PRODUCT} messaging is based on https://kafka.apache.org/[Apache Kafka] and enables you to configure messages as either input or output of business process execution.

The {PRODUCT} Operator uses the https://strimzi.io/[Strimzi Operator] to deploy and manage the Kafka infrastructure in a {PRODUCT} project. For optimal {PRODUCT} deployment on OpenShift, install the Strimzi Operator and enable Kafka messaging for your {PRODUCT} services. You can install the Kafka infrastructure using the {PRODUCT} Operator page in the OpenShift web console or using the {PRODUCT} CLI.

This example uses the {PRODUCT} CLI to install the Kafka infrastructure and the {PRODUCT} Operator page in the web console to verify that the infrastructure is enabled.

.Prerequisites
* The https://strimzi.io/[Strimzi Operator] is installed in the same OpenShift namespace as your {PRODUCT} project. You can install the Strimzi Operator using the *Operators* -> *OperatorHub* page in the OpenShift web console or manually as described in the https://strimzi.io/docs/operators/master/quickstart.html[Strimzi Quick Start guide].

.Procedure
. In a command terminal, enter the following command to install the Kafka infrastructure for the {PRODUCT} services:
