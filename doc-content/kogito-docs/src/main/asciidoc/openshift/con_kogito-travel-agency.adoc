= Travel agency tutorial for {PRODUCT} services on {OPENSHIFT}

The {PRODUCT} https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-travel-agency-tutorial[travel agency tutorial] in GitHub contains a sequence of example applications with {PRODUCT} services related to travel booking. The purpose of these example applications is to help you get started with deploying {PRODUCT} services on {OPENSHIFT}.

Each travel agency or visas example application increases in complexity in numerical order, where `01` denotes the most basic example. The example applications illustrate many of the configuration options you can use whether you are deploying services locally or on {OPENSHIFT}, such as process persistence with Infinispan, messaging with Apache Kafka, and application data indexing with the {PRODUCT} Data Index Service.

For more information about each example application, see the `README` file in the relevant application folder.

This tutorial demonstrates the following two related applications:

* https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-travel-agency-tutorial/tree/master/08-kogito-travel-agency[`08-kogito-travel-agency`]: Application for booking a trip to a specified destination, including flight and hotel
* https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-travel-agency-tutorial/tree/master/08-kogito-visas[`08-kogito-visas`]: Application for managing travel visas, if required

The following Business Model and Notation (BPMN) 2.0 process models are the core processes in these applications:

.Travel agency core process

.Visas core process

These two applications communicate through events. The travel agency service schedules specified travel plans and sends visa applications for travelers that require visas to visit a given country. The visa service then evaluates any visa applications and responds with the visa approval or rejection.

The applications expose REST API endpoints that are generated from the BPMN business process definitions in the services. Internally, the applications communicate using Apache Kafka messaging. The logic to interact with Kafka to produce and consume messages is also generated from the BPMN process definitions.

.Tutorial objectives
