= {PRODUCT} Operator interaction with Prometheus

{PRODUCT} provides a `monitoring-prometheus-addon` add-on that enables Prometheus metrics monitoring for {PRODUCT} services. The {PRODUCT} Operator uses the  https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator[Prometheus Operator] to expose the metrics from your {PRODUCT} project for Prometheus to scrape. Due to this dependency, the Prometheus Operator must be installed in the same namespace as your {PRODUCT} project.

When you deploy a {PRODUCT} service that uses the `monitoring-prometheus-addon` add-on and the  Prometheus Operator is installed, the {PRODUCT} Operator creates a `ServiceMonitor` custom resource to expose the metrics for Prometheus, as shown in the following example:

.Example `ServiceMonitor` resource for Prometheus
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
  labels:
    app: onboarding-service
  name: onboarding-service
  namespace: kogito
spec:
  endpoints:
  - path: /metrics
    targetPort: 8080
    scheme: http
  namespaceSelector:
    matchNames:
    - kogito
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: onboarding-service
----

You must manually configure your `Prometheus` custom resource that is managed by the Prometheus Operator to select the `ServiceMonitor` resource:

.Example `Prometheus` resource
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: Prometheus
metadata:
  name: prometheus
spec:
  serviceAccountName: prometheus
  serviceMonitorSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: onboarding-service
----

After you configure your Prometheus resource with the `ServiceMonitor` resource, you can see the endpoint being scraped by Prometheus in the *Targets* page in the Prometheus web console:

The metrics exposed by the {PRODUCT} service appear in the *Graph* view:
