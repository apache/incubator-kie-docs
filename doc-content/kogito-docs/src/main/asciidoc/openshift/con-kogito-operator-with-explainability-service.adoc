= {PRODUCT} Operator interaction with the {PRODUCT} Explainability Service

As an aid to the {PRODUCT} Trusty Service workflow for storing tracing events, {PRODUCT} provides a supplemental Explainability Service that provides an explaination for the decisions made in {PRODUCT} services. The Explainability Service uses Apache Kafka messaging to consume https://cloudevents.io/[CloudEvents] messages from the Trusty Service, and then applies explainability algorithms. Some algorithms require the Explainability Service to interact with the {PRODUCT} service that evaluated the decision. This communication is performed with HTTP `POST` requests.

You can use the following {PRODUCT} command-line interface (CLI) operation to install the {PRODUCT} Explainability Service for auditing purposes in {PRODUCT} services:

.Enable Explainability Service
[source,subs="attributes+,+quotes"]
----
$ {PRODUCT_INIT} install explainability --infra __KAFKA_INFRA_NAME__ -p __PROJECT_NAME__
----

When you enable the Explainability Service for your {PRODUCT} project, the {PRODUCT} Operator creates a `KogitoExplainability` custom resource to handle the Explainability Service deployment for you. This resource is added to your {PRODUCT} project and in the {PRODUCT} Operator page of the *Installed Operators* listed in the OpenShift web console, if applicable.

If an Apache Kafka cluster is not installed in the OpenShift namespace, you must configure this infrastructure component before installing the Explainability Service:

.Enable Kafka messaging
[source,subs="attributes+,+quotes"]
----
$ {PRODUCT_INIT} install infra __KAFKA_INFRA_NAME__ --kind Kafka --apiVersion kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1 -p __PROJECT_NAME__
----
