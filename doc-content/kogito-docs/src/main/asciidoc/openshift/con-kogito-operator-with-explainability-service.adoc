= {PRODUCT} Operator interaction with the {PRODUCT} Explainability Service

As an aid to the {PRODUCT} Trusty Service workflow for storing tracing events, {PRODUCT} provides a supplemental Explainability Service that provides an explaination for the decisions made in {PRODUCT} services. The Explainability Service uses Apache Kafka messaging to consume https://cloudevents.io/[CloudEvents] messages from the Trusty Service, and then applies explainability algorithms. Some algorithms require the Explainability Service to interact with the {PRODUCT} service that evaluated the decision. This communication is performed with HTTP `POST` requests.

You can use the following {PRODUCT} command-line interface (CLI) operation to install the {PRODUCT} Explainability Service for auditing purposes in {PRODUCT} services:

.Enable Explainability Service
[source,subs="attributes+,+quotes"]
----
$ {PRODUCT_INIT} install explainability -p __PROJECT_NAME__
----

When you enable the Explainability Service for your {PRODUCT} project, the {PRODUCT} Operator creates a `KogitoExplainability` custom resource to handle the Explainability Service deployment for you. This resource is added to your {PRODUCT} project and in the {PRODUCT} Operator page of the *Installed Operators* listed in the OpenShift web console, if applicable.

If an Apache Kafka cluster is not installed in the OpenShift namespace, the {PRODUCT} Operator automatically installs the required `KogitoInfra` custom resources for the Apache Kafka component.
