= Installing the {PRODUCT} Operator in the OpenShift web console

As an alternative or a supplement to the {PRODUCT} command-line interface (CLI), you can use the {PRODUCT} Operator page in the {OPENSHIFT} web console to define {PRODUCT} infrastructure components and deploy {PRODUCT} services.

.Prerequisites
* The application with your {PRODUCT} services is in a Git repository that is reachable from your OpenShift environment.
* You have access to the OpenShift web console with `cluster-admin` permissions.

.Procedure
. In the OpenShift web console, go to *Operators* -> *OperatorHub* in the left menu, search for and select *Kogito*, and follow the on-screen instructions to install the latest operator version.

If the {PRODUCT} Operator is not available in the *OperatorHub* in the OpenShift web console, in a command terminal, enter the following command to add the operator to the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) and try again to install the operator in the OpenShift web console:

$ oc create -f deploy/olm-catalog/kogito-operator/kogito-operator-operatorsource.yaml

. After you install the {PRODUCT} Operator, in the OpenShift web console, go to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators* and select *Kogito* to begin defining your {PRODUCT} service components.

Use the upper toolbar options in the {PRODUCT} Operator page as needed to configure *Kogito Infra* components, such as Infinispan persistence, to configure {PRODUCT} supporting services, such as the *{PRODUCT} Data Index* and *{PRODUCT} Jobs Service*, and to create a *{PRODUCT} Service* instance.
