= Serverless Workflow orchestration

https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/specification/blob/master/specification.md[Serverless Workflow] is a specification for defining declarative workflow models that orchestrate event-driven, serverless applications. The main benefit of a Serverless Workflow strategy is that it provides a clear separation of business logic and orchestration logic in your serverless applications. Developers can focus on solving business logic inside functions and use workflows to define function invocations, specify event behavior, and provide data management for different microservices.

The https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/specification[Serverless Workflow specification] defines a vendor-neutral, platform-independent, and declarative workflow model that you can use across multiple cloud or container platforms. This portability enables you to move your workflow definitions from one cloud or container platform to another with the same execution results.

The specification is hosted by the https://www.cncf.io/[Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)] and is currently a CNCF https://www.cncf.io/sandbox-projects/[Sandbox project] that is progressing to become an https://www.cncf.io/projects/[Incubating project]. The specification has been created by CNCF community members and individuals from different companies and is a fully open source project (Apache 2.0 license).

The target users of Serverless Workflow orchestration are mostly developers and architects who want to define logical steps of execution declaratively (no code) for cloud-native services. Although you can orchestrate your services using process diagrams in https://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0/About-BPMN[Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN)], the Serverless Workflow has less focus on business definition and more focus on function-level steps of execution. Serverless Workflow is also designed specifically for microservice orchestration and therefore has a smaller scope than BPMN. Serverless Workflow also enables you to write workflows in formats (JSON or YAML) that might be better suited for developing and deploying serverless applications in cloud or container environments.

Ultimately, the choice of which specification to use for orchestrating event-driven microservices depends on your environment needs, development goals, and personal preference.

== Serverless Workflow architecture

The https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/specification[Serverless Workflow specification] provides a https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/specification/blob/master/schema/workflow.json[JSON schema] that defines the structure of JSON or YAML workflow definitions. The specification also provides a set of SDKs for https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/sdk-java[Java] and https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/sdk-go[Go] that can help developers get started with the specification to create workflows. The specification provides a set of https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/specification/blob/master/extensions/README.md[workflow extensions], such as key performance indicators (KPIs), that you can use to enhance workflow definitions with additional information. This information can then be used during execution of the workflows to provide additional data, such as metrics for improving workflow performance.

The following diagram illustrates a general Serverless Workflow architecture:

Serverless Workflow focuses on orchestration of event-driven microservices. Although the specification provides a generic markup that you can use for general workflow or pipeline (CI/CD) definitions, its declarative nature is designed for microservice orchestration.

Similar to other specification-based standards for business automation, Serverless Workflow provides a unified core definition for workflows. For example, the following diagram illustrates a single Serverless Workflow definition that is executed on multiple runtime services. Each of these services can then be deployed onto various cloud or container platforms with the same execution results.
