= Serverless Workflow use cases

Use cases for the https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/specification[Serverless Workflow specification] vary widely and depend on the reference implementations and the ecosystem available during workflow execution, such as available functions, services, and events.

The following scenarios illustrate example use cases for Serverless Workflow orchestration with microservices. For more Serverless Workflow use cases, see the https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/specification/tree/master/usecases[Serverless Workflow specification].

Payment processing::
+
--
Servlerless Workflow is ideal for coordinating session-based applications, such as e-commerce sites. You can
use Serverless Workflow to coordinate all steps of the checkout process, and even enable users to take a photo of their credit card instead of having to type in the numbers and information.

Online vehicle auction::
+
--
You can use Serverless Workflow to coordinate all steps of an online vehicle auction, such as the following aspects of the orchestration:

* Authentication of users making bids
* Communication with bidding and inventory services
* Decisions to start and end the auction under certain conditions

Data analysis::
+
--
You can use Serverless Workflow to coordinate data analysis, such as for marketing and sales information. Analysis can be scheduled on a timely basis to trigger workflow coordination of different extract, transform, load (ETL) services.

Error notifications::
+
--
You can design Serverless Workflow definitions that trigger notifications about the success or failure of the workflow orchestration. In conjunction with available messaging services, you can notify developers on different platforms of any failures, including error information and the exact point in the execution where the failure occurred. You can also log the workflow execution status to cloud storage services for further analysis.

Continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD)::
+
--
Serverless Workflow can help you build efficient continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) solutions. Code check-ins can trigger website builds and automatic redeploys. Pull requests can trigger automated tests that ensure the code is well-tested before human reviews.
