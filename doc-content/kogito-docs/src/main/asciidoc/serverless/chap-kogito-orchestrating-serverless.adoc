// Purpose statement for the assembly
[role="_abstract"]
As a microservices developer or architect, you can use the {SERVERLESS_WORKFLOW_REPO_URL_VERSION}[Serverless Workflow specification] to orchestrate application services in your {PRODUCT} project. The Serverless Workflow specification enables you to define declarative workflow models that orchestrate event-driven, serverless applications. The specification is hosted by the https://www.cncf.io/[Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)] and is currently a CNCF https://www.cncf.io/sandbox-projects/[Sandbox project] that is progressing to become an https://www.cncf.io/projects/[Incubating project].

The target users of Serverless Workflow orchestration are mostly developers and architects who want to define logical steps of execution declaratively (no code) for cloud-native services. Although you can orchestrate your services using process diagrams in https://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0/About-BPMN[Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN)], the Serverless Workflow has less focus on business definition and more focus on function-level steps of execution. Serverless Workflow is also designed specifically for microservice orchestration and therefore has a smaller scope than BPMN. Serverless Workflow also enables you to write workflows in formats (JSON or YAML) that might be better suited for developing and deploying serverless applications in cloud or container environments.

 ⚠️ Quarkus is the only supported runtime for Serverless Workflow.
 
Ultimately, the choice of which specification to use for orchestrating event-driven microservices depends on your environment needs, development goals, and personal preference.

The Serverless Workflow `functions`, `events`, and `states` are the core constructs for defining the orchestration behavior for your services. You can use one or all of these three constructs in your workflow definitions.

* `functions`: Function definitions are reusable constructs that you can use to define invocation information about services that need to be invoked during workflow execution.
* `events`: Event definitions are reusable constructs that you can use to define all consumed and produced events during workflow execution.
* `states`: State definitions enable you to define your workflow states (control-logic blocks) and determine what your workflow should do.

For more information about what you can automate using Serverless Workflow, see {SERVERLESS_WORKFLOW_REPO_URL_BASE}/tree/{SERVERLESS_WORKFLOW_VERSION_IN_REPO_URL}/usecases[use cases].

For more information about Serverless Workflow, see the https://serverlessworkflow.github.io/[Serverless Workflow] website.

NOTE: {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} implements version {SERVERLESS_WORKFLOW_REPO_URL_VERSION}/specification.md[{SERVERLESS_WORKFLOW_VERSION}] of the Serverless Workflow specification.
You can find the current implementation status https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-runtimes/tree/{PRODUCT_VERSION}.x/kogito-serverless-workflow#current-status[here].

== Serverless Workflow orchestration in {PRODUCT}

You can use Serverless Workflow definition files in your {PRODUCT} project to define your domain-specific orchestration services. Your Serverless Workflow files can be in JSON or YAML format with the extension `.sw.json` or `.sw.yaml`.

The following diagram illustrates Serverless Workflow orchestration in {PRODUCT}:

.Serverless Workflow orchestration in {PRODUCT}
image::kogito/serverless/serverless-workflow-kogito.png[Image of Serverless Workflow orchestration in Kogito]

== Serverless Workflow example in {PRODUCT}

The following example is a real-world Serverless Workflow scenario in {PRODUCT} that demonstrates how you can use Serverless Workflow definitions to orchestrate your {PRODUCT} services. In this scenario, an order service uses Serverless Workflow to process orders from multiple sources and approve or deny orders.

NOTE: For more {PRODUCT} examples that use Serverless Workflow, see the https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples[`kogito-examples`] repository in GitHub.

The following diagram illustrates the basic architecture of this scenario:

.Example Serverless Workflow orchestration for processing orders in {PRODUCT}
image::kogito/serverless/serverless-workflow-kogito-orders.png[Image of example Serverless Workflow orchestration for processing orders in Kogito]

New orders can come from different sources, such as web applications or messaging services. Each order is then converted into https://cloudevents.io/[CloudEvents] messages, which represent the events that need to trigger the workflow execution. The events are pushed to an Apache Kafka topic.

New order events that are pushed to Kafka trigger new instances of the workflow. The workflow invokes a business rule service and a human task service to make the order approval decision. The business rule service can be a {PRODUCT} service with Decision Model and Notation (DMN) decision models or Drools Rule Language (DRL) rules, or it can be an external service. For this example, the rule service uses a DRL rules in {PRODUCT} to verify whether the order can be auto-approved. If the order cannot be auto-approved, then the workflow uses the human task service, which likewise can be a {PRODUCT} service or an external service, to notify a manager that the order requires human approval.

After the order decision is made, the workflow generates an event in CloudEvents format that notifies other services or other workflows that a decision was made for a particular order.

To orchestrate these services in this way, the example uses the following `ordersworkflow.sw.json` Serverless Workflow definition:

The following diagram illustrates the basic structure and sequence of this example workflow definition:

.Structure of the example `ordersworkflow.sw.json` workflow definition
image::kogito/serverless/serverless-workflow-kogito-orders-structure.png[Image of `ordersworkflow.sw.json` workflow definition]

The `HandleNewOrder` state is the workflow starting state. This state is an `event` type state that requires one or more events to be consumed before the workflow can be invoked. This event state defines the instances of this workflow that are created when the referenced `NewOrderEvent` is consumed. In this case, events are consumed using Kafka.

After the `NewOrderEvent` is consumed, the state defines a list of `actions` to be performed. Actions define all the functions or services that must be invoked as part of the workflow. In this case, a single `AutoApproveOrderFunction` function or service defines how to invoke the rule service.

After the execution of the rule service is complete, the event state specifies that the workflow must transition to the `CheckIfNeedManagerApprvoal` state, which is a `switch` type state. The order is then either auto-approved if no manager approval is required, or is assigned to a manager to complete the remaining states of the workflow.

=== Creating and editing Serverless Workflow definitions in {PRODUCT}

[role="_abstract"]
You can use {SERVERLESS_WORKFLOW_REPO_URL_VERSION}/specification.md[Serverless Workflow] definition files in your {PRODUCT} project to define your domain-specific orchestration services. Your Serverless Workflow definition files can be in JSON or YAML format with the extension `.sw.json` or `.sw.yaml`.

.Prerequisites
* You have created a {PRODUCT} project and have included any Java objects or other business assets required for your Serverless Workflow service. For information about creating a project, see {URL_CREATING_RUNNING}#chap-kogito-creating-running[_{CREATING_RUNNING}_].

.Procedure
. In your {PRODUCT} project, create or import a `.sw.json` or `.sw.yaml` Serverless Workflow definition file in the relevant folder, typically in `src/main/resources`.
+
{PRODUCT} supports both JSON and YAML formats for workflow definitions. You can use multiple workflow definitions in both formats if needed.
. Open the workflow definition file and define the following basic components:

The Serverless Workflow `functions`, `events`, and `states` are the core constructs for defining the orchestration behavior for your services. You can use one or all of these three constructs in your workflow definitions.

NOTE: You can find more information about the core constructs in the {SERVERLESS_WORKFLOW_REPO_URL_BASE}/blob/{SERVERLESS_WORKFLOW_VERSION_IN_REPO_URL}/specification.md#workflow-model[Workflow Model] section of the specification.

For example, the following Serverless Workflow definition performs a customer credit check in a loan application service to approve or deny the customer loan application:

. Continue adding and defining any remaining components for your workflow definition files and save the completed files.

After you define your serverless workflow definitions, you can build and deploy your {PRODUCT} services as usual to your preferred cloud or container platform, such as {OPENSHIFT}. When an event trigger occurs, your application orchestrates your {PRODUCT} services according to the workflow definition or definitions that you have defined. If you are using a serverless deployment platform, such as OpenShift Serverless, your application automatically scales up based on incoming demand, or scales to zero after use.

== Error handling in Serverless Workflow

You can handle the exceptions that are thrown by `operation` nodes as described in the {SERVERLESS_WORKFLOW_REPO_URL_BASE}/blob/{SERVERLESS_WORKFLOW_VERSION_IN_REPO_URL}/specification.md#Workflow-Error-Handling[Serverless Workflow Specification].

NOTE: You need to specify the qualified name of the exception that might be thrown by the `operation` in the `code` field of the error definition.

https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/tree/stable/kogito-quarkus-examples/serverless-workflow-error-quarkus[serverless-workflow-error-quarkus] is an example application that invokes an `EvenService`, which is throwing `IllegalArgumentException` if the number in the workflow model is odd.
