= {PRODUCT} glossary of terms

This glossary defines terms, concepts, or components that are referenced frequently in {PRODUCT} documentation or that have a unique meaning or function in {PRODUCT}.

BPMN model::
A definition of a business process workflow based on the https://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0/About-BPMN[Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) specification]. BPMN is a standard established by the Object Management Group (OMG) for describing and modeling business processes. BPMN defines an XML schema that enables BPMN models to be shared between BPMN-compliant platforms and across organizations so that business analysts and business process developers can collaborate in designing and implementing BPMN process services. The BPMN standard is similar to and can be used together with the Decision Model and Notation (DMN) standard for designing and modeling business decisions.

A module for rules and a unit of execution. A rule unit collects a set of rules with the declaration of the type of facts that the rules act on. A rule unit also serves as a unique namespace for each group of rules. A single rule base can contain multiple rule units. You typically store all the rules for a unit in the same file as the unit declaration so that the unit is self-contained.

//@comment: Excluding for now due to current build issues with the extension and we aren't using it at this point. (Stetson, 2 Apr 2020)
{PRODUCT} Quarkus extension::
An extension required to generate and build a Maven project for {PRODUCT} runtime services on the Quarkus Java framework. You can add the {PRODUCT} extension during project creation using the Quarkus Maven plugin or using the https://code.quarkus.io/[Code with Quarkus] extension manager.

{PRODUCT} Data Index Service::
A dedicated service in {PRODUCT} that stores all {PRODUCT} events related to processes, tasks, and domain data. The Data Index Service uses Apache Kafka messaging to consume CloudEvents messages from {PRODUCT} services, and then indexes the returned data for future GraphQL queries and stores the data in the Infinispan persistence store. The Data Index Service is at the core of all {PRODUCT} search, insight, and management capabilities.

{PRODUCT} domain-specific service::
A business automation service for your business domain that you create using {PRODUCT}. You define the logic of this service using BPMN process models, DMN decision models, or other business models, and any other supported runtime configurations. In {PRODUCT} documentation, the general term for _{PRODUCT} services_ that you create refers to this type of service.

{PRODUCT} Jobs Service::
A dedicated service in {PRODUCT} for scheduling BPMN process events that are configured to be executed at a specified time. These time-based events in a process model are known as _jobs_. The Jobs Service does not execute a job, but triggers a callback that might be an HTTP request on a given endpoint specified for the job request or any other configured callback. The Jobs Service receives requests for job scheduling and then sends a request at the time specified on the job request.

unit of work::
A component in {PRODUCT} that serves as the basis for {PRODUCT} runtime execution. Units of work capture all steps in a process and are used internally to move a process instance from one state to the next state. After all possible steps in a process are successfully executed, the final state is sent to the {PRODUCT} runtime as a runtime event. {PRODUCT} can then use these events to notify third parties about changes to the BPMN process instance and its data.
