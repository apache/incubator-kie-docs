= Running a {PRODUCT} service

After you design the business decisions and processes for your {PRODUCT} service, you can run your Quarkus or Spring Boot application in one of the following modes:

* *Development mode*: For local testing. On Quarkus, development mode also offers live reload of your processes and decisions in your running applications for advanced debugging.
* *JVM mode*: For compatibility with a Java virtual machine (JVM).
ifdef::KOGITO-COMM[]
* *Native mode*: (Quarkus only, requires GraalVM) For direct binary execution as native code.
endif::[]
