= Enabling the {PRODUCT} VSCode extension for BPMN and DMN modeling

Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is the preferred integrated development environment (IDE) for developing {PRODUCT} services. {PRODUCT} provides a https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-tooling/releases[VSCode extension] that enables you to design Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) 2.0 business processes and Decision Model and Notation (DMN) decision models directly in VSCode.

.Prerequisites
* https://code.visualstudio.com/[VSCode] IDE is installed.

.Procedure
. In the https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-tooling/releases[kogito-tooling] page in GitHub, download the latest version of the `vscode_extension_{PRODUCT_INIT}_kie_editors___VERSION__.vsix` file.
. In your VSCode IDE, go to *Extensions* -> *More actions* -> *Install from VSIX* and select the downloaded extension file.
. When the {PRODUCT} extension appears in the extension list in VSCode, select it and click *Enable*, if needed.

After you enable this extension, any `.bpmn2` and `.dmn` files that you open in VSCode are automatically displayed as graphical models.

If the {PRODUCT} BPMN or DMN designers open only the XML source of a BPMN or DMN file and displays an error message, review the reported errors and the model file to ensure all BPMN or DMN elements are correctly defined.

//@comment: Retaining for when we add the extension to mareketplace and provide additional extension options. (Stetson, 10 Mar 2020)
The following extensions can help you design your Kogito services using graphical editors directly in your existing development environment. This list is updated as Kogito provides additional extensions and editor support.

VSCode: (Recommended) Use the Kogito VSCode extension for BPMN 2.0 and DMN modeling support. To install the extension, download the latest version of the vscode_extension_kogito_kie_editors_VERSION.vsix file from the kogito-tooling page in GitHub, and in your VSCode IDE, go to Extensions → More actions → Install from VSIX and select the downloaded extension file. When the extension appears in the extension list in VSCode, select it and click Enable, if needed.
