= Enabling the {PRODUCT} VSCode extension without the {PRODUCT} Business Modeler Hub

Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is the preferred integrated development environment (IDE) for developing {PRODUCT} services. {PRODUCT} provides a https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-tooling/releases[VSCode extension] that enables you to design Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) 2.0 business processes and Decision Model and Notation (DMN) decision models directly in VSCode.

For convenience, you can install and launch the VSCode from the https://kiegroup.github.io/kogito-online/#/download[Business Modeler Hub] desktop application, along with all other available {PRODUCT} modelers.

However, if you need to enable the VSCode extension without the {PRODUCT} Business Modeler Hub, follow this procedure to download and install the VSCode extension manually.

.Prerequisites
* https://code.visualstudio.com/[VSCode] 1.44.0 or later is installed.

.Procedure
. In the https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-tooling/releases[`kogito-tooling`] releases page in GitHub, download the latest version of the `vscode_extension_{PRODUCT_INIT}_kie_editors___VERSION__.vsix` file.
. In your VSCode IDE, go to *Extensions* -> *More actions* -> *Install from VSIX* and select the downloaded extension file.
. When the {PRODUCT} extension appears in the extension list in VSCode, select it and click *Enable*, if needed.
. Close your instance of VSCode and re-launch VSCode from a command terminal with the following command and parameters:
+
--
.On Linux or Windows
[source]
----
$ code --enable-proposed-api kiegroup.vscode-extension-pack-kogito-kie-editors
----
.On Mac
[source]
----
$ code --args --enable-proposed-api kiegroup.vscode-extension-pack-kogito-kie-editors
----

Use this method to open VSCode each time you develop {PRODUCT} services. This set of parameters enables the Microsoft https://code.visualstudio.com/api/advanced-topics/using-proposed-api[Proposed API] and is required to enable {PRODUCT} modelers in VSCode for DMN, BPMN, and test scenario files.
--

After you enable this VSCode extension, any `.bpmn2` and `.dmn` files that you open in VSCode are automatically displayed as graphical models. Additionally, any `.scesim` files that you open are automatically displayed as tabular test scenario models for testing the functionality of your business decisions.

If the {PRODUCT} BPMN or DMN modelers open only the XML source of a BPMN or DMN file and displays an error message, review the reported errors and the model file to ensure that all BPMN or DMN elements are correctly defined.

NOTE: For new BPMN or DMN models, you can also enter `bpmn.new` or `dmn.new` in a web browser to design your BPMN or DMN model in the {PRODUCT} online modeler. When you finish creating your model, you can click *Download* in the online modeler page to import your BPMN or DMN file into your {PRODUCT} project in VSCode.
