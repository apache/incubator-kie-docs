= Installing the {PRODUCT} VSCode extension bundle without the {PRODUCT} Business Modeler Hub

Although you can install and launch the {PRODUCT} Visual Studio Code (VSCode) extension from the https://kiegroup.github.io/kogito-online/#/download[Business Modeler Hub] desktop application, along with all other available {PRODUCT} modelers, you can also install {PRODUCT} VSCode extensions from Visual Studio Marketplace directly in VSCode.

VSCode is the preferred integrated development environment (IDE) for developing {PRODUCT} services. {PRODUCT} provides a *{PRODUCT} Bundle* VSCode extension that enables you to design Decision Model and Notation (DMN) decision models, Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) 2.0 business processes, and test scenarios directly in VSCode. {PRODUCT} also provides individual *DMN Editor* and *BPMN Editor* VSCode extensions for DMN or BPMN support only, if needed.

.Prerequisites
* https://code.visualstudio.com/[VSCode] 1.46.0 or later is installed.

.Procedure
. In your VSCode IDE, go to *Extensions* and search for *{PRODUCT} Bundle* for DMN, BPMN, and test scenario file support.
+
For DMN or BPMN file support only, you can also search for the individual *DMN Editor* or *BPMN Editor* extensions.
. When the {PRODUCT} extension appears in the extension list in VSCode, select it and click *Install*.
. For optimal VSCode editor behavior, after the extension installation is complete, reload or close and re-launch your instance of VSCode.

After you install the VSCode extension bundle, any `.dmn` or `.bpmn2` files that you open in VSCode are automatically displayed as graphical models. Additionally, any `.scesim` files that you open are automatically displayed as tabular test scenario models for testing the functionality of your business decisions.

If the {PRODUCT} DMN, BPMN, or test scenario modelers open only the XML source of a DMN, BPMN, or test scenario file and displays an error message, review the reported errors and the model file to ensure that all elements are correctly defined.

NOTE: For new DMN or BPMN models, you can also enter `dmn.new` or `bpmn.new` in a web browser to design your DMN or BPMN model in the {PRODUCT} online modeler. When you finish creating your model, you can click *Download* in the online modeler page to import your DMN or BPMN file into your {PRODUCT} project in VSCode.
