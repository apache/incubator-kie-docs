= Guided Rule Editor

To solve an optimization problem, define score constraints that evaluate your solution.
Planner integrates with the Guided Rule Editor and provides score modifiers which are used by the engine during the solving process.

Score modifiers can be accessed in the action selector (+) of the *THEN* (right-hand side) section of a rule, provided the Planning Solution is defined within the project.

[NOTE]
====
Make sure to define a https://docs.jboss.org/optaplanner/release/latest/optaplanner-docs/html_single/index.html#solutionClass[Planning Solution] before proceeding to a rule creation.
====

There are two types of Planner actions in the Guided Rule Editor:

* *Modify a single score level* - use the action to modify only one score component (e.g. hard score)
* *Modify multiple score levels* - use the action to modify multiple score components at the same time (e.g. hard and soft score)

Once the action is selected, Planner score input appears on the *THEN* (right-hand side) section of the rule.
Insert the value of a constraint into the text input.
Click *Validate* to verify the correctness of the inserted value.
