[[_drools.dsleditor]]
= DSL editor


The DSL editor allows DSL Sentences to be authored.
The reader should take time to explore DSL features in the Drools Expert documentation; as the syntax in Drools Workbench's DSL Editor is identical.
The normal syntax is extended to provide "hints" to control how the DSL variable is rendered and validated within the user-interface.

The following "hints" are supported:-

* {<varName>:<regular expression>}
+ 
This will render a text field in place of the DSL variable when the DSL Sentence is used in the guided editor.
The content of the text field will be validated against the regular expression.
* {<varName>:ENUM:<factType.fieldName>}
+ 
This will render an enumeration in place of the DSL variable when the DSL Sentence is used in the guided editor.
<factType.fieldName> binds the enumeration to the model Fact and Field enumeration definition.
This could be either a "Drools Workbench enumeration" (i.e.
defined within the Workbench) or a Java enumeration (i.e.
defined in a model POJO JAR file).
* {<varName>:DATE:<dateFormat>}
+ 
This will render a Date selector in place of the DSL variable when the DSL Sentence is used in the guided editor.
* {<varName>:BOOLEAN:<[checked | unchecked]>}
+ 
This will render a dropdown selector in place of the DSL variable, providing boolean choices, when the DSL Sentence is used in the guided editor.
* {<varName>:CF:<factType.fieldName>}
+ 
This will render a button that will allow you to set the value of this variable using a Custom Form.
In order to use this feature, a  Working-Set containing a Custom Form Configuration for factType.fieldName must be active.
If there is no such Working-Set, a simple text box is used (just like a regular variable).
+ 
For more information, please read more about Working-Sets and Custom Form Configurations.
