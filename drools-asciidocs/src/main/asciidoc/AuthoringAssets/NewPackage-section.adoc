= Creating a package

Configuring packages is generally something that is done once, and by someone with some experience with rules/models.
Generally speaking, very few people will need to configure packages, and once they are setup, they can be copied over and over if needed.
Package configuration is most definitely a technical task that requires the appropriate expertise.

All assets live in "packages" in Drools Workbench - a package is like a folder (it also serves as a "namespace"). A home folder for rule assets to live in.
Rules in particular need to know what the fact model is, what the namespace is etc.

So while rules (and assets in general) can appear in any number of categories, they only live in one package.
If you think of Drools Workbench as a file system, then each package is a folder, and the assets live in that folder - as one big happy list of files.

To create an empty package select "Package" from the "New item" menu.

== Empty package


An empty package can be created by simply specifying a name.

Once the Package has been created it will appear in the Project Explorer.

== Copy, Rename and Delete Packages


As already mentioned on <<_wb.projectexplorercopyrenamedeleteactions,Project Explorer>> section, users can copy, rename or delete a package directly from Project Explorer.

As you can see in the following screenshots, those operations behaves very similar to counter part actions in most workbench editors.
