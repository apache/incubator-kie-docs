[[_drools.guidedruletemplateeditor]]
= Templates of assets/rules


The guided rule editor is great when you need to define a single rule, however if you need to define multiple rules following the same structure but with different values in field constraints or action sections a "Rule Template" is a valuable asset.
Rule templates allow the user to define a rule structure with place-holders for values that are to be interpolated from a table of data.
Literal values, formulae and expressions can also continue to be used.

Rule Templates can often be used as an alternative for Decision Tables in Drools Workbench.

[[_drools.guidedruletemplateeditorcreating]]
== Creating a rule template


To create a template for a rule simply select the "Guided Rule Template" from the "New Item" menu.

[[_drools.guidedruletemplateeditordefining]]
== Define the template


Once a rule template has been created the editor is displayed.
The editor takes the form of the standard guided editor explained in more detail under the "Rule Authoring" section.
As the rule is constructed you are given the ability to insert "Template Keys" as place-holders within your field constraints and action sections.
Literal values, formulae and expressions can continue to be used as in the standard guided editor.

The following screenshot illustrates a simple rule that has been defined with a "Template Key" for the applicants' maximum age, minimum age and credit rating.
The template keys have been defined as "$max_age", "$min_age" and "$cr" respectively.

[[_drools.guidedruletemplateeditordefiningdata]]
== Defining the template data


When you have completed the definition of your rule template you need to enter the data that will be used to interpolate the "Template Key" place-holders.
Drools Workbench provides the facility to enter data in a flexible grid within the guided editor screen.
The data entry section is located on the Data tab within the editor.

The rule template data grid is very flexible; with different pop-up editors for the underlying fields' data-types.
Columns can be resized and sorted; and cells can be merged and grouped to facilitate rapid data entry.

One row of data interpolates the "Template Key" place-holders for a single rule; thus one row becomes one rule.

[NOTE]
====
If any cells for a row are left blank a rule for the applicable row is not generated.

[[_drools.guidedruletemplateeditorcellmerging]]
=== Cell merging


The icon in the top left of the grid toggles cell merging on and off.
When cells are merged those in the same column with identical values are merged into a single cell.
This simplifies changing the value of multiple cells that shared the same original value.
When cells are merged they also gain an icon in the top-left of the cell that allows rows spanning the merged cell to be grouped.

[[_drools.guidedruletemplateeditorcellgrouping]]
=== Cell grouping


Cells that have been merged can be further collapsed into a single row.
Clicking the [+\-] icon in the top left of a merged cell collapses the corresponding rows into a single entry.
Cells in other columns spanning the collapsed rows that have identical values are shown unchanged.
Cells in other columns spanning the collapsed rows that have different values are highlighted and the first value displayed.

When the value of a grouped cell is altered all cells that have been collapsed also have their values updated.

[[_drools.guidedruletemplateeditorgenerateddrl]]
== Generated DRL


Whilst not necessary, rule authors can view the DRL that will be generated for a "Rule Template" and associated data.
This feature and its operation is no different to that for other assets.
Select the "Source" tab from the bottom of the editor screen.
The DRL for all rules will be displayed.
