Name: Pet Store 
Main class: org.drools.examples.petstore.PetStoreExample
Module: drools-examples
Type: Java application
Rules file: PetStore.drl
Objective: Demonstrate use of Agenda Groups, Global Variables and integration with a GUI,
including callbacks from within the rules
----


The Pet Store example shows how to integrate Rules with a GUI, in this case a Swing based desktop application.
Within the rules file, it demonstrates how to use Agenda groups and auto-focus to control which of a set of rules is allowed to fire at any given time.
It also illustrates the mixing of the Java and MVEL dialects within the rules, the use of accumulate functions and the way of calling Java functions from within the ruleset.

All of the Java code is contained in one file, [path]_PetStore.java_
, defining the following principal classes (in addition to several classes to handle Swing Events):

* `Petstore` contains the `main()` method that we will look at shortly.
* `PetStoreUI` is responsible for creating and displaying the Swing based GUI. It contains several smaller classes, mainly for responding to various GUI events such as mouse button clicks.
* `TableModel` holds the table data. Think of it as a JavaBean that extends the Swing class ``AbstractTableModel``.
* `CheckoutCallback` allows the GUI to interact with the Rules.
* `Ordershow` keeps the items that we wish to buy.
* `Purchase` stores details of the order and the products we are buying.
* `Product` is a JavaBean holding details of the product available for purchase, and its price.


Much of the Java code is either plain JavaBeans or Swing-based.
Only a few Swing-related points will be discussed in this section, but a good tutorial about Swing components can be found at Sun's Swing website, in http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/.

The pieces of Java code in [path]_Petstore.java_
 that relate to rules and facts are shown below.

.Creating the PetStore KieContainer in PetStore.main
====
[source,java]
----
// KieServices is the factory for all KIE services 
KieServices ks = KieServices.Factory.get();

// From the kie services, a container is created from the classpath
KieContainer kc = ks.getKieClasspathContainer();

// Create the stock.
Vector<Product> stock = new Vector<Product>();
stock.add( new Product( "Gold Fish", 5 ) );
stock.add( new Product( "Fish Tank", 25 ) );
stock.add( new Product( "Fish Food", 2 ) );

// A callback is responsible for populating the
// Working Memory and for firing all rules.
PetStoreUI ui = new PetStoreUI( stock,
                                new CheckoutCallback( kc ) );
ui.createAndShowGUI();
----
====


The code shown above create a `KieContainer` from the classpath and based on the definitions in the [path]_kmodule.xml_
 file.
Unlike other examples where the facts are asserted and fired straight away, this example defers this step to later.
The way it does this is via the second last line where a `PetStoreUI` object is created using a constructor accepting the `Vector` object `stock` collecting our products, and an instance of the `CheckoutCallback` class containing the Rule Base that we have just loaded.

The Java code that fires the rules is within the  `CheckoutCallBack.checkout()` method.
This is triggered (eventually) when the Checkout button is pressed by the user.

.Firing the Rules - extract from CheckoutCallBack.checkout()
====
[source,java]
----
public String checkout(JFrame frame, List<Product> items) {
    Order order = new Order();

    // Iterate through list and add to cart
    for ( Product p: items ) {
        order.addItem( new Purchase( order, p ) );
    }

    // Add the JFrame to the ApplicationData to allow for user interaction

    // From the container, a session is created based on  
    // its definition and configuration in the META-INF/kmodule.xml file 
    KieSession ksession = kcontainer.newKieSession("PetStoreKS");

    ksession.setGlobal( "frame", frame );
    ksession.setGlobal( "textArea", this.output );

    ksession.insert( new Product( "Gold Fish", 5 ) );
    ksession.insert( new Product( "Fish Tank", 25 ) );
    ksession.insert( new Product( "Fish Food", 2 ) );

    ksession.insert( new Product( "Fish Food Sample", 0 ) );

    ksession.insert( order );
    ksession.fireAllRules();

    // Return the state of the cart
    return order.toString();
}
----
====


Two items get passed into this method.
One is the handle to the `JFrame` Swing component surrounding the output text frame, at the bottom of the GUI.
The second is a list of order items; this comes from the `TableModel` storing the information from the "Table" area at the top right section of the GUI.

The for loop transforms the list of order items coming from the GUI into the `Order` JavaBean, also contained in the file [path]_PetStore.java_
.
Note that it would be  possible to refer to the Swing dataset directly within the rules, but it is better coding practice to do it this way, using simple Java objects.
It means that we are not tied to Swing if we wanted to transform the sample into a Web application.

It is important to note that _all state in this
      example is stored in the Swing components, and that the rules are
      effectively stateless._ Each time the "Checkout" button is pressed, this code copies the contents of the Swing `TableModel` into the Session's Working Memory.

Within this code, there are nine calls to the ``KieSession``.
The first of these creates a new `KieSession` from the ``KieContainer``.
Remember that we passed in this `KieContainer` when we created the `CheckoutCallBack` class in the `main()` method.
The next two calls pass in two objects that we will hold as global variables in the rules: the Swing text area and the Swing frame used for writing messages.

More inserts put information on products into the ``KieSession``, as well as the order list.
The final call is the standard ``fireAllRules()``.
Next, we look at what this method causes to happen within the rules file.

The first part of file [path]_PetStore.drl_
 contains the standard package and import statements to make various Java classes available to the rules.
New to us are the two globals `frame` and ``textArea``.
They hold references to the Swing components `JFrame` and `JTextArea` components that were previously passed on by the Java code calling the `setGlobal()` method.
Unlike  variables in rules, which expire as soon as the rule has fired, global variables retain their value for the lifetime of the Session.

The next extract from the file [path]_PetStore.drl_
 contains two functions that are referenced by the rules that we will look at shortly.

.Java Functions in the Rules: extract from PetStore.drl

function void doCheckout(JFrame frame, KieRuntime krt) {
        Object[] options = {"Yes",
                            "No"};
                            
        int n = JOptionPane.showOptionDialog(frame,
                                             "Would you like to checkout?",
                                             "",

                                             options[0]);

       if (n == 0) {

       }   
}

function boolean requireTank(JFrame frame, KieRuntime krt, Order order, Product fishTank, int total) {
        Object[] options = {"Yes",
                            "No"};

                                             "Purchase Suggestion",
                                             JOptionPane.YES_NO_OPTION,

             krt.insert( purchase );
             order.addItem( purchase );
             System.out.println( "Yes" );
       } else {
            System.out.println( "No" );
       }      
       return true;
}

Having these functions in the rules file just makes the Pet Store example more compact.
In real life you probably have the functions in a file of their own, within the same rules package, or as a static method on a standard Java class, and import them, using ``import function my.package.Foo.hello``.

The purpose of these two functions is:

* `doCheckout()` displays a dialog asking users whether they wish to checkout. If they do, focus is set to the `checkout` agenda-group, allowing rules in that group to (potentially) fire.
* `requireTank()` displays a dialog asking users whether they wish to buy a tank. If so, a new fish tank `Product` is added to the order list in Working Memory.


We'll see the rules that call these functions later on.
The next set of examples are from the Pet Store rules themselves.
The first extract is the one that happens to fire first, partly because it has the `auto-focus` attribute set to true.

.Putting items into working memory: extract from PetStore.drl
====
[source]
----
// Insert each item in the shopping cart into the Working Memory 
// Insert each item in the shopping cart into the Working Memory
rule "Explode Cart"
    agenda-group "init"
    auto-focus true
    salience 10
    dialect "java"
when
    $order : Order( grossTotal == -1 )
    $item : Purchase() from $order.items
then
    insert( $item );
    kcontext.getKnowledgeRuntime().getAgenda().getAgendaGroup( "show items" ).setFocus();
    kcontext.getKnowledgeRuntime().getAgenda().getAgendaGroup( "evaluate" ).setFocus();
end
----
====


This rule matches against all orders that do not yet have their `grossTotal` calculated . It loops for each purchase item in that order.
Some parts of the "Explode Cart" rule should be familiar: the rule name, the salience (suggesting the order for the rules being fired) and the dialect set to ``"java"``.
There are three new features:

* `agenda-group```"init"`` defines the name of the agenda group. In this case, there is only one rule in the group. However, neither the Java code nor a rule consequence sets the focus to this group, and therefore it relies on the next attribute for its chance to fire.
* `auto-focus```true`` ensures that this rule, while being the only rule in the agenda group, gets a chance to fire when `fireAllRules()` is called from the Java code.
* `kcontext....setFocus()` sets the focus to the `"show items"` and `"evaluate"` agenda groups in turn, permitting their rules to fire. In practice, we loop through all items on the order, inserting them into memory, then firing the other rules after each insert.


The next two listings show the rules within the `"show items"` and `evaluate` agenda groups.
We look at them in the order that they are called.

.Show Items in the GUI - extract from PetStore.drl
====
[source]
----
rule "Show Items"
    agenda-group "show items"
    dialect "mvel"
when
    $order : Order( )
    $p : Purchase( order == $order )
then
   textArea.append( $p.product + "\n");
end
----
====


The `"show items"` agenda-group has only one rule, called "Show Items" (note the difference in case). For each purchase on the order currently in the Working Memory (or Session), it logs details to the text area at the bottom of the GUI.
The `textArea` variable used to do this is one of the global variables we looked at earlier.

The `evaluate` Agenda group also gains focus from the `"Explode Cart"` rule listed previously.
This Agenda group has two rules, `"Free Fish Food Sample"` and ``"Suggest Tank"``, shown below.

.Evaluate Agenda Group: extract from PetStore.drl
====
[source]
----
// Free Fish Food sample when we buy a Gold Fish if we haven't already bought 
// Fish Food and don't already have a Fish Food Sample
rule "Free Fish Food Sample"
    agenda-group "evaluate"
    dialect "mvel"
when
    $order : Order()
    not ( $p : Product( name == "Fish Food") &amp;&amp; Purchase( product == $p ) )
    not ( $p : Product( name == "Fish Food Sample") &amp;&amp; Purchase( product == $p ) )
    exists ( $p : Product( name == "Gold Fish") &amp;&amp; Purchase( product == $p ) )
    $fishFoodSample : Product( name == "Fish Food Sample" );
then
    System.out.println( "Adding free Fish Food Sample to cart" );
    purchase = new Purchase($order, $fishFoodSample);
    insert( purchase );
    $order.addItem( purchase ); 
end

// Suggest a tank if we have bought more than 5 gold fish and don't already have one
rule "Suggest Tank"
    agenda-group "evaluate"
    dialect "java"
when
    $order : Order()
    not ( $p : Product( name == "Fish Tank") &amp;&amp; Purchase( product == $p ) )
    ArrayList( $total : size &gt; 5 ) from collect( Purchase( product.name == "Gold Fish" ) )
    $fishTank : Product( name == "Fish Tank" )
then
    requireTank(frame, kcontext.getKieRuntime(), $order, $fishTank, $total); 
end
----
====


The rule `"Free Fish Food Sample"` will only fire if

* we __don't __already have any fish food, _and_
* we _don't_ already have a free fish food sample, _and_
* we _do_ have a Gold Fish in our order.


If the rule does fire, it creates a new product (Fish Food Sample), and adds it to the order in Working Memory.

The rule `"Suggest Tank"` will only fire if

* we __don't __already have a Fish Tank in our order, _and_
* we _do_ have more than 5 Gold Fish Products in our order.


If the rule does fire, it calls the `requireTank()` function that we looked at earlier (showing a Dialog to the user, and adding a Tank to the order / working memory if confirmed). When calling the __requireTank__() function the rule passes the global _frame_ variable so that the function has a handle to the Swing GUI.

The next rule we look at is ``"do checkout"``.

.Doing the Checkout - extract (6) from PetStore.drl
====
[source]
----
rule "do checkout"
    dialect "java"
    when
    then
        doCheckout(frame, kcontext.getKieRuntime());
end
----
====


The rule `"do checkout"` has **no
      agenda group set and no auto-focus attribute**.
As such, is is deemed part of the default (MAIN) agenda group.
This group gets focus by default when all the rules in agenda-groups that explicitly had focus set to them have run their course.

There is no LHS to the rule, so the RHS will always call the `doCheckout()` function.
When calling the `doCheckout()` function, the rule passes the global `frame` variable to give the function a handle to the Swing GUI.
As we saw earlier, the `doCheckout()` function shows a confirmation dialog to the user.
If confirmed, the function sets the focus to the _checkout_ agenda-group, allowing the next lot of rules to fire.

.Checkout Rules: extract from PetStore.drl
====
[source]
----
rule "Gross Total"
    agenda-group "checkout"
    dialect "mvel"
when
   $order : Order( grossTotal == -1)
   Number( total : doubleValue )
       from accumulate( Purchase( $price : product.price ), sum( $price ) )
then
    modify( $order ) { grossTotal = total };
    textArea.append( "\ngross total=" + total + "\n" );
end

rule "Apply 5% Discount"
    agenda-group "checkout"
dialect "mvel"
when
   $order : Order( grossTotal &gt;= 10 &amp;&amp; &lt; 20 )
then
   $order.discountedTotal = $order.grossTotal * 0.95;
   textArea.append( "discountedTotal total=" + $order.discountedTotal + "\n" );
end


rule "Apply 10% Discount"
    agenda-group "checkout"
    dialect "mvel"
when
   $order : Order( grossTotal &gt;= 20 )
then
   $order.discountedTotal = $order.grossTotal * 0.90;
   textArea.append( "discountedTotal total=" + $order.discountedTotal + "\n" );
end
----
====


There are three rules in the _checkout_ agenda-group:

* If we haven't already calculated the gross total, `Gross Total` accumulates the product prices into a total, puts this total into the session, and displays it via the Swing ``JTextArea``, using the `textArea` global variable yet again.
* If our gross total is between 10 and 20, `"Apply 5% Discount"` calculates the discounted total and adds it to the session and displays it in the text area.
* If our gross total is not less than 20, `"Apply 10% Discount"` calculates the discounted total and adds it to the session and displays it in the text area.


Now that we've run through what happens in the code, let's have a look at what happens when we actually run the code.
The file [path]_PetStore.java_
 contains a `main()` method, so that it can be run as a standard Java application, either from the command line or via the IDE.
This assumes you have your classpath set correctly.
(See the start of the examples section for more information.)

The first screen that we see is the Pet Store Demo.
It has a list of available products (top left), an empty list of selected products (top right), checkout and reset buttons (middle) and an empty system messages area (bottom).

.PetStore Demo just after Launch
image::Examples/PetStoreExample/1-PetStore-Start-Screen.png[align="center"]


To get to this point, the following things have happened:

. The `main()` method has run and loaded the Rule Base __but not yet fired the rules__. So far, this is the only code in connection with rules that has been run.
. A new `PetStoreUI` object has been created and given a handle to the Rule Base, for later use.
. Various Swing components do their stuff, and the above screen is shown and __waits for user input__.


Clicking on various products from the list might give you a screen similar to the one below.

.PetStore Demo with Products Selected
image::Examples/PetStoreExample/2-stock-added-to-order-list.png[align="center"]


Note that __no rules code has been fired here__.
This is only Swing code, listening for mouse click events, and adding some selected product to the `TableModel` object for display in the top right hand section.
(As an aside, note that this is a classic use of the Model View Controller design pattern).

It is only when we press the "Checkout" button that we fire our business rules, in roughly the same order that we walked through the code earlier.

. Method `CheckOutCallBack.checkout()` is called (eventually) by the Swing class waiting for the click on the "Checkout" button. This inserts the data from the `TableModel` object (top right hand side of the GUI), and inserts it into the Session's Working Memory. It then fires the rules.
. The `"Explode Cart"` rule is the first to fire, given that it has `auto-focus` set to true. It loops through all the products in the cart, ensures that the products are in the Working Memory, and then gives the `"Show Items"` and `Evaluation` agenda groups a chance to fire. The rules in these groups add the contents of the cart to the text area (at the bottom of the window), decide whether or not to give us free fish food, and to ask us whether we want to buy a fish tank. This is shown in the figure below.


.Do we want to buy a fish tank?
image::Examples/PetStoreExample/3-purchase-suggestion.png[align="center"]


. The _Do Checkout_ rule is the next to fire as it (a) No other agenda group currently has focus and (b) it is part of the default (MAIN) agenda group. It always calls the__ doCheckout() function __which displays a 'Would you like to Checkout?' Dialog Box.
. The `doCheckout()` function sets the focus to the `checkout` agenda-group, giving the rules in that group the option to fire.
. The rules in the the `checkout` agenda-group display the contents of the cart and apply the appropriate discount.
. _Swing then waits for user input_ to either checkout more products (and to cause the rules to fire again), or to close the GUI - see the figure below.


.Petstore Demo after all rules have fired.

We could add more System.out calls to demonstrate this flow of events.
The output, as it currently appears in the Console window, is given in the listing below.
