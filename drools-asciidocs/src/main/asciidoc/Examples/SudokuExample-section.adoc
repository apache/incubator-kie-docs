This example demonstrates how Drools can be used to find a solution in a large potential solution space based on a number of constraints.
We use the popular puzzle of Sudoku.
This example also shows how Drools can be integrated into a graphical interface and how callbacks can be used to interact with a running Drools rules engine in order to update the graphical interface based on changes in the Working Memory at runtime.

== Sudoku Overview


Sudoku is a logic-based number placement puzzle.
The objective is to fill a 9x9 grid so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 zones contains the digits from 1 to 9, once, and only once.

The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid and the puzzle solver's task is to complete the grid with these constraints.

The general strategy to solve the problem is to ensure that when you insert a new number it should be unique in its particular 3x3 zone, row and column.

See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku[Wikipedia] for a more detailed description.

== Running the Example


Download and install drools-examples as described above and then execute [path]_java org.drools.examples.DroolsExamplesApp_
 and click on "SudokuExample".

The window contains an empty grid, but the program comes with a number of grids stored internally which can be loaded and solved.
Click on "File", then "Samples" and select "Simple" to load one of the examples.
Note that all buttons are disabled until a grid is loaded.

Alternatively, you may click on the "Step" button to see the next digit found by the rule set.
The Console window will display detailed information about the rules which are executing to solve the step in a human readable form.
Some examples of these messages are presented below.


----

single 8 at [0,1]
column elimination due to [1,2]: remove 9 from [4,2]
hidden single 9 at [1,2]
row elimination due to [2,8]: remove 7 from [2,4]
remove 6 from [3,8] due to naked pair at [3,2] and [3,7]
hidden pair in row at [4,6] and [4,4]
----

Click on the "Dump" button to see the state of the grid, with cells showing either the established value or the remaining  possibilitiescandidates.

Now, let us load a Sudoku grid that is deliberately invalid.
Click on "File", "Samples" and "!DELIBERATELY BROKEN!". Note that this grid starts with some issues, for example the value 5 appears twice in the first row.

.Broken initial state

A few simple rules perform a sanity check, right after loading a grid.
In this case, the following messages are printed on standard output:


----

cell [0,8]: 5 has a duplicate in row 0
cell [0,0]: 5 has a duplicate in row 0
cell [6,0]: 8 has a duplicate in col 0
cell [4,0]: 8 has a duplicate in col 0
Validation complete.
----

Nevertheless, click on the "Solve" button to apply the solving rules to this invalid grid.
This will not complete; some cells remain empty.

The solving functionality has been achieved by the use of rules that implement standard solving techniques.
They are based on the sets of values that are still candidates for a cell.
If, for instance, such a set contains a single value, then this is the value for the cell.
A little less obvious is the single occurrence of a value in one of the groups of nine cells.
The rules detecting these situations insert a fact of type Setting with the solution value for some specific cell.
This fact causes the elimination of this value from all other cells in any of the groups the cell belongs to.
Finally, it is retracted.

Other rules merely reduce the permissible values for some cells.
Rules "naked pair", "hidden pair in row", "hidden pair in column" and "hidden pair in square" merely eliminate possibilities but do not establish solutions.
More sophisticated eliminations are done by "X-wings in rows", "X-wings in columns", "intersection removal row" and "intersection removal column".

== Java Source and Rules Overview


The Java source code can be found in the /src/main/java/org/drools/examples/sudoku directory, with the two DRL files defining the rules located in the /src/main/rules/org/drools/examples/sudoku directory.

The package `org.drools.examples.sudoku.swing` contains a set of classes which implement a framework for Sudoku puzzles.
Note that this package does not have any dependencies on the Drools libraries. `SudokuGridModel` defines an interface which can be implemented to store a Sudoku puzzle as a 9x9 grid of `Cell` objects. `SudokuGridView` is a Swing component which can visualize any implementation of ``SudokuGridModel``. `SudokuGridEvent` and `SudokuGridListener` are used to communicate state changes between the model and the view: events are fired when a cell's value is resolved or changed.
If you are familiar with the model-view-controller patterns in other Swing components such as `JTable` then this pattern should be familiar. `SudokuGridSamples` provides a number of partially filled Sudoku puzzles for demonstration purposes.

Package `org.drools.examples.sudoku.rules` contains a utility class with a method for compiling DRL files.

The package `org.drools.examples.sudoku` contains a set of classes implementing the elementary `Cell` object and its various aggregations: the `CellFile` subtypes `CellRow` and `CellCol` as well as ``CellSqr``, all of which are subtypes of ``CellGroup``.
It's interesting to note that `Cell` and `CellGroup` are subclasses of ``SetOfNine``, which provides a property `free` with the type ``Set<Integer>``.
For a `Cell` it represents the individual candidate set; for a `CellGroup` the set is the union of all candidate sets of its cells, or, simply, the set of digits that still need to be allocated.

With 81 `Cell` and 27 `CellGroup` objects and the linkage provided by the `Cell` properties  ``cellRow``, `cellCol` and `cellSqr` and the `CellGroup` property ``cells``, a list of `Cell` objects, it is possible to write rules that detect the specific situations that permit the allocation of a value to a cell or the elimination of a value from some candidate  set.

An object of class `Setting` is used for triggering the operations that accompany the allocation of a value: its removal from the candidate sets of sibling cells and associated cell groups.
Moreover, the presence of a `Setting` fact is used in all rules that should detect a new situation; this is to avoid reactions to inconsistent intermediary states.

An object of class `Stepping` is used in a low priority rule to execute an emergency halt when a "Step" does not terminate regularly.
This indicates that the puzzle cannot be solved by the program.

The class `org.drools.examples.sudoku.SudokuExample` implements a Java application combining the components described.

== Sudoku Validator Rules (validate.drl)


Validation rules detect duplicate numbers in cell groups.
They are combined in an agenda group which enables us to activate them, explicitly, after loading a puzzle.

The three rules "duplicate in cell..." are very similar.
The first pattern locates a cell with an allocated value.
The second pattern pulls in any of the three cell groups the cell belongs to.
The final pattern would find a cell (other than the first one) with the same value as the first cell and in the same row, column or square, respectively.

Rule "terminate group" fires last.
It prints a message and calls halt.

== Sudoku Solving Rules (sudoku.drl)


There are three types of rules in this file: one group handles the allocation of a number to a cell, another group detects feasible allocations, and the third group eliminates values from candidate sets.

Rules  "set a value", "eliminate a value from Cell" and "retract setting" depend on the presence of a `Setting` object.
The first rule handles the assignment to the cell and the operations for removing the value from the "free" sets of the  cell's three groups.
Also, it decrements a counter that, when zero, returns control to the Java application that has called ``fireUntilHalt()``.
The purpose of rule "eliminate a value from Cell" is to reduce the candidate lists of all cells that are related to the newly assigned cell.
Finally, when all eliminations have been made, rule "retract setting" retracts the triggering `Setting` fact.

There are just two rules that detect a situation where an allocation of a number to a cell is possible.
Rule "single" fires for a `Cell` with a candidate set containing a single number.
Rule "hidden single" fires when there is no cell with a single candidate but when there is a cell containing a candidate but   this candidate is absent from all other cells in one of the three groups the cell belongs to.
Both rules create and insert a `Setting` fact.

Rules from the largest group of rules implement, singly or in groups of two or three, various solving techniques, as they are employed when solving Sudoku puzzles manually.

Rule "naked pair" detects identical candidate sets of size 2 in two cells of a group; these two values may be removed from all other candidate sets of that group.

A similar idea motivates the three rules "hidden pair in..."; here, the rules look for a subset of two numbers in exactly two cells of a group, with neither value occurring in any of the other cells of this group.
This, then, means that all other candidates can be eliminated from the two cells harbouring the hidden pair.

A pair of rules deals with "X-wings" in rows and columns.
When there are only two possible cells for a value in each of two different rows (or columns) and these candidates lie also in the same columns (or rows), then all other candidates for  this value in the columns (or rows) can be eliminated.
If you follow the pattern sequence in one of these rules, you will see how the conditions that are conveniently expressed by words such as "same" or "only" result in patterns with suitable constraints or prefixed with "not".

The rule pair "intersection removal..." is based on the restricted occurrence of some number within one square, either in a single row or in a single column.
This means that this number must be in one of those two or three cells of the row or column; hence it can be removed from the candidate sets of all other cells of the group.
The pattern establishes the restricted occurrence and then fires for each cell outside the square and within the same cell file.

These rules are sufficient for many but certainly not for all Sudoku puzzles.
To solve very difficult grids, the rule set would need to be extended with more complex rules.
(Ultimately, there are puzzles that cannot be solved except by trial and error.)
