The shopping example simulates a very simple shopping cart type application, where the idea is to track a users purchases in a stateful session, and apply discounts as appropriate.

== Running the example


The following is a listing of the interesting parts that are used to launch the example:

[source,java]
----
Customer mark = new Customer( "mark",
                              0 );
session.insert( mark );
Product shoes = new Product( "shoes",
                             60 );
session.insert( shoes );
Product hat = new Product( "hat",
                           60 );
session.insert( hat );
session.insert( new Purchase( mark,
                              shoes ) );
FactHandle hatPurchaseHandle = session.insert( new Purchase( mark,
                                                             hat ) );
session.fireAllRules();
session.retract( hatPurchaseHandle );
System.out.println( "Customer mark has returned the hat" );
session.fireAllRules();
----


Referring the the above listing, we can see there is a Customer ("mark"), and there are 2 Products ("shoes" and "hat") which are available for Purchase.
In this case, a Purchase combines a customer with a product (and a product has a price attribute).

Note that after we fireAllRules(), we then retract the purchase of a hat (but leave the purchase of shoes in). Running the example as a Java application should see the following output:

[source]
----
Customer mark just purchased hat
Customer mark just purchased shoes
Customer mark now has a shopping total of 120.0
Customer mark now has a discount of 10
Customer mark has returned the hat
Customer mark now has a discount of 0
----

== Discounts and purchases


We want to give discounts to customers who purchase stuff of enough value.
This discount could also be removed should the customer decide not to purchase enough to fall within the threshold.

[source]
----
rule "Purchase notification"
    salience 10

 when
  $c : Customer()
  $p : Purchase( customer == $c)
 then
     System.out.println( "Customer " + $c.name + " just purchased " + $p.product.name );
end 

rule "Discount removed notification"
 when
     $c : Customer()
  not Discount( customer == $c )
 then
  $c.discount = 0 ;
  System.out.println( "Customer " + $c.name + " now has a discount of " + $c.discount );
end

rule "Discount awarded notification"
 when
     $c : Customer()
     $d : Discount( customer == $c )
 then
  System.out.println( "Customer " + $c.name + " now has a discount of " + $d.amount );
end
----


The "Purchase notification" rule simply makes note of the purchase event for a given customer.
The "Discount removed notification" rule removes the customer discount (by checking for the non existence of a discount for that customer). The "Discount awarded notification" simply makes not of the fact that the discount was applied.

== Calculating the discount


Calculating the discount is done with a single rule, using the higher order logic of "accumulate".

[source]
----
rule "Apply 10% discount if total purchases is over 100"
 no-loop true
 dialect "java"
    when
      $c : Customer()
      $i : Double(doubleValue  > 100) from accumulate ( Purchase( customer == $c, $price : product.price ), 
                                                            sum( $price ) )
    then
      $c.setDiscount( 10 );
      insertLogical( new Discount($c, 10) );
      System.out.println( "Customer " + $c.getName() + " now has a shopping total of " + $i );
end
----


An interesting part of this rule is the "accumulate": this is saying to accumulate a total (sum) of the $price of a product (product.price) for all Purchase facts that belong to the customer ($c). The result of this is a Double.
The rule then checks to see if this total is greater then 100.
If it is, it applies the discount (of 10), and then inserts a logical fact of the Discount object.

The purpose of the logical insertion of the Discount, is to automatically retract the Discount object should the total of the purchases not add up to > 100 (when the LHS is no longer satisfied, retract the resulting logical assertions - this is what is meant by "truth maintenance"). The act of inserting the Discount, causes the "Discount awarded notification" rule to activate.
However, should the discount fact be retracted, the "Discount removed notification" will activate, resulting in the customers discount being wiped out.
In the example you can see this happen, as after the first fireAllRules(), a purchase is retracted, causing the total to fall below 100, which means the conditions that satisfied the "Apply 10% discount..." rule no longer apply, hence the logical fact of "Discount" is automatically retracted.
