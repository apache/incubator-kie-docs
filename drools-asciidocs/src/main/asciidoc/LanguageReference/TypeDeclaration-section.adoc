Type declarations have two main goals in the rules engine: to allow the declaration of new types, and to allow the declaration of metadata for types.

* *Declaring new types:* Drools works out of the box with plain Java objects as facts. Sometimes, however, users may want to define the model directly to the rules engine, without worrying about creating models in a lower level language like Java. At other times, there is a domain model already built, but eventually the user wants or needs to complement this model with additional entities that are used mainly during the reasoning process.
* *Declaring metadata:* facts may have meta information associated to them. Examples of meta information include any kind of data that is not represented by the fact attributes and is consistent among all instances of that fact type. This meta information may be queried at runtime by the engine and used in the reasoning process.


== Declaring New Types


To declare a new type, all you need to do is use the keyword ``declare``, followed by the list of fields, and the keyword ``end``.
A new fact must have a list of fields, otherwise the engine will look for an existing fact class in the classpath and raise an error if not found.

.Declaring a new fact type: Address
====
[source]
----
declare Address
   number : int
   streetName : String
   city : String
end
----
====


The previous example declares a new fact type called ``Address``.
This fact type will have three attributes: ``number``, `streetName` and ``city``.
Each attribute has a type that can be any valid Java type, including any other class created by the user or even other fact types previously declared.

For instance, we may want to declare another fact type ``Person``:

.declaring a new fact type: Person
====
++++
<programlisting><emphasis role="bold">declare</emphasis> Person
    name : String
    dateOfBirth : java.util.Date
    address : Address
<emphasis role="bold">end</emphasis>
</programlisting>
++++
====


As we can see on the previous example, `dateOfBirth` is of type ``java.util.Date``, from the Java API, while `address` is of the previously defined fact type Address.

You may avoid having to write the fully qualified name of a class every time you write it by using the `import` clause, as previously discussed.

.Avoiding the need to use fully qualified class names by using import
====
++++
<programlisting><emphasis role="bold">import</emphasis> java.util.Date

<emphasis role="bold">declare</emphasis> Person
    name : String
    dateOfBirth : Date
    address : Address
<emphasis role="bold">end</emphasis></programlisting>
++++
====


When you declare a new fact type, Drools will, at compile time, generate bytecode that implements a Java class representing the fact type.
The generated Java class will be a one-to-one Java Bean mapping of the type definition.
So, for the previous example, the generated Java class would be:

.generated Java class for the previous Person fact typedeclaration
====
[source,java]
----
public class Person implements Serializable {
    private String name;
    private java.util.Date dateOfBirth;
    private Address address;

    // empty constructor
    public Person() {...}

    // constructor with all fields 
    public Person( String name, Date dateOfBirth, Address address ) {...}

    // if keys are defined, constructor with keys
    public Person( ...keys... ) {...}

    // getters and setters
    // equals/hashCode
    // toString
}
----
====


Since the generated class is a simple Java class, it can be used transparently in the rules, like any other fact.

.Using the declared types in rules
====
++++
<programlisting><emphasis role="bold">rule</emphasis> "Using a declared Type"
<emphasis role="bold">when</emphasis> 
    $p : Person( name == "Bob" )
<emphasis role="bold">then</emphasis>
    <emphasis>// Insert Mark, who is Bob's mate.</emphasis>
    Person mark = new Person();
    mark.setName("Mark");
    insert( mark );
<emphasis role="bold">end</emphasis></programlisting>
++++
====

=== Declaring enumerative types


DRL also supports the declaration of enumerative types.
Such type declarations require the additional keyword __enum__, followed by a comma separated list of admissible values terminated by a semicolon. 

====
++++
<programlisting><emphasis role="bold">rule</emphasis> "Using a declared Type"
<emphasis role="bold">when</emphasis> 
    $p : Person( name == "Bob" )
<emphasis role="bold">then</emphasis>
    <emphasis>// Insert Mark, who is Bob's mate.</emphasis>
    Person mark = new Person();
    mark.setName("Mark");
    insert( mark );
<emphasis role="bold">end</emphasis></programlisting>
++++
====


The compiler will generate a valid Java enum, with static methods valueOf() and values(), as well as instance methods ordinal(), compareTo() and name().

Complex enums are also partially supported, declaring the internal fields similarly to a regular type declaration.
Notice that as of version 6.x, enum fields do _NOT_ support other declared types or enums

====
++++
<programlisting><emphasis role="bold">declare enum</emphasis> DaysOfWeek
   SUN("Sunday"),MON("Monday"),TUE("Tuesday"),WED("Wednesday"),THU("Thursday"),FRI("Friday"),SAT("Saturday");

   fullName : String
<emphasis role="bold">end</emphasis></programlisting>
++++
====


Enumeratives can then be used in rules

.Using declarative enumerations in rules
====
++++
<programlisting><emphasis role="bold">rule</emphasis> "Using a declared Enum"
<emphasis role="bold">when</emphasis>
   $p : Employee( dayOff == DaysOfWeek.MONDAY )
<emphasis role="bold">then</emphasis>
   ...
<emphasis role="bold">end</emphasis></programlisting>
++++
====

== Declaring Metadata


Metadata may be assigned to several different constructions in Drools: fact types, fact attributes and rules.
Drools uses the at sign ('@') to introduce metadata, and it always uses the form:

[source]
----
@metadata_key( metadata_value )
----


The parenthesized _metadata_value_ is optional.

For instance, if you want to declare a metadata attribute like ``author``, whose value is __Bob__, you could simply write:

.Declaring a metadata attribute
====
[source]
----
@author( Bob )
----
====


Drools allows the declaration of any arbitrary metadata attribute, but some will have special meaning to the engine, while others are simply available for querying at runtime.
Drools allows the declaration of metadata both for fact types and for fact attributes.
Any metadata that is declared before the attributes of a fact type are assigned to the fact type, while metadata declared after an attribute are assigned to that particular attribute.

.Declaring metadata attributes for fact types and attributes
====
++++
<programlisting><emphasis role="bold">import</emphasis> java.util.Date

<emphasis role="bold">declare</emphasis> Person
    <emphasis>@author</emphasis>( Bob )
    <emphasis>@dateOfCreation</emphasis>( 01-Feb-2009 )

    name : String <emphasis>@key @maxLength</emphasis>( 30 )
    dateOfBirth : Date 
    address : Address
<emphasis role="bold">end</emphasis></programlisting>
++++
====


In the previous example, there are two metadata items declared for the fact type (``@author`` and ``@dateOfCreation``) and two more defined for the name attribute (``@key`` and ``@maxLength``). Please note that the `@key` metadata has no required value, and so the parentheses and the value were omitted.:

=== Predefined class level annotations


Some annotations have predefined semantics that are interpreted by the engine.
The following is a list of some of these predefined annotations and their meaning.

==== @role( <fact | event> )


The @role annotation defines how the engine should handle instances of that type: either as regular facts or as events.
It accepts two possible values:

* fact : this is the default, declares that the type is to be handled as a regular fact.
* event : declares that the type is to be handled as an event.


The following example declares that the fact type StockTick in a stock broker application is to be handled as an event.

.declaring a fact type as an event
====
++++
<programlisting><emphasis role="bold">import</emphasis> some.package.StockTick

<emphasis role="bold">declare</emphasis> StockTick
    <emphasis>@role</emphasis>( event )
<emphasis role="bold">end</emphasis></programlisting>
++++
====


The same applies to facts declared inline.
If StockTick was a fact type declared in the DRL itself, instead of a previously existing class, the code would be:

.declaring a fact type and assigning it the event role
====
++++
 <programlisting><emphasis role="bold">declare</emphasis> StockTick 
    <emphasis>@role</emphasis>( event )

    datetime : java.util.Date
    symbol : String
    price : double
<emphasis role="bold">end</emphasis></programlisting>
++++
====

==== @typesafe( <boolean> )


By default all type declarations are compiled with type safety enabled; @typesafe( false ) provides a means to override this behaviour by permitting a fall-back, to type unsafe evaluation where all constraints are generated as MVEL constraints and executed dynamically.
This can be important when dealing with collections that do not have any generics or mixed type collections.

==== @timestamp( <attribute name> )


Every event has an associated timestamp assigned to it.
By default, the timestamp for a given event is read from the Session Clock and assigned to the event at the time the event is inserted into the working memory.
Although, sometimes, the event has the timestamp as one of its own attributes.
In this case, the user may tell the engine to use the timestamp from the event's attribute instead of reading it from the Session Clock.

[source]
----
@timestamp( <attributeName> )
----


To tell the engine what attribute to use as the source of the event's timestamp, just list the attribute name as a parameter to the @timestamp tag.

.declaring the VoiceCall timestamp attribute
====
++++
<programlisting><emphasis role="bold">declare</emphasis> VoiceCall
    <emphasis>@role</emphasis>( event )
    <emphasis>@timestamp</emphasis>( callDateTime )
<emphasis role="bold">end</emphasis></programlisting>
++++
====

==== @duration( <attribute name> )


Drools supports both event semantics: point-in-time events and interval-based events.
A point-in-time event is represented as an interval-based event whose duration is zero.
By default, all events have duration zero.
The user may attribute a different duration for an event by declaring which attribute in the event type contains the duration of the event.

[source]
----
@duration( <attributeName> )
----


So, for our VoiceCall fact type, the declaration would be:

.declaring the VoiceCall duration attribute
====
++++
<programlisting><emphasis role="bold">declare</emphasis> VoiceCall
    <emphasis>@role</emphasis>( event )
    <emphasis>@timestamp</emphasis>( callDateTime )
    <emphasis>@duration</emphasis>( callDuration )
<emphasis role="bold">end</emphasis></programlisting>
++++
====

==== @expires( <time interval> )

[IMPORTANT]
====
This tag is only considered when running the engine in STREAM mode.
Also, additional discussion on the effects of using this tag is made on the Memory Management section.
It is included here for completeness.
====


Events may be automatically expired after some time in the working memory.
Typically this happens when, based on the existing rules in the knowledge base, the event can no longer match and activate any rules.
Although, it is possible to explicitly define when an event should expire.

[source]
----
@expires( <timeOffset> )
----


The value of _timeOffset_ is a temporal interval in the form:

[source]
----
[#d][#h][#m][#s][#[ms]]
----


Where _[ ]_ means an optional parameter and _\#_ means a numeric value.

So, to declare that the VoiceCall facts should be expired after 1 hour and 35 minutes after they are inserted into the working memory, the user would write:

.declaring the expiration offset for the VoiceCall events
====
++++
<programlisting><emphasis role="bold">declare</emphasis> VoiceCall
    <emphasis>@role</emphasis>( event )
    <emphasis>@timestamp</emphasis>( callDateTime )
    <emphasis>@duration</emphasis>( callDuration )
    <emphasis>@expires</emphasis>( 1h35m )
<emphasis role="bold">end</emphasis></programlisting>
++++
====


The @expires policy will take precedence and override the implicit expiration offset calculated from temporal constraints and sliding windows in the knowledge base.

==== @propertyChangeSupport


Facts that implement support for property changes as defined in the Javabean(tm) spec, now can be annotated so that the engine register itself to listen for changes on fact properties.
The boolean parameter that was used in the insert() method in the Drools 4 API is deprecated and does not exist in the drools-api module.

.@propertyChangeSupport
====
++++
<programlisting><emphasis role="bold">declare</emphasis> Person
  <emphasis role="italic">@propertyChangeSupport</emphasis>
<emphasis role="bold">end</emphasis></programlisting>
++++
====

==== @propertyReactive


Make this type property reactive.
See Fine grained property change listeners section for details.

=== Predefined attribute level annotations


As noted before, Drools also supports annotations in type attributes.
Here is a list of predefined attribute annotations.

==== @key


Declaring an attribute as a key attribute has 2 major effects on generated types:



. The attribute will be used as a key identifier for the type, and as so, the generated class will implement the equals() and hashCode() methods taking the attribute into account when comparing instances of this type.
. Drools will generate a constructor using all the key attributes as parameters.

For instance:

.example of @key declarations for a type
====
++++
<programlisting><emphasis role="bold">declare</emphasis> Person
    firstName : String @key
    lastName : String @key
    age : int
<emphasis role="bold">end</emphasis></programlisting>
++++
====


For the previous example, Drools will generate equals() and hashCode() methods that will check the firstName and lastName attributes to determine if two instances of Person are equal to each other, but will not check the age attribute.
It will also generate a constructor taking firstName and lastName as parameters, allowing one to create instances with a code like this:

.creating an instance using the key constructor
====
[source]
----
Person person = new Person( "John", "Doe" );
----
====

==== @position


Patterns support positional arguments on type declarations.

Positional arguments are ones where you don't need to specify the field name, as the position maps to a known named field.
i.e.
Person( name == "mark" ) can be rewritten as Person( "mark"; ). The semicolon ';' is important so that the engine knows that everything before it is a positional argument.
Otherwise we might assume it was a boolean expression, which is how it could be interpreted after the semicolon.
You can mix positional and named arguments on a pattern by using the semicolon ';' to separate them.
Any variables used in a positional that have not yet been bound will be bound to the field that maps to that position.

++++
<programlisting><emphasis role="bold">declare</emphasis> Cheese
    name : String
    shop : String
    price : int
<emphasis role="bold">end</emphasis></programlisting>
++++

The default order is the declared order, but this can be overridden using @position

++++
<programlisting><emphasis role="bold">declare</emphasis> Cheese
    name : String <emphasis role="italic">@position(1)</emphasis>
    shop : String <emphasis role="italic">@position(2)</emphasis>
    price : int <emphasis role="italic">@position(0)</emphasis>
<emphasis role="bold">end</emphasis></programlisting>
++++


The @Position annotation, in the org.drools.definition.type package, can be used to annotate original pojos on the classpath.
Currently only fields on classes can be annotated.
Inheritance of classes is supported, but not interfaces of methods yet.

Example patterns, with two constraints and a binding.
Remember semicolon ';' is used to differentiate the positional section from the named argument section.
Variables and literals and expressions using just literals are supported in positional arguments, but not variables.

[source]
----
Cheese( "stilton", "Cheese Shop", p; )
Cheese( "stilton", "Cheese Shop"; p : price )
Cheese( "stilton"; shop == "Cheese Shop", p : price )
Cheese( name == "stilton"; shop == "Cheese Shop", p : price )
----

@Position is inherited when beans extend each other; while not recommended, two fields may have the same @position value, and not all consecutive values need be declared.
If a @position is repeated, the conflict is solved using inheritance (fields in the superclass have the precedence) and the declaration order.
If a @position value is missing, the first field without an explicit @position (if any) is selected to fill the gap.
As always, conflicts are resolved by inheritance and declaration order.

++++
<programlisting><emphasis role="bold">declare</emphasis> Cheese
    name : String 
    shop : String <emphasis role="italic">@position(2)</emphasis>
    price : int <emphasis role="italic">@position(0)</emphasis>
<emphasis role="bold">end</emphasis>

<emphasis role="bold">declare</emphasis> SeasonedCheese <emphasis role="bold">extends</emphasis> Cheese
    year : Date <emphasis role="italic">@position(0)</emphasis>
    origin : String <emphasis role="italic">@position(6)</emphasis>
    country : String    
<emphasis role="bold">end</emphasis></programlisting>
++++

In the example, the field order would be : price (@position 0 in the superclass), year (@position 0 in the subclass), name (first field with no @position), shop (@position 2), country (second field without @position), origin.

== Declaring Metadata for Existing Types


Drools allows the declaration of metadata attributes for existing types in the same way as when declaring metadata attributes for new fact types.
The only difference is that there are no fields in that declaration.

For instance, if there is a class org.drools.examples.Person, and one wants to declare metadata for it, it's possible to write the following code:

.Declaring metadata for an existing type
====
++++
<programlisting><emphasis role="bold">import</emphasis> org.drools.examples.Person

<emphasis role="bold">declare</emphasis> Person
    <emphasis>@author</emphasis>( Bob )
    <emphasis>@dateOfCreation</emphasis>( 01-Feb-2009 )
<emphasis role="bold">end</emphasis></programlisting>
++++
====


Instead of using the import, it is also possible to reference the class by its fully qualified name, but since the class will also be referenced in the rules, it is usually shorter to add the import and use the short class name everywhere.

.Declaring metadata using the fully qualified class name
====
++++
 <programlisting><emphasis role="bold">declare</emphasis> org.drools.examples.Person
    <emphasis>@author</emphasis>( Bob )
    <emphasis>@dateOfCreation</emphasis>( 01-Feb-2009 )
<emphasis role="bold">end</emphasis></programlisting>
++++
====

== Parametrized constructors for declared types


Generate constructors with parameters for declared types.

Example: for a declared type like the following:

++++
<programlisting><emphasis role="bold">declare</emphasis> Person
    firstName : String <emphasis role="italic">@key</emphasis>
    lastName : String <emphasis role="italic">@key</emphasis>
    age : int
<emphasis role="bold">end</emphasis>
</programlisting>
++++


The compiler will implicitly generate 3 constructors: one without parameters, one with the @key fields, and one with all fields.

[source]
----
Person() // parameterless constructor
Person( String firstName, String lastName )
Person( String firstName, String lastName, int age )
----

== Non Typesafe Classes


@typesafe( <boolean>) has been added to type declarations.
By default all type declarations are compiled with type safety enabled; @typesafe( false ) provides a means to override this behaviour by permitting a fall-back, to type unsafe evaluation where all constraints are generated as MVEL constraints and executed dynamically.
This can be important when dealing with collections that do not have any generics or mixed type collections.

== Accessing Declared Types from the Application Code


Declared types are usually used inside rules files, while Java models are used when sharing the model between rules and applications.
Although, sometimes, the application may need to access and handle facts from the declared types, especially when the application is wrapping the rules engine and providing higher level, domain specific user interfaces for rules management.

In such cases, the generated classes can be handled as usual with the Java Reflection API, but, as we know, that usually requires a lot of work for small results.
Therefore, Drools provides a simplified API for the most common fact handling the application may want to do.

The first important thing to realize is that a declared fact will belong to the package where it was declared.
So, for instance, in the example below, `Person` will belong to the `org.drools.examples` package, and so the fully qualified name of the generated class will be ``org.drools.examples.Person``.

.Declaring a type in the org.drools.examples package
====
++++
<programlisting><emphasis role="bold">package</emphasis> org.drools.examples

<emphasis role="bold">import</emphasis> java.util.Date

<emphasis role="bold">declare</emphasis> Person
    name : String
    dateOfBirth : Date
    address : Address
<emphasis role="bold">end</emphasis></programlisting>
++++
====


Declared types, as discussed previously, are generated at knowledge base compilation time, i.e., the application will only have access to them at application run time.
Therefore, these classes are not available for direct reference from the application.

Drools then provides an interface through which users can handle declared types from the application code: ``org.drools.definition.type.FactType``.
Through this interface, the user can instantiate, read and write fields in the declared fact types.

.Handling declared fact types through the API
====
[source,java]
----
// get a reference to a knowledge base with a declared type:
KieBase kbase = ...

// get the declared FactType
FactType personType = kbase.getFactType( "org.drools.examples",
                                         "Person" );

// handle the type as necessary:
// create instances:
Object bob = personType.newInstance();

// set attributes values
personType.set( bob,
                "name",
                "Bob" );
personType.set( bob,
                "age",
                42 );

// insert fact into a session
KieSession ksession = ...
ksession.insert( bob );
ksession.fireAllRules();

// read attributes
String name = personType.get( bob, "name" );
int age = personType.get( bob, "age" );
----
====


The API also includes other helpful methods, like setting all the attributes at once, reading values from a Map, or reading all attributes at once, into a Map.

Although the API is similar to Java reflection (yet much simpler to use), it does not use reflection underneath, relying on much more performant accessors implemented with generated bytecode.

== Type Declaration 'extends'


Type declarations now support 'extends' keyword for inheritance

In order to extend a type declared in Java by a DRL declared subtype, repeat the supertype in a declare statement without any fields.

++++
<programlisting>b org.people.Person

<emphasis role="bold">declare</emphasis> Person <emphasis role="bold">end</emphasis>

<emphasis role="bold">declare</emphasis> Student <emphasis role="bold">extends</emphasis> Person
    school : String
<emphasis role="bold">end</emphasis>

<emphasis role="bold">declare</emphasis> LongTermStudent <emphasis role="bold">extends</emphasis> Student
    years : int
    course : String
<emphasis role="bold">end</emphasis></programlisting>
++++

== Traits


WARNING : this feature is still experimental and subject to changes

The same fact may have multiple dynamic types which do not fit naturally in a class hierarchy.
Traits allow to model this very common scenario.
A trait is an interface that can be applied (and eventually removed) to an individual object at runtime.
To create a trait rather than a traditional bean, one has to declare them explicitly as in the following example:

====
++++
<programlisting><emphasis role="bold">declare</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">trait</emphasis> GoldenCustomer
    // fields will map to getters/setters
    code     : String
    balance  : long
    discount : int
    maxExpense : long
<emphasis role="bold">end</emphasis></programlisting>
++++
====


At runtime, this declaration results in an interface, which can be used to write patterns, but can not be instantiated directly.
In order to apply a trait to an object, we provide the new don keyword, which can be used as simply as this:

====
[source]
----
when
    $c : Customer()
then
    GoldenCustomer gc = don( $c, GoldenCustomer.class );
end
----
====


when a core object dons a trait, a proxy class is created on the fly (one such class will be generated lazily for each core/trait class combination). The proxy instance, which wraps the core object and implements the trait interface, is inserted automatically and will possibly activate other rules.
An immediate advantage of declaring and using interfaces, getting the implementation proxy for free from the engine, is that multiple inheritance hierarchies can be exploited when writing rules.
The core classes, however, need not implement any of those interfaces statically, also facilitating the use of legacy classes as cores.
In fact, any object can don a trait, provided that they are declared as @Traitable.
Notice that this annotation used to be optional, but now is mandatory.

====
++++
<programlisting><emphasis role="bold">import</emphasis> org.drools.core.factmodel.traits.Traitable;
<emphasis role="bold">declare</emphasis> Customer
    <emphasis role="italic">@Traitable</emphasis>
    code    : String
    balance : long
<emphasis role="bold">end</emphasis></programlisting>
++++
====


The only connection between core classes and trait interfaces is at the proxy level: a trait is not specifically tied to a core class.
This means that the same trait can be applied to totally different objects.
For this reason, the trait does not transparently expose the fields of its core object.
So, when writing a rule using a trait interface, only the fields of the interface will be available, as usual.
However, any field in the interface that corresponds to a core object field, will be mapped by the proxy class:

====
[source]
----
when
    $o: OrderItem( $p : price, $code : custCode )
    $c: GoldenCustomer( code == $code, $a : balance, $d: discount )
then
    $c.setBalance( $a - $p*$d );
end
----
====


In this case, the code and balance would be read from the underlying Customer object.
Likewise, the setAccount will modify the underlying object, preserving a strongly typed access to the data structures.
A hard field must have the same name and type both in the core class and all donned interfaces.
The name is used to establish the mapping: if two fields have the same name, then they must also have the same declared type.
The annotation @org.drools.core.factmodel.traits.Alias allows to relax this restriction.
If an @Alias is provided, its value string will be used to resolve mappings instead of the original field name.
@Alias can be applied both to traits and core beans. 

====
++++
<programlisting>import org.drools.core.factmodel.traits.*;
<emphasis role="bold">declare</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">trait</emphasis> GoldenCustomer
    balance : long <emphasis role="italic">@Alias( "org.acme.foo.accountBalance" )</emphasis>
<emphasis role="bold">end</emphasis>

<emphasis role="bold">declare</emphasis> Person
    <emphasis role="italic">@Traitable</emphasis>
    name : String
    savings : long <emphasis role="italic">@Alias( "org.acme.foo.accountBalance" )</emphasis>
<emphasis role="bold">end</emphasis>

when
    GoldenCustomer( balance > 1000 ) // will react to new Person( 2000 )
then
end</programlisting>
++++
====

More work is being done on relaxing this constraint (see the experimental section on "logical" traits later). Now, one might wonder what happens when a core class does NOT provide the implementation for a field defined in an interface.
We call hard fields those trait fields which are also core fields and thus readily available, while we define soft those fields which are NOT provided by the core class.
Hidden fields, instead, are fields in the core class not exposed by the interface.

So, while hard field management is intuitive, there remains the problem of soft and hidden fields.
Hidden fields are normally only accessible using the core class directly.
However, the "fields" Map can be used on a trait interface to access a hidden field.
If the field can't be resolved, null will be returned.
Notice that this feature is likely to change in the future.

====
[source]
----
when
    $sc : GoldenCustomer( fields[ "age" ] > 18 )  // age is declared by the underlying core class, but not by GoldenCustomer
then
----
====


Soft fields, instead, are stored in a Map-like data structure that is specific to each core object and referenced by the proxy(es), so that they are effectively shared even when an object dons multiple traits.

====
[source]
----
when
    $sc : GoldenCustomer( $c : code, // hard getter
                          $maxExpense : maxExpense > 1000 // soft getter
    )
then
    $sc.setDiscount( ... ); // soft setter
end
----
====


A core object also holds a reference to all its proxies, so that it is possible to track which type(s) have been added to an object, using a sort of dynamic "instanceof" operator, which we called isA.
The operator can accept a String, a class literal or a list of class literals.
In the latter case, the constraint is satisfied only if all the traits have been donned. 

====
[source]
----
$sc : GoldenCustomer( $maxExpense : maxExpense > 1000,
                      this isA "SeniorCustomer", this isA [ NationalCustomer.class, OnlineCustomer.class ]
)

Eventually, the business logic may require that a trait is removed from a wrapped object.
To this end, we provide two options.
The first is a "logical don", which will result in a logical insertion of the proxy resulting from the traiting operation.
The TMS will ensure that the trait is removed when its logical support is removed in the first place.

====
++++
<programlisting>then
    <emphasis role="bold">don</emphasis>( $x, // core object
         Customer.class, // trait class
         true // optional flag for logical insertion
    )</programlisting>
++++
====


The second is the use of the "shed" keyword, which causes the removal of any type that is a subtype (or equivalent) of the one passed as an argument.
Notice that, as of version 5.5, shed would only allow to remove a single specific trait.

====
++++
<programlisting>then
    Thing t = <emphasis role="bold">shed</emphasis>( $x, GoldenCustomer.class ) // also removes any trait that</programlisting>
++++
====


This operation returns another proxy implementing the org.drools.core.factmodel.traits.Thing interface, where the getFields() and getCore() methods are defined.
Internally, in fact, all declared traits are generated to extend this interface (in addition to any others specified).      This allows to preserve the wrapper with the soft fields which would otherwise be lost.

A trait and its proxies are also correlated in another way.
Starting from version 5.6, whenever a core object is "modified", its proxies are "modified" automatically as well, to allow trait-based patterns to react to potential changes in hard fields.
Likewise, whenever a trait proxy (mached by a trait pattern) is modified, the modification is propagated to the core class and the other traits.
Morover, whenever a don operation is performed, the core object is also modified automatically, to reevaluate any "isA" operation which may be triggered.

Potentially, this may result in a high number of modifications, impacting performance (and correctness) heavily.
So two solutions are currently implemented.
First, whenever a core object is modified, only the most specific traits (in the sense of inheritance between trait interfaces) are updated and an internal blocking mechanism is in place to ensure that each potentially matching pattern is evaluated once and only once.
So, in the following situation:

++++
<programlisting><emphasis role="bold">declare</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">trait</emphasis> GoldenCustomer <emphasis role="bold">end</emphasis>
<emphasis role="bold">declare</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">trait</emphasis> NationalGoldenustomer <emphasis role="bold">extends</emphasis> GoldenCustomer <emphasis role="bold">end</emphasis>
<emphasis role="bold">declare</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">trait</emphasis> SeniorGoldenCustomer <emphasis role="bold">extends</emphasis> GoldenCustomer <emphasis role="bold">end</emphasis></programlisting>
++++


a modification of an object that is both a GoldenCustomer, a NationalGoldenCustomer and a SeniorGoldenCustomer wold cause only the latter two proxies to be actually modified.
The first would match any pattern for GoldenCustomer and NationalGoldenCustomer; the latter would instead be prevented from rematching GoldenCustomer, but would be allowed to match SeniorGoldenCustomer patterns.
It is not necessary, instead, to modify the GoldenCustomer proxy since it is already covered by at least one other more specific trait.

The second method, up to the usr, is to mark traits as @PropertyReactive.
Property reactivity is trait-enabled and takes into account the trait field mappings, so to block unnecessary propagations. 

=== Cascading traits

*WARNING* : This feature is extremely experimental and subject to changes

Normally, a hard field must be exposed with its original type by all traits donned by an object, to prevent situations such as

====
++++
<programlisting><emphasis role="bold">declare</emphasis> Person
  @Traitable
  name : String
  id : String
<emphasis role="bold">end</emphasis>

<emphasis role="bold">declare</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">trait</emphasis> Customer
  id : String
<emphasis role="bold">end</emphasis>

<emphasis role="bold">declare</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">trait</emphasis> Patient
  id : long  // Person can't don Patient, or an exception will be thrown
<emphasis role="bold">end</emphasis></programlisting>
++++
====


Should a Person don both Customer and Patient, the type of the hard field id would be ambiguous.
However, consider the following example, where GoldenCustomers refer their best friends so that they become Customers as well:

====
++++
<programlisting><emphasis role="bold">declare</emphasis> Person
  @Traitable( logical=true )
  bestFriend : Person
<emphasis role="bold">end</emphasis>

<emphasis role="bold">declare</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">trait</emphasis> Customer <emphasis role="bold">end</emphasis>
        
<emphasis role="bold">declare</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">trait</emphasis> GoldenCustomer <emphasis role="bold">extends</emphasis> Customer
  refers : Customer <emphasis role="italic">@Alias( "bestFriend" )</emphasis>
<emphasis role="bold">end</emphasis></programlisting>
++++
====


Aside from the @Alias, a Person-as-GoldenCustomer's best friend might be compatible with the requirements of the trait GoldenCustomer, provided that they are some kind of Customer themselves.
Marking a Person as "logically traitable" - i.e.
adding the annotation @Traitable( logical = true ) - will instruct the engine to try and preserve the logical consistency rather than throwing an exception due to a hard field with different type declarations (Person vs Customer). The following operations would then work:

====
[source]
----
Person p1 = new Person();
Person p2 = new Person();
p1.setBestFriend( p2 );
...
Customer c2 = don( p2, Customer.class );
...
GoldenCustomer gc1 = don( p1, GoldenCustomer.class );
...
p1.getBestFriend(); // returns p2
gc1.getRefers(); // returns c2, a Customer proxy wrapping p2
----
====


Notice that, by the time p1 becomes GoldenCustomer, p2 must have already become a Customer themselves, otherwise a runtime exception will be thrown since the very definition of GoldenCustomer would have been violated.

In some cases, however, one might want to infer, rather than verify, that p2 is a Customer by virtue that p1 is a GoldenCustomer.
This modality can be enabled by marking Customer as "logical", using the annotation @org.drools.core.factmodel.traits.Trait( logical = true ). In this case, should p2 not be a Customer by the time that p1 becomes a GoldenCustomer, it will be automatically don the trait Customer to preserve the logical integrity of the system.

Notice that the annotation on the core class enables the dynamic type management for its fields, whereas the annotation on the traits determines whether they will be enforced as integrity constraints or cascaded dynamically.
