== Getting the Examples

Make sure the Drools Eclipse plugin is installed, which needs the Graphical Editing Framework (GEF) dependency installed first.
Then download and extract the drools-examples zip file, which includes an already created Eclipse project.
Import that project into a new Eclipse workspace.
The rules all have example classes that execute the rules.
If you want to try the examples in another project (or another IDE) then you will need to set up the dependencies by hand, of course.
Many, but not all of the examples are documented below, enjoy!

Some examples require Java 1.6 to run.
