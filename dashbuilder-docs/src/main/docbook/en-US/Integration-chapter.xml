  <title>Integration with external systems</title>

  <para>Despite Dashbuilder is an standalone dashboard composition tooling,
    integration with external systems might be required. For instance:
  </para>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>Imagine a third-party web app which relies on Dashbuilder to provide
        the monitoring capabilities. The web app requires to embed a chart into one
        of its pages. This would be an example of content syndication.
      </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>Imagine also another application which want to push/pull data from
        Dashbuilder. A SAP system, for instance, which want to push a new purchase order
        to an specific Dashbuilder data provider, or a external alert management system which requires
        to evaluate the current value for a given KPI.
      </para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>


  <para>These and many others are examples of integration uses cases. This chapter walks through
    the different mechanisms that Dashbuilder provides in that direction.
