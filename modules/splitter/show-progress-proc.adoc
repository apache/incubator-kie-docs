= Solve and listen to show progress

When a solver is running while a user is waiting for a solution,
the user might need to wait for several minutes or hours before receiving a result.
To assure the user that everything is going well,
show progress by displaying the best solution and best score attained so far.

.Procedure
. To handle intermediate best solutions, use `solveAndListen(...)`:

----
public class TimeTableService {

    private SolverManager<TimeTable, Long> solverManager;

    // Returns immediately
    public void solveLive(Long timeTableId) {
        solverManager.solveAndListen(timeTableId,
                // Called once, when solving starts
                this::findById,
                // Called multiple times, for every best solution change
                this::save);
    }

    public TimeTable findById(Long timeTableId) {...}

    public void save(TimeTable timeTable) {...}

    public void stopSolving(Long timeTableId) {
        solverManager.terminateEarly(timeTableId);
    }

}

This implementation is using the database to communicate with the UI, which polls the database.
More advanced implementations push the best solutions directly to the UI or a messaging queue.

. When the user is satisfied with the intermediate best solution
and does not want to wait any longer for a better one, call `SolverManager.terminateEarly(problemId)`.
