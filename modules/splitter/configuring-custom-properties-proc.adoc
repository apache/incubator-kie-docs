= Configuring custom properties

In your OptaPlanner projects, you can add custom properties to solver configuration elements that instantiate classes and have documents that explicitly mention custom properties.

.Prerequisites
* You have a solver.

.Procedure
. Add a custom property.
+
For example, if your `EasyScoreCalculator` has heavy calculations which are cached
and you want to increase the cache size in one benchmark add the `myCacheSize` property:
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
  <scoreDirectorFactory>
    <easyScoreCalculatorClass>...MyEasyScoreCalculator</easyScoreCalculatorClass>
    <easyScoreCalculatorCustomProperties>
      <property name="myCacheSize" value="1000"/><!-- Override value -->
    </easyScoreCalculatorCustomProperties>
  </scoreDirectorFactory>
----

. Add a public setter for each custom property, which is called when a `Solver` is built.
+
[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
public class MyEasyScoreCalculator extends EasyScoreCalculator<MySolution, SimpleScore> {

        private int myCacheSize = 500; // Default value

        @SuppressWarnings("unused")
        public void setMyCacheSize(int myCacheSize) {
            this.myCacheSize = myCacheSize;
        }

    ...
}
----
+
Most value types are supported, including `boolean`, `int`, `double`, `BigDecimal`, `String` and `enums`.
