= {PLANNER_SHORT} annotation

You must specify which classes in your domain model are planning entities, which properties are planning variables, and so on. Use one of the following methods to add annotations to your {PLANNER_SHORT} project:

* Add class annotations and JavaBean property annotations on the domain model.  The property annotations must be on the getter method, not on the setter method. Annotated  getter methods do not need to be public. This is the recommended method.
* Add class annotations and field annotations on the domain model. Annotated fields do not need to be public.
