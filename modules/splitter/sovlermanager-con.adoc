= The {PLANNER_SHORT} SolverManager

A `SolverManager` is a facade for one or more `Solver` instances
to simplify solving planning problems in REST and other enterprise services.

Unlike the `Solver.solve(...)` method, a `SolverManager` has the following characteristics:

* `SolverManager.solve(...)` returns immediately: it schedules a problem for asynchronous solving without blocking the calling thread.
This avoids timeout issues of HTTP and other technologies.
* `SolverManager.solve(...)` solves multiple planning problems of the same domain, in parallel.

Internally, a `SolverManager` manages a thread pool of solver threads, which call `Solver.solve(...)`,
and a thread pool of consumer threads, which handle best solution changed events.

In Quarkus and Spring Boot, the `SolverManager` instance is automatically injected in your code.
If you are using a platform other than Quarkus or Spring Boot, build a `SolverManager` instance with the `create(...)` method:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
SolverConfig solverConfig = SolverConfig.createFromXmlResource(".../cloudBalancingSolverConfig.xml");
SolverManager<CloudBalance, UUID> solverManager = SolverManager.create(solverConfig, new SolverManagerConfig());
----

Each problem submitted to the `SolverManager.solve(...)` methods must have a unique problem ID.
Later calls to `getSolverStatus(problemId)` or `terminateEarly(problemId)` use that problem ID
to distinguish between planning problems.
The problem ID must be an immutable class, such as `Long`, `String`, or `java.util.UUID`.

The `SolverManagerConfig` class has a `parallelSolverCount` property
that controls how many solvers are run in parallel.
For example, if the `parallelSolverCount` property` is set to `4` and you submit five problems, four problems start solving immediately and the fifth problem starts when one of the first problems ends. If those problems solve for five minutes each, the fifth problem takes 10 minutes to finish. By default, `parallelSolverCount` is set to `AUTO`, which resolves to half the CPU cores, regardless of the `moveThreadCount` of the solvers.

To retrieve the best solution, after solving terminates normally use `SolverJob.getFinalBestSolution()`:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
CloudBalance problem1 = ...;
UUID problemId = UUID.randomUUID();
// Returns immediately
SolverJob<CloudBalance, UUID> solverJob = solverManager.solve(problemId, problem1);
...
CloudBalance solution1;
try {
    // Returns only after solving terminates
    solution1 = solverJob.getFinalBestSolution();
} catch (InterruptedException | ExecutionException e) {
    throw ...;
}
----

However, there are better approaches, both for solving batch problems before a user needs the solution as well as for live solving while a user is actively waiting for the solution.

The current `SolverManager` implementation runs on a single computer node,
but future work aims to distribute solver loads across a cloud.
