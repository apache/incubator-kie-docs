= Monitoring the solver
OptaPlanner exposes metrics through https://micrometer.io/[Micrometer], a metrics instrumentation library for Java applications. You can use Micrometer with popular monitoring systems to monitor the OptaPlanner solver.

== Configuring a Quarkus OptaPlanner application for Micrometer
To configure your OptaPlanner Quarkus application to use Micrometer and a specified monitoring system, add the Micrometer dependency to the `pom.xml` file.

.Prerequisites
* You have a Quarkus OptaPlanner application.

.Procedure
. Add the following dependency to your application's `pom.xml` file where `<MONITORING_SYSTEM>` is a monitoring system supported by Micrometer and Quarkus:
+
NOTE: Prometheus is currently the only monitoring system supported by Quarkus.
+
[source]
----
<dependency>
 <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
 <artifactId>quarkus-micrometer-registry-<MONITORING_SYSTEM></artifactId>
</dependency>
----
. To run the application in development mode, enter the following command:
+
[source]
----
mvn compile quarkus:dev
----
. To view metrics for your application, enter the following URL in a browser:
+
[source]
----
http://localhost:8080/q/metrics
----

== Configuring a Spring Boot OptaPlanner application for Micrometer
To configure your Spring Boot OptaPlanner  application to use Micrometer and a specified monitoring system, add the Micrometer dependency to the `pom.xml` file.

.Prerequisites
* You have a Spring Boot OptaPlanner  application.

.Procedure
. Add the following dependency to your application's `pom.xml` file where `<MONITORING_SYSTEM>` is a monitoring system supported by Micrometer and Spring Boot:
+
[source]
----
<dependency>
 <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
 <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
 <groupId>io.micrometer</groupId>
 <artifactId>micrometer-registry-<MONITORING_SYSTEM></artifactId>
</dependency>
----
. Add configuration information to the application's `application.properties` file. For information, see the https://micrometer.io[Micrometer] web site.

. To run the application, enter the following command:
+
[source]
----
mvn spring-boot:run
----

. To view metrics for your application, enter the following URL in a browser:
+
http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics

+
NOTE: Use the following URL as the Prometheus scraper path:
`http://localhost:8080/actuator/prometheus`

== Configuring a plain Java OptaPlanner application for Micrometer
To configuring a plain Java OptaPlanner application to use Micrometer, you must add Micrometer dependencies and configuration information for your chosen monitoring system to your project's `POM.XML` file.


.Prerequisites
* You have a plain Java OptaPlanner application.

.Procedure
. Add the following dependencies to your application's `pom.xml` file where `<MONITORING_SYSTEM>` is a monitoring system that is configured with Micrometer and `<VERSION>` is the version of Micrometer that you are using:
+
[source]
----
<dependency>
 <groupId>io.micrometer</groupId>
 <artifactId>micrometer-registry-<MONITORING_SYSTEM></artifactId>
 <version><VERSION></version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
 <groupId>io.micrometer</groupId>
 <artifactId>micrometer-core</artifactId>
 <version>`<VERSION>`</version>
</dependency>
----
. Add Micrometer configuration information for your monitoring system to the beginning of your project's `pom.xml` file. For information, see the https://micrometer.io[Micrometer] web site.
. Add the following line below the configuration information, where `<MONITORING_SYSTEM>` is the monitoring system that you added:
+
[source,java,nowrap]
----
Metrics.addRegistry(<MONITORING_SYSTEM>);
----
The following example shows how to add the Prometheus monitoring system:
+
[source,java,nowrap]
----
PrometheusMeterRegistry prometheusRegistry = new PrometheusMeterRegistry(PrometheusConfig.DEFAULT);
try {
    HttpServer server = HttpServer.create(new InetSocketAddress(8080), 0);
    server.createContext("/prometheus", httpExchange -> {
        String response = prometheusRegistry.scrape();
        httpExchange.sendResponseHeaders(200, response.getBytes().length);
        try (OutputStream os = httpExchange.getResponseBody()) {
            os.write(response.getBytes());
        }
    });
    new Thread(server::start).start();
} catch (IOException e) {
    throw new RuntimeException(e);
}
Metrics.addRegistry(prometheusRegistry);
----

. Open your monitoring system to view the metrics for your OptaPlanner project. The following metrics are exposed:
+
[NOTE]
====
The names and format of the metrics vary depending on the registry.
====
+
* `optaplanner.solver.errors.total`: the total number of errors that occurred while solving since the start
of the measuring.
* `optaplanner.solver.solve-length.active-count`: the number of solvers currently solving.
* `optaplanner.solver.solve-length.seconds-max`: run time of the
longest-running currently active solver.
* `optaplanner.solver.solve-length.seconds-duration-sum`: the sum of each active solver's solve duration. For example, if there are two active solvers, one running for three minutes and the other for one minute, the total solve time is four minutes.
