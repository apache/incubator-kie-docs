= The {PLANNER_SHORT} Solver
A solver finds the best and optimal solution to your planning problem. A solver can only solve one planning problem instance at a time. Solvers are built with the `SolverFactory` method:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
public interface Solver<Solution_> {

    Solution_ solve(Solution_ problem);

    ...
}
----

A solver should only be accessed from a single thread, except for the methods that are specifically documented in `javadoc` as being thread-safe. The `solve()` method hogs the current thread. Hogging the thread can cause HTTP timeouts for REST services and it requires extra code to solve multiple data sets in parallel. To avoid such issues, use a `SolverManager` instead.
