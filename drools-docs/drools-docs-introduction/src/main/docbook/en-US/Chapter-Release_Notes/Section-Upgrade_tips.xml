  <title>Upgrade tips from Drools 3.0.x to Drools 4.0.x</title>

  <para>As mentioned before Drools 4.0 is a major update over the previous
  Drools 3.0.x series. Unfortunately, in order to achieve the goals set for
  this release, some backward compatibility issues were introduced, as
  discussed in the mail list and blogs.</para>

  <para>This section of the manual is a work in progress and will document a
  simple how-to on upgrading from Drools 3.0.x to Drools 4.0.x.</para>

  <section>
    <title>API changes</title>

    <para>There are a few API changes that are visible to regular users and
    need to be fixed.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Working Memory creation</title>

      <para>Drools 3.0.x had only one working memory type that worked like a
      stateful working memory. Drools 4.0.x introduces separate APIs for
      Stateful and Stateless working memories that are called now Rule
      Sessions. In Drools 3.0.x, the code to create a working memory
      was:</para>

      <example>
          <title>Drools 3.0.x: Working Memory Creation</title>

          <programlisting role="JAVA">WorkingMemory wm = rulebase.newWorkingMemory();</programlisting>
        </example>
      <para>In Drools 4.0.x it must be changed to:</para>

      <example>
          <title>Drools 4.0.x: Stateful Rule Session Creation</title>

          <programlisting role="JAVA">StatefulSession wm = rulebase.newStatefulSession();</programlisting>
        </example>
      <para>The StatefulSession object has the same behavior as the
      Drools 3.0.x WorkingMemory (it even extends the WorkingMemory
      interface), so there should be no other problems with this fix.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Working Memory Actions</title>

      <para>Drools 4.0.x now supports pluggable dialects and has built-in
      support for Java and MVEL scripting language. In order to avoid keyword
      conflicts, the working memory actions were renamed as showed
      bellow:</para>

    <title>Rule Language Changes</title>

    <para>The DRL Rule Language also has some backward incompatible changes as
    detailed bellow.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Working Memory Actions</title>

      <para>The Working Memory actions in rule consequences were also changed
      in a similar way to the change made in the API. The following table
      summarizes the change:</para>

      <title>Primitive support and unboxing</title>

      <para>Drools 3.0.x did not had native support for primitive types and
      consequently, it auto-boxed all primitives in it's respective wrapper
      classes. That way, any use of a boxed variable binding required a manual
      unbox.</para>

      <para>Drools 4.0.x has full support for primitive types and does not
      wrap values anymore. So, all previous unwrap method calls must be
      removed from the DRL.</para>

      <example>
        <title>Drools 3.0.x manual unwrap</title>

        <programlisting>rule "Primitive int manual unbox"
when
    $c : Cheese( $price : price )
then
    $c.setPrice( $price<emphasis role="bold">.intValue()</emphasis> * 2 )
end
</programlisting>
      </example>

      <para>The above rule in 4.0.x would be:</para>

      <example>
        <title>Drools 4.0.x primitive support</title>

        <programlisting>rule "Primitive support"
when
    $c : Cheese( $price : price )
then
    $c.setPrice( $price * 2 )
end
</programlisting>
      </example>

    <title>Drools Update Tool</title>

    <para>The Drools Update tools is a simple program to help with the upgrade
    of DRL files from Drools 3.0.x to Drools 4.0.x.</para>

    <para>At this point, its main objective is to upgrade the memory action
    calls from 3.0.x to 4.0.x, but expect it to grow over the next few weeks
    covering additional scenarios. It is important to note that it does not
    make a dumb text search and replace in rules file, but it actually parses
    the rules file and try to make sure it is not doing anything unexpected,
    and as so, it is a safe tool to use for upgrade large sets of rule
    files.</para>

    <para>The Drools update tool can be found as a maven project in the
    following source repository
    http://anonsvn.labs.jboss.com/labs/jbossrules/trunk/experimental/drools-update/
    you just need to check it out, and execute the maven clean install action
    with the project's pom.xml file. After resolve all the class path
    dependencies you are able to run the toll with the following
    command:</para>

    <programlisting>java -cp $CLASSPATH org.drools.tools.update.UpdateTool -f &lt;filemask&gt; [-d &lt;basedir&gt;] [-s &lt;sufix&gt;]</programlisting>

    <para>The program parameters are very easy to understand as following.</para>
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>-h,--help, Shows a very simple list the usage help</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>-d your source base directory</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>-f pattern for the files to be updated. The format is the same
          as used by ANT: * = single file, directory ** = any level of
          subdirectories EXAMPLE: src/main/resources/**/*.drl = matches all
          DRL files inside any subdirectory of /src/main/resources</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>-s,--sufix the sufix to be added to all updated files</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

    <title>DSL Grammars in Drools 4.0</title>

    <para>It is important to note that the DSL template engine was rewritten
    from scratch to improve flexibility. One of the new features of DSL
    grammars is the support to Regular Expressions. This way, now you can
    write your mappings using regexp to have additional flexibility, as
    explained in the DSL chapter. Although, now you have to escape characters
    with regexp meaning. Example: if previously you had a matching
    like:</para>

    <example>
      <title>Drools 3.0.x mapping</title>

      <programlisting>[when][]- the {attr} is in [ {values} ]={attr} in ( {values} )</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>Now, you need to escape '[' and ']' characters, as they have special
    meaning in regexps. So, the same mapping in Drools 4.0 would be:</para>

    <example>
      <title>Drools 4.0.x mapping with escaped characters</title>

      <programlisting>[when][]- the {attr} is in \[ {values} \]={attr} in ( {values} )</programlisting>
    </example>
