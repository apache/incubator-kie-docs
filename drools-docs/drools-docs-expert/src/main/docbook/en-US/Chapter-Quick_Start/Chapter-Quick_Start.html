        rule engine such as Drools that it becomes beguiling. Have no fear my intrepid adventurer,
        the complexity is layered and you can ease yourself into with simple use cases.</p><p>Stateless session, not utilising inference, forms the simplest of use case. A stateless
        session can be called like a function passing it some data and then receiving some results
        back. Some common use cases for stateless sessions are, but not limited to:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Validation</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="circle"><li><p>Is this person legible for a mortgage</p></li></ul></div></li><li><p>Calculation</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="circle"><li><p>Mortgage premium</p></li></ul></div></li><li><p>Routing/Filtering</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="circle"><li><p>Filtering incoming messages, such as emails, into folders</p></li><li><p>Sending incoming message to a destinatino</p></li></ul></div></li></ul></div><p>So lets start with a very simple example using a driving license application.</p><pre class="programlisting">public class Applicant {
    private String name;
    private int age;
    private boolean valid;
    // getter and setter methods here
}
</pre><p>Now we have our data model we can write our first rule, we assume the application starts
        off valid and rules would be used to disqualify the application. As this is a simple
        validation use case we will add a single rule to disqualify the applicant if they are
        younger than 18.</p><pre class="programlisting">package com.company.license

rule "Is of valid age"
when
    $a : Applicant( age &lt; 18 )
then
    $a.setValid( false );
end</pre><p>To make the engine aware of data, so it can be processed against the rules, we have to
        "insert" the data, much like with a database. When the Applicant instance is inserted into
        the engine it is evaluated against the constraints of the rules, in this case just two
        constraint for one rule. We say two because the type Applicant is the first object type
        constraint, and the "age &lt; 18" is the second field constraint. An object type constraint
        plus it's zero or more field constraints is referred to as a pattern. When an inserted
        instance satisfies both the object type constraint and all the field constraints, it is said
        to be matched. The "$a" is a binding and allows the matched object to be referenced in the
        consquence, so it's properties can be updated, the $ is optional, but it helps to
        differentiate the variables from the fields. This part of the engine is often referred to as
        pattern matchin, i.e. the matching of patterns against the inserted data.</p><p>Let's assume that the rules are in the same folder as the classes, so we can use the
        classpath resource loader to build our first KnowledgeBase. A KnowledgeBase is what we call
        our collection of compiled rules, which are compiled using the KnowledgeBuilder.</p><pre class="programlisting">KnowledgeBuilder kbuilder = KnowledgeBuilderFactory.newKnowledgeBuilder();
kbuilder.add( ResourceFactory.newClasspathResource( "licenseApplication.drl", getClass() ),
              ResourceType.DRL );
if ( kbuilder.hasErrors() ) {
    System.err.println( builder.getErrors().toString() );
}  </pre><p>The above looks on the classpath for the "licenseApplication.drl" file, using the given
        classes getResource() method. The ResourceType here is DRL, short for "Drools Rule
        Language". Once the drl has be added we can check the KnowledgeBuilder for any errors. If
        there are no errors, we are now ready to build our session and execute against some
        data:</p><pre class="programlisting">StatelessKnowledgeSession ksession = kbase.newStatelessKnowledgeSession();
Applicant applicant = new Applicant( "Mr John Smith", 16 );
assertTrue( applicant.isValid() );
ksession.execute( applicant );
assertFalse( applicant.isValid() );
</pre><p>The above executes the data against the rules, the applicant is under the age of 18, so
        it marked invalid.</p><p>So far we've only used a single instance, but what if want to use more than one? We can
        also execute against an Iterable, such a a collection. Lets add another class called
        Application, which has the date of the application and we'll move the boolean valid field to
        the Application class.</p><pre class="programlisting">public class Applicant {
    private String name;
    private int age;
    // getter and setter methods here
}


public class Application {
    private Date dateApplied;
    private boolean valid;
    // getter and setter methods here
}</pre><p>And we can also add another rule, that validates the Application was made within a
        period of time.</p><pre class="programlisting">package com.company.license

rule "Is of valid age"
when
    Applicant( age &lt; 18 )
    $a : Application()     
then
    $a.setValid( false );
end

rule "Application was made this year"
when
    $a : Application( dateApplied &gt; "01-jan-2009" )     
then
    $a.setValid( false );
end
</pre><p>Unfortunately in java an array does not implement h the Iterable interface, so we have
        to use the JDK converter, asList(...). So code below executes against an Iterable, where
        each of the collection elements are inserted before any matched rules are fired.</p><pre class="programlisting">StatelessKnowledgeSession ksession = kbase.newStatelessKnowledgeSession();
Applicant applicant = new Applicant( "Mr John Smith", 16 );
Application application = new Application();
assertTrue( application() );
ksession.execute( Arrays.asList( new Object[] { application, applicant } ) );
assertFalse( application() );
</pre><p>The two execute methods execute(Object object ) and execute(Iterable objects) are
        actually convenience methods for the interface BatchExecutor's method execute(Command
        command). This allows for more than just fact insertion, and also handles "out" parameters
        and results.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e73"></a>Stateful Knowledge Session</h3></div></div></div><p>Stateful sessions are longer lived and allow iterative changes over time. Some common
        use cases for stateful sessions are, but not limited to:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Monitoring</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="circle"><li><p>Stock market monitorig and analysis for semi-automatic buying.</p></li></ul></div></li><li><p>Diagnostics</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="circle"><li><p>fault finding, medical diagnostics</p></li></ul></div></li><li><p>Logistics</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="circle"><li><p>parcel tracking and delivery provisioning</p></li></ul></div></li><li><p>Compliance</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="circle"><li><p>Validation of legality for market trades.</p></li></ul></div></li></ul></div><p>We can use a fire alarm example to explore the monitoring use case. The simple example
        has just 4 classes. We are monitoring the rooms in a house, each room has one sprinkler. If
        a fire starts in a room, we represent that with a single Fire instance.</p><pre class="programlisting">public class Room {
    private String name
    // getter and setter methods here
}
public classs Sprinkler {
    private Room room;
    private boolean on;
    // getter and setter methods here
}
public class Fire {
    private room room;
    // getter and setter methods here
}
public class Alarm {
}
</pre><p>In the previous section on stateless sessions the concepts of inserting and matching
        against data was introduced. That example assumed only a single instance of each object type
        was ever inserted and thus only used literal constraints. However a house has many rooms, so
        rules have the need to express joins that constraint to the desired objects, this can be
        done using a binding as a variable constraint in a pattern. This join process results in
        what is called cross products, which are covered in the next section.</p><p>When a fire occurs an instance of the Fire class is created, for that room, and insert
        it. The rule uses a binding on the room field of the Fire to constrain to the Sprinkler for
        that room, which is currently off. When this rule fires and the consequence is executed the
        sprinkler is turned on</p><pre class="programlisting">rule "When there is a fire turn on the sprinkler"
when
    Fire($room : room)
    $sprinkler : Sprinkler( room == $room, on == false )
then
    modify( $sprinkler ) { setOn( true ) };
    System.out.println( "Turn off the sprinkler for room " + $room.getName() );
end</pre><p>Where as the stateless session used standard java syntax to modify a field, in the above
        rule we use the modify keyword, which acts as a sort of with statement, that contains a
        series of comma separated java expressions. Stateless sessions do not have inference, so the
        engine does not need to be aware of changes to data, however a stateful session does. The
        modify keyword allows the setters to modify the data, while make the engine aware of those
        changes so it can reason over them, this process is called inference.</p><p>So far we have rules that tell us when matching data exists, but what about when it
        doesn't exist? What about when there stops being a Fire? Previously the constraints have
        been propositional logic where the engine is constraining against individual intances,
        Drools also has support for first order logic that allows you to look at sets of data. The
        'not' keyword matches when something does not exist. So for a Room with a Sprinkler that is
        on when the Fire for that room stops existing we can turn off the sprinkler.</p><pre class="programlisting">rule "When the fire is gone turn on the sprinkler"
when
    $room : Room( )
    $sprinkler : Sprinkler( room == $room, on == true )
    not Fire( room == $room )
then
    modify( $sprinkler ) { setOn( false ) };
    System.out.println( "Turn off the sprinkler for room " + $room.getName() );
end</pre><p>While there is a Sprinkler per room, there is just a single Alarm for the building. An
        Alarm is created when a Fire is occurs, but only one Alarm is needed for the entire
        building, no matter how many Fires occur. Previously 'not' was introduced, the compliment to
        ths is 'exists' which matches for one or more of something.</p><pre class="programlisting">rule "Raise the alarm when we have one or more fires"
when
    exists Fire()
then
    insert( new Alarm() );
    System.out.println( "Raise the alarm" );
end</pre><p>Likewise when there are no Fires we want to remove the alarm, so the 'not' keyword can
        be used again.</p><pre class="programlisting">rule "Lower the alarm when all the fires have gone"
when
    not Fire()
    $alarm : Alarm()
then
    retract( $alarm );
    System.out.println( "Lower the alarm" );
end

</pre><p>Finally there is a general health status message, that is printed when the application
        first starts and after the Alarm is removed and all Sprinklers have been turned off.</p><pre class="programlisting">rule "Status output when things are ok"
when
    not Alarm()
    not Sprinkler( on === true ) 
then
    System.out.println( "Everything is ok" );
end</pre><p>The above rules should be placed in a single drl file and saved to the classpath using
        the file name "fireAlarm.drl", as per the stateless session example. We can then build a
        KnowledgeBase as before, just using the new name "fireAlarm.drl". The difference is this
        time we create a stateful session from the kbase, where as before we created a stateless
        session.</p><pre class="programlisting">KnowledgeBuilder kbuilder = KnowledgeBuilderFactory.newKnowledgeBuilder();
kbuilder.add( ResourceFactory.newClasspathResource( "fireAlarm.drl", getClass() ),
              ResourceType.DRL );
if ( kbuilder.hasErrors() ) {
    System.err.println( builder.getErrors().toString() );
}  
StatefulKnowledgeSession ksession = kbase.newStatefulKnowledgeSession();</pre><p>With the session created it is now possible to iteratvely work with it over time. Four
        Rooms are created and inserted, a Sprinkler for each room is also inserted. At this point
        the engine has done all it's matching, but no rules have fired. calling "fireAllRules" on
        the ksession allows the matched rules to fire, currently that is just the health
        message.</p><pre class="programlisting">Room kitchen = new Room( "kitchen" );
Room bedroom = new Room( "bedroom" );
Room office = new Room( "office" );
Room livingRoom = new Room( "livingroom" );

ksession.insert( kitchen );
ksession.insert( bedroom );
ksession.insert( office );
ksession.insert( livingRoom );

Sprinkler kitchenSprinkler = new Sprinkler( kitchen );
Sprinkler bedroomSprinkler = new Sprinkler( bedroom );
Sprinkler officeSprinkler = new Sprinkler( office );
Sprinkler livingRoomSprinkler = new Sprinkler( livingRoom );


ksession.insert( kitchenSprinkler );
ksession.insert( bedroomSprinkler );
ksession.insert( officeSprinkler );
ksession.insert( livingRoomSprinkler );

ksession.fireAllRules()
</pre><pre class="programlisting">&gt; Everything is ok</pre><p>We now create two fires and insert them, this time a referenced is kept for the returned
        FactHandle. The FactHandle is an internal engine reference to the inserted instance and
        allows that instance to be retracted or modified at a later point in time. With the Fires
        now in the engine, once "fireAllRules" is called, the Alarm is raised and the respectively
        Sprinklers are turned on.</p><pre class="programlisting">Fire kitchenFire = new Fire( kitchen );
Fire officeFire = new Fire( office );

FactHandle kitchenFireHandle = kession.insert( kitchenFire );

ksession.fireAllRules();</pre><pre class="programlisting">&gt; Raise the alarm
&gt; Turn on the sprinkler for room kitchen
&gt; Turn on the sprinkler for room office</pre><p>After a while the fires will be put out and the Fire intances are retracted. This
        results in the Sprinklers being turned off, the Alarm being lowered and eventually the
        health message is printed again.</p><pre class="programlisting">ksession.retract( kitchenFire );
ksession.retract( officeFire );

ksession.fireAllRules();</pre><pre class="programlisting">&gt; Turn on the sprinkler for room office

        the value and power of a declarative rule system.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e159"></a>A Little Theory</h2></div></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e162"></a>Methods versus Rules</h3></div></div></div><p>People often confuse methods and rules, and new rule users regular ask, "how do I call a

        that is obvsious, but just to summarise.</p><pre class="programlisting">public void helloWorld(Person person) {
    if ( person.getName().equals( &#8220;Chuck&#8221; ) ) {

Imagine
        for a moment when using the previous data the following rules where used, with no field
        constraints:</p><pre class="programlisting">rule
when
    $room : Room()
    $sprinkler : Sprinkler()
then
    System.out.println( "room:" + $room.getName() + " sprinkler:" + $sprinkler.getRoom().getName() );
end</pre><p>In SQL terms this would be like doing "select * from Room, Sprinkler" and every row in
        the Room table would be joined with every row in the Sprinkler table resulting in the
        following output:</p><pre class="programlisting">room:office sprinker:office
room:office sprinker:kitchen
room:office sprinker:livingroom
room:office sprinker:bedroom
room:kitchen sprinker:office

room:livingroom sprinker:livingroom
room:livingroom sprinker:bedroom
room:bedroom sprinker:office
room:bedroom sprinker:kitchen
room:bedroom sprinker:livingroom
room:bedroom sprinker:bedroom</pre><p>These cross products can obviously become huge as well as returning potentially
        incorrect data. The size of cross products is often source of performance problems for new
        rule authors. From this it can be seen that it's always desirable to constrain the cross
        products, which is done with the variable constriant.</p><pre class="programlisting">rule

    $sprinkler : Sprinkler( room == $room )
then
    System.out.println( "room:" + $room.getName() + " sprinkler:" + $sprinkler.getRoom().getName() );
end</pre><p>Resulting in just for rows of data, with the correct Sprinkler for the Room. In SQL
        (actually HQL) terms that is like "select * from Room, Sprinkler where Room ==

        When there is one or more Activations on the Agenda they are said to be in conflict, and a
        conflict resolver strategy is used to determine the order of execution. At the simplest
        level the default strategy uses salience to determine rule priority. Each rule has a default
        value of 0, the higher the value the higher the priority. To illustrate this a rule to print
        the Account balance can be added, we want this rule to be executed after all the debit's and
        credit's have been applied for this rule, by setting the rule to have a salience of below 0
        we ensure it fires afterwards.</p><table border="0px" id="d0e682"><tbody><tr>
