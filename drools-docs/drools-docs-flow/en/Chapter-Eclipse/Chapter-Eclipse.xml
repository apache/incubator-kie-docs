  <title>Drools Eclipse IDE features</title>

  <para>The Drools plugin for the Eclipse IDE provides a few additional features that
  might be interesting for developers.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Process skins</title>

    <para>We have introduced the concept of a (process) skin, which controls how the
    different nodes inside a process are visualized. This allows you to change the 
    visualization of the different node types the way you like them (by implementing
    your own SkinProvider).</para>

    <para>BPMN is a popular language used by business users for modeling business
    processes. BPMN defines terminology, different types of nodes, how these should
    be visualized, etc. People who are familiar with BPMN might find it easier to
    implement an executable process (possibly based on a BPMN process diagram) using
    a similar visualization. We have therefore created a BPMN skin that maps the Drools
    Flow concepts to the equivalent BPMN visualization.</para>

    <para>For example, the following figure shows a process using some of the different
    types of nodes in the RuleFlow language using the default skin ...</para>

      <imageobject>
	      <imagedata align="center" fileref="RuleFlow.png" format="PNG" role="" />
      </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>

    <para>Simply by switching the preferred process skin in the Drools preferences ...</para>

    <mediaobject>
      <imageobject>
	      <imagedata align="center" fileref="preferences.png" format="PNG" role="" />
      </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>

    <para>and then reopening the editor shows the same process using the BPMN skin ...</para>

    <mediaobject>
      <imageobject>
	      <imagedata align="center" fileref="BPMN.png" format="PNG" role="" />
      </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>
