  <title>Introduction</title>
  <para>Drools Flow is a workflow or process engine that allows
  advanced integration of processes and rules.  A process or a
  workflow describes the order in which a series of steps need
  to be executed, using a flow chart.  For example, the following
  figure shows a process where first Task1 and Task2 need to be
  executed in parallel.  After completion of both, Task3 needs to
  be executed.</para>

  <para>The following chapters will teach you everything you need
  to know about Drools Flow.  Its distinguishing characteristics
  are:
    <orderedlist>
      <listitem><emphasis role="strong">Advanced integration of processes
      and rules:</emphasis> Processes and rules are usually considered as
      two different paradigms when it comes to defining business logic.
      While loose coupling between a processes and rules is possible by
      integrating both a process and a rules engine, we provide advanced
      integration of processes and rules out-of-the-box.  This allows
      users to use rules to define part of their business logic when
      defining their business processes and vice versa.</listitem>
      <listitem><emphasis role="strong">Unification of processes and
      rules:</emphasis> We consider rules, processes and event processing
      all as different types of knowledge.  Not only do we allow the advanced
      integration of these three types, we also offer a unified API and
      unified tooling so that users should not have to learn three different products
      but can easily combine these three types using our knowledge-based API.
      The tooling also allows seamless integration of these different kinds of
      knowledge, including things like a unified knowledge repository, audit
      logs, debugging, etc.</listitem>
      <listitem><emphasis role="strong">Declarative modelling:</emphasis>
      Drools Flow tries to keep processes as declarative as possible, i.e.,
      focussing on what should happen instead of how.  As a result, we try
      to avoid having to hardcode details into your process but offer ways
      to describe your work in an abstract way (e.g., by using pluggable work
      items, a business scripting language, etc.). We also allow users
      to easily create domain-specific extensions, making it much simpler to
      read, update or create these processes as they are using
      domain-specific concepts that are closely related to the problem at
      hand and can be understood by domain experts.</listitem>
      <listitem><emphasis role="strong">Generic process engine supporting
      multiple process languages:</emphasis> We do not believe that there
      is one process language that fits all purposes.  Therefore, the Drools
      Flow engine is based on a generic process engine that allows the
      definition and execution of different types of process languages, like
      for example our RuleFlow language, WS-BPEL (a standard targeted towards
      web service orchestration), OSWorkflow (another existing workflow
      language), jPDL (the process language defined by the jBPM project), etc.
      All these languages are based on the same set of core building blocks,
      making it easier to implement your own process language by reusing and
      combining these low-level building blocks the way you want to.</listitem>
    </orderedlist>
  All these features (and many more) will be explained in the following
  chapters.
