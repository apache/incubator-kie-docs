    <para>Drools Server is a war file, which can be deployed in a application
    server (such as JBoss AS). As the service is stateless, it is possible to
    have have as many of these services deployed as you need to serve the
    client load. Deploy on JBoss AS 4.x / Tomcat 6.x works out-of-the-box,
    instead the configuration must be changed to be deployed in JBoss AS
