          <para>As part of your download, you should have an examples
          directory - in the drools-examples-brms director. Under that there
          will be an "advertising example" and a "mortage example" - in both
          cases there is an XML file you can import into the repository (it
          will replace any content in your current repository - be aware). In
          the case of the mortage example, it has some notes on how to "use"
          it (from the client side) - in all cases you should be able to run
          the scenarios (in some cases some "failures" are deliberate left in
          as an example of how you test it - play around !). </para>
