    <title>What is a BRMS?</title>

    <para>BRMS stands for Business Rules Management System.</para>

    <para>A BRMS allows people to manage rules in a multi user environment, it
    is a single point of truth for your business rules, allowing change in a
    controlled fashion, with user friendly interfaces.</para>

    <para>Guvnor is the name of the web and network related components for
    managing rules with drools. This combined with the core drools engine and
    other tools forms "a BRMS". </para>

    <section>
      <title>When to use Guvnor</title>

      <para>You should consider Guvnor if any of the following apply to you:
      You need to manage versions/deployment of rules, you need to let
      multiple users of different skill levels access and edit rules, you
      don't have any existing infrastructure to manage rules, you have lots of
      "business" rules (as opposed to technical rules as part of an
      application).</para>

      <para>Guvnor can be used on its own, or with the IDE tooling (often both
      together).</para>

      <para>Guvnor can be "branded" and made part of your application, or it
      can be a central rule repository.</para>

      <section>
        <title>When to not use Guvnor</title>

        <para>In some situations applications may exist which have the rules
        in a database (for instance as part of an existing application), and
        no new application is needed to manage the rules.</para>

        <para>In this case, the drools-template library is worth a look - you
        can define templates for rules to be generated from any tablular data
        source.</para>

        <para>Otherwise, perhaps an existing rule management system and user
        interface already exists (and is tailored to your environment already)
        - in this case migrating to Guvnor may not be necessary.</para>

        <para>If you are using rules to solve complex algorithmic problems,
        and the rules are essentially an integral part of the application (and
        don't need to be managed separately to the code).</para>

    <section>
      <title>Who uses Guvnor</title>

      <para>The main roles of people who would use a BRMS are: Business
      Analyst, Rule expert, Developer, Administrators (rule administrators
      etc).</para>

      <para>Guvnor is designed in such a way as these different roles can be
      accommodated, it can be controlled how much is exposed to different
      users in a safe fashion.</para>
