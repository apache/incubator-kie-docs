  <title>Session Clock</title>

  <para>Reasoning over time requires a reference clock. Just to mention one
  example, if a rule reasons over the average price of a given stock over the
  last 60 minutes, how the engine knows what stock price changes happened over
  the last 60 minutes in order to calculate the average? The obvious response
  is: by comparing the timestamp of the events with the "current time". How
  the engine knows what <emphasis role="bold">time is now</emphasis>? Again,
  obviously, by querying the Session Clock.</para>

  <para>The session clock implements a strategy pattern, allowing different
  types of clocks to be plugged and used by the engine. This is very important
  because the engine may be running in an array of different scenarios that
  may require different clock implementations. Just to mention a few:</para>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Rules testing:</emphasis> testing always
      requires a controled environment, and when the tests include rules with
      temporal constraints, it is necessary to not only control the input
      rules and facts, but also the flow of time.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Regular execution:</emphasis> usually, when
      running rules in production, the application will require a real time
      clock that allows the rules engine to react immediately to the time
      progression.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Special environments:</emphasis> specific
      environments may have specific requirements on time control. Cluster
      environments may require clock synchronization through heart beats, or
      JEE environments may require the use of an AppServer provided clock,
      etc.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Rules replay or simulation: </emphasis>to
      replay scenarios or simulate scenarios it is necessary that the
      application also controls the flow of time.</para>
    </listitem>
