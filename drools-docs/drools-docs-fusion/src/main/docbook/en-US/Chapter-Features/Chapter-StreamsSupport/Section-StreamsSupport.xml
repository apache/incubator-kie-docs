  <title>Streams Support</title>

  <para>Most CEP use cases have to deal with streams of events. The streams
  can be provided to the application in various forms, from JMS queues to flat
  text files, from database tables to raw sockets or even through web service
  calls. In any case, the streams share a common set of
  characteristics:</para>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>events in the stream are ordered by a timestamp. The timestamp may
      have different semantics for different streams but they are always
      ordered internally.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>volumes of events are usually high.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>atomic events are rarely useful by themselves. Usually meaning is
      extracted from the correlation between multiple events from the stream
      and also from other sources.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>streams may be homogeneous, i.e. contain a single type of events,
      or heterogeneous, i.e. contain multiple types of events.</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>Drools generalized the concept of a stream as an "entry point" into
  the engine. An entry point is for drools a gate from which facts come. The
  facts may be regular facts or special facts like events.</para>

  <para>In Drools, facts from one entry point (stream) may join with facts
  from any other entry point or event with facts from the working memory.
  Although, they never mix, i.e., they never lose the reference to the entry
  point through which they entered the engine. This is important because one
  may have the same type of facts coming into the engine through several entry
  points, but one fact that is inserted into the engine through entry point A
  will never match a pattern from a entry point B, for example.</para>
