      <para>Fernando runs a dodgy fly by night insurance operation in Sao
      Paulo, Brasil. These are his rules - would you buy insurance from him ?
      (I wouldn't).</para>

      <para>This example takes you through the key steps in using the BRMS
      with an example repository, and using rules in a very very simple
      application (which you can use as a basis for your applications).</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Download the latest version of BRMS from
          http://cruisecontrol.jboss.com/cc/artifacts/jboss-rules</para>

          <para>Deploy BRMS WAR file into JBoss4.2 AS or JBossWeb, other
          containers can be used as well (possibly with some tweaking of
          dependencies).</para>

          <para>Check you can access and run the BRMS.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Check out the demo project from the Drools subversion
          repository (this will be included in future distributions):</para>

          <para>http://anonsvn.labs.jboss.com/labs/jbossrules/trunk/drools-examples/drools-examples-brms/</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Import the demo business rules insurance repository file into
          BRMS, the compressed can be found at "files" folder in the demo
          project.</para>

          <para>To do this, open the "files" directory, unzip the file there
          locally, and then go to the "Admin" section and "Manage backups" of
          the BRMS, select the file, and press "Import" - follow
          instructions.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Navigate through the BRMS web application to see how things
          are placed and organized and try to create some rules.</para>

          <para>Go to the "Packages" feature and build the package (you should
          see no errors).</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Now go to the "Deployment" feature, when you click on the
          package, it will show you one snapshot (which was part of the
          import, you can create more if you like from the previous
          step).</para>

          <para>Open a snapshot.</para>

          <para>Copy the snapshot url that is displayed.</para>

          <para>Locate the file brmsdeployedrules.properties</para>

          <para>Place the copied URL in the brmsdeployedrules.properties
          file.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>OPTIONAL: To use a file or directory deployment in the rule
          agent just update brmsdeployedrules.properties according the
          documentation.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Import the example project into eclipse and execute the
          MainClass. The program will show the following trace (and away you
          go !).</para>
