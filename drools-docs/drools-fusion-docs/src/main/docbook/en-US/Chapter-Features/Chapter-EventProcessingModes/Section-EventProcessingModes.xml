  <title>Event Processing Modes</title>

  <para>Rules engines in general have a well known way of processing data and
  rules and provide the application with the results. Also, there is not many
  requirements on how facts should be presented to the rules engine, specially
  because in general, the processing itself is time independent. That is a
  good assumption for most scenarios, but not for all of them. When the
  requirements include the processing of real time or near real time events,
  time becomes and important variable of the reasoning process.</para>

  <para>The following sections will explain the impact of time on rules
  reasoning and the two modes provided by Drools for the reasoning process.
