  <title>Cloud Mode</title>

  <para>The CLOUD processing mode is the default processing mode. Users of
  rules engine are familiar with this mode because it behaves in exactly the
  same way as any pure forward chaining rules engine, including previous
  versions of Drools.</para>

  <para>When running in CLOUD mode, the engine sees all facts in the working
  memory, does not matter if they are regular facts or events, as a whole.
  There is no notion of flow of time, although events have a timestamp as
  usual. In other words, although the engine knows that a given event was
  created, for instance, on January 1st 2009, at 09:35:40.767, it is not
  possible for the engine to determine how "old" the event is, because there
  is no concept of "now".</para>

  <para>In this mode, the engine will apply its usual many-to-many pattern
  matching algorithm, using the rules constraints to find the matching tuples,
  activate and fire rules as usual.</para>

  <para>This mode does not impose any kind of additional requirements on
  facts. So for instance:</para>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>There is no notion of time. No requirements clock synchronization.
      </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>There is no requirement on event ordering. The engine looks at the
      events as an unordered cloud against which the engine tries to match
      rules.</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>On the other hand, since there is no requirements, some benefits are
  not available either. For instance, in CLOUD mode, it is not possible to use
  sliding windows, because sliding windows are based on the concept of "now"
  and there is no concept of "now" in CLOUD mode. </para>

  <para>Since there is no ordering requirement on events, it is not possible
  for the engine to determine when events can no longer match and as so, there
  is no automatic life-cycle management for events. I.e., the application must
  explicitly retract events when they are no longer necessary, in the same way
  the application does with regular facts.</para>

  <para>Cloud mode is the default execution mode for Drools, but in any case,
  as any other configuration in Drools, it is possible to change this behavior
  either by setting a system property, using configuration property files or
  using the API. The corresponding property is:</para>

  <programlisting language="java">KnowledgeBaseConfiguration config = KnowledgeBaseFactory.newKnowledgeBaseConfiguration();
config.setOption( EventProcessingOption.CLOUD );</programlisting>

  <para>The equivalent property is:</para>

  <programlisting>drools.eventProcessingMode = cloud</programlisting>

  <para></para>
