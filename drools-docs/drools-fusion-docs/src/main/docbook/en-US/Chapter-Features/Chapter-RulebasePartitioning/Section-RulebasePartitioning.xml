  <title>Knowledgebase Partitioning</title>

  <warning>
    <para>This is an experimental feature, subject to changes in the
    future.</para>
  </warning>

  <para>The classic Rete algorithm is usually executed using a single thread.
  Although, as confirmed in several opportunities by Dr. Forgy, the algorithm
  itself is parallelizable. Drools implementation of the ReteOO algorithm
  supports coarse grained parallelization through rulebase
  partitioning.</para>

  <para>When this option is enabled, the rulebase will be partitioned in
  several independent partitions and a pool of worker threads will be used to
  propagate facts through the partitions. The implementation guarantees that
  at most one worker thread will be executing tasks for a given partition, but
  multiple partitions may be "active" at a single point in time.</para>

  <para>Everything should be transparent to the user, except that all working
  memory actions (insert/retract/modify) are executed assynchronously.</para>

  <important>
    <para>This feature enables parallel LHS evaluation, but does not change
    the behavior of rule firing. I.e., rules will continue to fire
    sequentially, according to the conflict resolution strategy.</para>
