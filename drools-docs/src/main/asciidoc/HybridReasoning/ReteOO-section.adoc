= ReteOO Algorithm


The _ReteOO_ was developed throughout the 3, 4 and 5 series releases.
It takes the RETE algorithm and applies well known enhancements, all of which are covered by existing academic literature:

Node sharing

* Sharing is applied to both the alpha and beta network. The beta network sharing is always from the root pattern.

Alpha indexing

* Alpha Nodes with many children use a hash lookup mechanism to avoid testing each result.

Beta indexing

* Join, Not and Exist nodes index their memories using a hash. This reduces the join attempts for equal checks. Recently range indexing was added to Not and Exists.

Tree based graphs

* Join matches did not contain any references to their parent or children matches. Deletions would have to recalculate all join matches again, which involves recreating all those join match objects, to be able to find the parts of the network where the tuples should be deleted. This is called symmetrical propagation. A tree graph provides parent and children references, so a deletion is just a matter of following those references. This is asymmetrical propagation. The result is faster and makes less impact on the GC. It is also more robust because changes in values will not cause memory leaks if they happen without the engine being notified.

Modify-in-place

* Traditional RETE implements a modify as a delete + insert. This causes all join tuples to be GC'd, many of which are recreated again as part of the insert. Modify-in-place instead propagates as a single pass; every node is inspected. 

Property reactive

* Also called "new trigger condition". Allows more fine grained reactivity to updates. A Pattern can react to changes to specific properties and ignore others. This alleviates problems of recursion and also helps with performance.

Sub-networks

* Not, Exists and Accumulate can each have nested conditional elements, which forms sub networks.

Backward Chaining

* Prolog style derivation trees for backward chaining are supported. The implementation is stack based, so does not have method recursion issues for large graphs.

Lazy Truth Maintenance

* Truth maintenance has a runtime cost which is incurred whether TMS is used or not. Lazy TMS enables it only on first use; further it is activated per object type, so irrelevant object types do not incur the runtime cost.

Heap based agenda

* The agenda uses a binary heap queue to sort rule matches by salience, rather than any linear search or maintenance approach.

Dynamic Rules

* Rules can be added and removed at runtime, while the engine is still populated with data.
