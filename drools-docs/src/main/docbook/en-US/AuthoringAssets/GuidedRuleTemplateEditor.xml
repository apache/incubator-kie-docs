  <title>Templates of assets/rules</title>

  <para>The guided rule editor is great when you need to define a single rule,
  however if you need to define multiple rules following the same structure
  but with different values in field constraints or action sections a "Rule
  Template" is a valuable asset. Rule templates allow the user to define a
  rule structure with place-holders for values that are to be interpolated
  from a table of data. Literal values, formulae and expressions can also
  continue to be used.</para>

  <para>Rule Templates can often be used as an alternative for Decision Tables
    in Drools Workbench.</para>

  <section xml:id="drools.GuidedRuleTemplateEditorCreating">
    <title>Creating a rule template</title>

    <para>To create a template for a rule simply select the "Guided Rule
    Template" from the "New Item" menu.</para>
  </section>

  <section xml:id="drools.GuidedRuleTemplateEditorDefining">
    <title>Define the template</title>

    <para>Once a rule template has been created the editor is displayed. The
    editor takes the form of the standard guided editor explained in more
    detail under the "Rule Authoring" section. As the rule is constructed you
    are given the ability to insert "Template Keys" as place-holders within
    your field constraints and action sections. Literal values, formulae and
    expressions can continue to be used as in the standard guided
    editor.</para>

    <para>The following screenshot illustrates a simple rule that has been
    defined with a "Template Key" for the applicants' maximum age, minimum age
    and credit rating. The template keys have been defined as "$max_age",
    "$min_age" and "$cr" respectively.</para>

  <section xml:id="drools.GuidedRuleTemplateEditorDefiningData">
    <title>Defining the template data</title>

    <para>When you have completed the definition of your rule template you
    need to enter the data that will be used to interpolate the "Template Key"
    place-holders. Drools Workbench provides the facility to enter data in a
    flexible grid within the guided editor screen. The data entry section is located on the Data tab within the editor.</para>

    <para>The rule template data grid is very flexible; with different pop-up
    editors for the underlying fields' data-types. Columns can be resized and
    sorted; and cells can be merged and grouped to facilitate rapid data
    entry.</para>

    <para>One row of data interpolates the "Template Key" place-holders for a
    single rule; thus one row becomes one rule.</para>

    <note>
      <para>If any cells for a row are left blank a rule for the applicable
      row is not generated.</para>
    </note>

    <section xml:id="drools.GuidedRuleTemplateEditorCellMerging">
      <title>Cell merging</title>

      <para>The icon in the top left of the grid toggles cell merging on and
      off. When cells are merged those in the same column with identical
      values are merged into a single cell. This simplifies changing the value
      of multiple cells that shared the same original value. When cells are
      merged they also gain an icon in the top-left of the cell that allows
      rows spanning the merged cell to be grouped.</para>

    <section xml:id="drools.GuidedRuleTemplateEditorCellGrouping">
      <title>Cell grouping</title>

      <para>Cells that have been merged can be further collapsed into a single
      row. Clicking the [+\-] icon in the top left of a merged cell collapses
      the corresponding rows into a single entry. Cells in other columns
      spanning the collapsed rows that have identical values are shown
      unchanged. Cells in other columns spanning the collapsed rows that have
      different values are highlighted and the first value displayed.</para>

      <para>When the value of a grouped cell is altered all cells that have
      been collapsed also have their values updated.</para>

  <section xml:id="drools.GuidedRuleTemplateEditorGeneratedDRL">
    <title>Generated DRL</title>

    <para>Whilst not necessary, rule authors can view the DRL that will be generated for a "Rule Template" and
      associated data. This feature and its operation is no different to that for other assets. Select the "Source" tab
      from the bottom of the editor screen. The DRL for all rules will be displayed.</para>
