  <title>Technical rules (DRL)</title>

  <para>Technical (DRL) rules are stored as text - they can be managed in Drools Workbench. 
    A DRL can either be a whole chunk of rules, or an individual rule.
  if its an individual rule, no package statement or imports are required (in
  fact, you can skip the "rule" statement altogether, just use "when" and
  "then" to mark the condition and action sections respectively). Normally you
  would use the IDE to edit raw DRL files, since it has all the advanced
  tooling and content assistance and debugging. However, there are times when
  a rule may have to deal with something fairly technical in a package in
  Drools Workbench. In any typical package of rules, you generally have a need for some
  "technical rules" - you can mix and match all the rule types together of
  course.</para>
