  <title>Declarative Agenda</title>

  <warning>
    <para>Declarative Agenda is experimental, and all aspects are highly likely to change in the future.
      @Eager and @Direct are temporary annotations to control the behaviour of rules, which will also
      change as Declarative Agenda evolves. Annotations instead of attributes where chosen, to reflect
      their experimental nature.</para>
  </warning>

  <para>The declarative agenda allows to use rules to control which other rules can fire and when.
    While this will add a lot more overhead than the simple use of salience, the advantage is it is declarative and
    thus more readable and maintainable and should allow more use cases to be achieved in a simpler fashion.</para>

  <para>This feature is off by default and must be explicitly enabled, that is because it is considered highly
    experimental for the moment and will be subject to change, but can be activated on a given KieBase by adding the
    declarativeAgenda='enabled' attribute in the corresponding kbase tag of the kmodule.xml file as in the following example.
  </para>

  <example>
    <title>Enabling the Declarative Agenda</title>

    <programlisting language="xml">&lt;kmodule xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
      xmlns="http://www.drools.org/xsd/kmodule"&gt;
      &lt;kbase name="DeclarativeKBase" declarativeAgenda="enabled"&gt;
      &lt;ksession name="KSession"&gt;
      &lt;/kbase&gt;
      &lt;/kmodule&gt;</programlisting>
  </example>

  <para>The basic idea is:</para>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>All rule's Matches are inserted into WorkingMemory as facts. So you can now do pattern matching against a
        Match. The rule's metadata and declarations are available as fields on the Match object.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>You can use the kcontext.blockMatch( Match match ) for the current rule to block the selected
        match. Only when that rule becomes false will the match be eligible for firing. If it is already
        eligible for firing and is later blocked, it will be removed from the agenda until it is unblocked.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>A match may have multiple blockers and a count is kept. All blockers must became false for the
        counter to reach zero to enable the Match to be eligible for firing.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>kcontext.unblockAllMatches( Match match ) is an over-ride rule that will remove all blockers
        regardless</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>An activation may also be cancelled, so it never fires with cancelMatch</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>An unblocked Match is added to the Agenda and obeys normal salience, agenda groups, ruleflow groups
        etc.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>The @Direct annotations allows a rule to fire as soon as it's matched, this is to be used for
        rules that block/unblock matches, it is not desirable for these rules to have side effects that impact
        else where.</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <example>
    <title>New RuleContext methods</title>

    <programlisting>void blockMatch(Match match);
      void unblockAllMatches(Match match);
      void cancelMatch(Match match);</programlisting>
  </example>

  <para>Here is a basic example that will block all matches from rules that have metadata @department('sales').
    They will stay blocked until the blockerAllSalesRules rule becomes false, i.e. "go2" is retracted.</para>

  <example>
    <title>Block rules based on rule metadata</title>

    <programlisting>rule rule1 @Eager @department('sales') when
      $s : String( this == 'go1' )
      then
      list.add( kcontext.rule.name + ':' + $s );
      end
      rule rule2 @Eager @department('sales') when
      $s : String( this == 'go1' )
      then
      list.add( kcontext.rule.name + ':' + $s );
      end
      rule blockerAllSalesRules @Direct @Eager when
      $s : String( this == 'go2' )
      $i : Match( department == 'sales' )
      then
      list.add( $i.rule.name + ':' + $s  );
      kcontext.blockMatch( $i );
      end</programlisting>
  </example>

  <warning>
    <para>Further than annotate the blocking rule with @Direct, it is also necessary to annotate all the rules that
      could be potentially blocked by it with @Eager. This is because, since the Match has to be evaluated by
      the pattern matching of the blocking rule, the potentially blocked ones cannot be evaluated lazily, otherwise
      won't be any Match to be evaluated.</para>
  </warning>

  <para>This example shows how you can use active property to count the number of active or inactive (already fired)
    matches.</para>

  <example>
    <title>Count the number of active/inactive Matches</title>

    <programlisting>rule rule1 @Eager @department('sales') when
      $s : String( this == 'go1' )
      then
      list.add( kcontext.rule.name + ':' + $s );
      end
      rule rule2 @Eager @department('sales') when
      $s : String( this == 'go1' )
      then
      list.add( kcontext.rule.name + ':' + $s );
      end
      rule rule3 @Eager @department('sales') when
      $s : String( this == 'go1' )
      then
      list.add( kcontext.rule.name + ':' + $s );
      end
      rule countActivateInActive @Direct @Eager when
      $s : String( this == 'go2' )
      $active : Number( this == 1 ) from accumulate( $a : Match( department == 'sales', active == true ), count( $a ) )
      $inActive : Number( this == 2 ) from  accumulate( $a : Match( department == 'sales', active == false ), count( $a ) )
      then
      kcontext.halt( );
      end </programlisting>
  </example>
