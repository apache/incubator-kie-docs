// Purpose statement for the assembly
As a business analyst or business rules developer, you can use test scenarios in {CENTRAL} to test a decision service before a project is deployed. Testing a decision service ensures that rule assets in the project function properly and as expected. You can test a decision service at any time during project development.

.Prerequisites
* The team and project for the decision service have been created in {CENTRAL}. For details, see {URL_GETTING_STARTED_DECISION_SERVICE}[_{GETTING_STARTED_DECISION_SERVICE}_].
* Business rules and their associated data objects have been defined for the decision service. For example, see {URL_GUIDED_DECISION_TABLES}[_{GUIDED_DECISION_TABLES}_].

NOTE: Having defined business rules is not a technical prerequisite for test scenarios, because the scenarios can test the defined data that constitutes the business rules. However, creating the rules first is helpful so that you can also test entire rules in test scenarios and so that the scenarios more closely match the intended decision service.
