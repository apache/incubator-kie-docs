= Business rules and guided decision tables

As a business analyst or business rules developer, you can define rules and add conditions in a wizard-led tabular format. These rules and conditions are compiled in to Drools Rule Language (DRL) and form the core of the decision service for your project.

A decision table is a visual representation of one or more rules in a tabular format. Each rule consists of a single row in the table, and includes columns that define the conditions and outcome for that particular row.  The definition of each derives the outcome using the values of the conditions.
