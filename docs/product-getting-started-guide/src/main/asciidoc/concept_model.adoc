{PRODUCT} enables you to automate your business processes and decisions. Consider the process of translation as an example:

This process spans multiple departments, multiple people, and requires collaboration. {PRODUCT} enables you to make the communication between all relevant parties automated and more efficient. When a document is rejected, relevant parties are automatically notified. When a translated document needs revision, the translator is automatically notified as well. Experts can focus on their areas of expertise without worrying about effective communication, lost emails, or similar.

Business processes frequently change, which is why {PRODUCT} processes are easy to change and maintain by business analyst with the expertise of the business domain. When a new review needs to be introduced, or a new department added to the process, business analysts find it easy to modify the process workflow. Similarly, when a business introduces a new product, {PRODUCT} makes it easy to create a new process.

{PRODUCT} enables you to automate your business decisions. Consider the process of calculating shipping costs as an example:

* Shipping costs change with the size of the package, country, loyalty level, and the content of the package.
* Shipping is free when the customer's order is above a set amount of money.
* Shipping is free when it is customer's birthday.
* Codes can be applied for free shipping during sales, but such codes do not apply to shipping costs.

All of the decisions can be automated as well as easily maintained. {PRODUCT} enables business analysts to create and maintain thousands of rules either in a spreadsheet editor, or in the {PRODUCT} authoring environment.
