= Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio

Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio is the JBoss Integrated Development Environment (IDE) based on Eclipse. Get the latest Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio from the https://access.redhat.com/downloads/[DOWNLOADS] section of the Red Hat Customer Portal. Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio provides plug-ins with tools and interfaces for Red Hat JBoss BRMS and Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite. These plugins are based on the community version of these products. The Red Hat JBoss BRMS plug-in is called the Drools plug-in and the Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite plug-in is called the jBPM plug-in.

See the _Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio_ documentation for the Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio installation and setup instructions.

WARNING: Because of an issue in the way multi-byte rule names are handled, you must ensure that the instance of Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio is started with the file encoding set to UTF-8. You can do this by editing the `$_JBDS_HOME_/studio/jbdevstudio.ini` file and adding the following property: `"-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8"`.

[[_jboss_central]]
== JBoss Central

When you first start the Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio, JBoss Central is displayed in the main window of the workbench. From JBoss Central, it is possible to create new projects by selecting the menu options under *Start from scratch*. Example projects can be started by selecting the links under *Start from a sample*.

[NOTE]
====
Due to issues in GWT3, Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio should be configured to not use it. You can do this by setting the system property to `0`:

== Importing Projects from Git Repository into Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio

NOTE: This is an additional feature not required for working with Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio.

You can configure Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio to connect to a central Git asset repository. The repository stores rules, models, functions, and processes.

You can either clone a remote Git repository or import a local Git repository.

.Procedure: Cloning Remote Git Repository
. Start the {PRODUCT} server by selecting the server from the *Server* tab and clicking the start icon.
. Start the Secure Shell server, if not running already, by using the following command. The command is specific to Linux and Mac environments. If `sshd` has already been started, this command fails. In that case, you may safely ignore this step.
