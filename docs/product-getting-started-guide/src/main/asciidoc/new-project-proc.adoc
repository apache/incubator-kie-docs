= Creating the Mortgage Application project

A project consists of data models, business processes, business rules, and forms that are specific to your project's requirements. When you create a project in {CENTRAL} it is added to the Git repository connected to {CENTRAL}.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The business process application example includes features that are Technology Preview only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs), might not be functionally complete, and Red Hat does not recommend to use them for production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.
For more information on Red Hat Technology Preview features support scope, see https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/.
