= Test Scenarios

Test Scenarios in {PRODUCT} enable you to validate the functionality of rules, models, and events before deploying them into production. A test scenario uses data for conditions that resemble an instance of your fact or project model. This data is matched against a given set of rules and if the expected results match the actual results, the test is successful. If the expected results do not match the actual results, then the test fails.

After you run all test scenarios, the status of the scenarios is reported in a *Reporting* panel.

Test scenarios can be executed one at the time or as a group. The group execution contains all the scenarios from one package. Test scenarios are independent, so that one scenario cannot affect or modify the other.
