== Creating Repository Structure

All business assets are located in repositories, which are associated with organizational units. The artifact repository does not contain any organizational unit by default. To create business assets, such as a business process, first create an organizational unit and a Git repository. 

The repository contains projects. A project can contain an arbitrary package structure, which enables you to structure its content into a directory-like structure. Any package can contain your business assets. For more information on the artifact repository, see the _{USER_GUIDE}_.


To create the repository structure, do the following:

. Open Business Central in your web browser and log in as a user with the `admin` role, for example `helloworlduser`.

. Create an organizational unit:
+
.. Click *Authoring* -> *Administration*.
.. On the perspective menu, click *Organizational Units* -> *Manage Organizational Units*.
.. In the displayed *Organizational Unit Manager* view, click *Add*.
+
In the displayed *Add New Organizational Unit* dialog box, define the unit properties and click *Ok*:
+
* *Name*: `John Doe`
* *Owner*: `finance-dept@company.org`

. Create a new repository in the `helloworld` organizational unit:
+
.. Click *Authoring* -> *Administration*.
.. On the perspective menu, click *Repositories* -> *New repository*.
.. In the displayed *New Repository* dialog box, define the repository properties:
+
* *Repository Name*: `helloworldrepo`
* *Organizational Unit*: `John Doe`
.. Click *Finish*.

. Click *Authoring* -> *Project Authoring*.

. In the Project Explorer in the organizational unit drop-down box, select `John Doe`, and in the repository drop-down box select `helloworldrepo`.
