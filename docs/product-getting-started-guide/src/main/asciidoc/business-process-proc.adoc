= Creating a Business Process

A business process is a graph that describes the order in which a series of steps must be executed using a flow chart. A business process consists of a collection of nodes that are linked to each other using connections. Each of the nodes represents one step in the overall process while the connections specify how to transition from one node to the other.

The mortgage application scenario is comprised of the following business processes:

* Validating the mortgage
* Calculating the mortgage
* Increasing the down payment

.Prerequisites

Created the *Mortgage_Process* data model. For further information, see <<defining_a_data_model>>.

== Validating the mortgage
The mortgage validation business process determines whether or not the new application contains the required data before proceeding. If all of the specified data requirements are met, the application will move on to the mortgage calculation business process.

. Log in to {CENTRAL}. Click *Menu* -> *Design* -> *Projects*, then *Mortgage_Process*.
. Click *Add Asset* -> *Business Process*.
. Enter the following values:
+
* *Business Process*: `MortgageApprovalProcess`
* *Package*: Select `com.myspace.mortgage_app`

. Click *Ok*. The diagram editor opens.
. In the upper-right corner, click the *Diagram properties* image:diagram_properties.png[] icon.
. Scroll down and expand *Process Data* and click image:btn_plus.png[] in the *Process Variables* section.
. Enter the following values:
+
* *Name*: `application`.
* *Data Type*: `Application [com.myspace.mortgage_app]`

. Click *Save*, then *Save*, to confirm your changes.

=== Creating outgoing connections
This section describes how to create an outgoing connection from the start event to an exclusive gateway and then from the exclusive gateway to the business rule task. Exclusive gateways are used to make decisions and react to events based on the available data. A business rule task represents a set of rules that must be evaluated.

{PRODUCT} contains a predefined selection of node types to simplify business process creation. The predefined node panel is located on the left side of the diagram editor. Click on the various node icons to reveal the available options as shown here.
