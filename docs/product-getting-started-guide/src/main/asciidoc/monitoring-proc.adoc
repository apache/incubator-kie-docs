* Integrate {PRODUCT} with the latest software solutions in the business.
* Modify or add {PRODUCT} functionality.
* Leverage provided tools to build their solutions faster.

{PRODUCT} focuses on as fast deployment time as possible. Because business processes and decisions often change quickly, {PRODUCT} enables quick reaction time.

Red Hat also offers a range of fully supported solutions which can be integrated with {PRODUCT}. An example of such integration is deploying {PRODUCT} on the Red Hat Openshift Container Platform, or integrating {PRODUCT} with Red Hat JBoss Fuse.
