= Creating a Business Process

A business process is a graph that describes the order in which a series of steps must be executed using a flow chart. A business process consists of a collection of nodes that are linked to each other using connections. Each of the nodes represents one step in the overall process while the connections specify how to transition from one node to the other. {PRODUCT} contains a predefined selection of node types to simplify business process creation.

The mortgage application scenario is comprised of the following business processes:

* Validating the mortgage
* Calculating the mortgage
* Increasing the down payment

.Prerequisites

Created the Mortgage Application data model. For further information, see <<defining_a_data_model>>.

=== Validating the mortgage
The mortgage validation business process determines whether or not the new application contains the required data before proceeding. If all of the specified data requirements are met, the application will move on to the mortgage calculation business process.

. Log in to {CENTRAL}. Click *Menu* -> *Design* -> *Projects*, then *Mortgage Application*.
. Click *Add Asset* -> *Business Process*.
. Enter the following values:
+
* *Business Process*: `MortgageApprovalProcess`
* *Package*: Select `com.myteam.mortgageapplication`

. Click *Ok*. The diagram editor opens.
. Click the *Diagram properties* image:diagram_properties.png[] icon.
. Scroll down to *Process Variables*, click image:btn_plus.png[] to add a new process variable, and enter the following values:
+
* *Name*: `Application`.
* *Type*: `Application [org.jboss.example]`

. Click *Save*, then *Save*, to confirm your changes.

==== Creating outgoing connections
This section shows you how to create an outgoing connection from the start event to an exclusive gateway and then from the exclusive gateway to the business rule task. Exclusive gateways are used to make decisions and react to events based on the available data. A business rule task represents a set of rules that must be evaluated.

. Create an outgoing connection from the start event to an exclusive gateway.

. Click on the task and enter the following values in the *Diagram properties* panel:
+
* *Name*: `Validation`
* *Ruleflow group*: `validation`
. Scroll down to the *Task Data* section and click image:btn_assign.png[] under *Assignments*.

. Click *Save*.
. In the diagram editor, click *Save*, then *Save*, to confirm your changes.

==== Defining the validation data
This section shows you how to define the data that will determine whether the application data is correct or if there is an error.

. Create an outgoing connection from the *Validation* task to an exclusive gateway
. Create an outgoing connection from the exclusive gateway to a new Business Rule Task.
. Click the created connection.
+
image::created-connection.png[]

. In the *Diagram Properties* panel, input the following values:

* *Condition Expression Language*: `drools`

. Click the Business Rule Task you created and define:
+
* *Name*: `retractValidation`
* *Ruleflow group*: `error`
. Create an outgoing connection from the *retractValidation* task to a user task.
+
image::user_task.png[]

. Click the user task and define:
+
* *Name*: `Correct Data`
* *Task Name*: `CorrectData`
* *Groups*: `broker`
. Click image:btn_assign.png[] under *Assignments*. In the *Validation Data I/O* window, create the following assignments:
** Input assignment:
*** *Name*: `taskinputApplication`
*** *Data Type*: `Application [org.jboss.example]`
*** *Source*: `Application`
** Output assignment:
*** *Name*: `taskoutputApplication`
*** *Data Type*: `Application [org.jboss.example]`
*** *Target*: `Application`
. Click *Save*.
. In the diagram editor, click *Save*, then *Save*, to confirm your changes.
. Connect the *Correct Data* back to the first exclusive gateway. Your workflow should look similar to the following diagram:
+

=== Calculating the mortgage
The mortgage calculation business process determines the applicant's mortgage borrowing limit.

. Return to the second exclusive gateway. Create an outgoing connection to a Business Rule Task.
+
image::second-gateway.png[]

. Click the created connection.
+
image::drools-valid.png[]

. In the *Diagram Properties* panel, input the following values:
+
* *Name*: `Valid`.
* *Condition Expression*: `not ValidationErrorDO()`
* *Condition Expression Language*: `drools`

. Click the created Business Rule Task and define:
+
* *Name*: `Mortgage Calculation`
* *Rule Flow Group*: `mortgagecalculation`
. Click on an empty space on the canvas, scroll down *Process Data* in the *Diagram Properties* panel, and declare a new process variable:
+
image::new-proc-var.png[]

+
* *Name*: `inlimit`
* *Type*: `boolean`

. Create an outgoing connection from the *MortgageCalculation* task and connect it to a user task.
+
image::qualify-task.png[]

. Click on the user task and define:
+
* *Name*: `Qualify`
* *Task Name*: `Qualify`
* *Groups*: `approver`
* Click image:btn_assign.png[] under *Assignments*. In the *Validation Data I/O* window, create the following assignments:
** Input assignments:
*** *Name*: `Application`
*** *Data Type*: `Application [org.jboss.example]`
*** *Source*: `Application`
*** *Name*: `inlimit`
*** *Data Type*: `boolean`
*** *Source*: `inlimit`

=== Increasing the down payment
The increasing the down payment business process checks to see if the applicant qualifies for the loan by increasing their down payment. The final result will be either the final loan approval, or loan denial based on the applicant's inability to increase the down payment.

. Create an outgoing connection from the *Final Approval* task and connect it to an end event.
+
