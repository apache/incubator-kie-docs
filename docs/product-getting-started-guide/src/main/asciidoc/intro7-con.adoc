{PRODUCT} enables you to automate your business processes and decisions. For example, a bank offers a housing mortgage loan service. When a customer wants to buy a new property using credit, they contact a broker at the bank who assists in filing for a mortgage loan. The broker collects information about the property and the customer, such as the salary of the customer, social security number, the property sale price, and the requested loan amount. The broker then submits a request on behalf of the customer.

Using {PRODUCT}, the housing mortgage department of the bank creates a complete business process for the mortgage loan. Whenever a customer submits a request, a new process instance is created. This ensures consistency in the quality of evaluating each request, provides complete visibility into the status of each request, and makes the process efficient and effective.
