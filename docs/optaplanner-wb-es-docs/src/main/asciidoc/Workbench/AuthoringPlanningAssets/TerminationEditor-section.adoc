By default, a time period that the planning engine is given to solve a problem instance is not limited. While this might be enforced by some scenarios (e.g. https://docs.jboss.org/optaplanner/release/latestFinal/optaplanner-docs/html/ch15.html#realTimePlanning[real-time] planning),
it is useful to have a mechanism to control total duration of the solving process.

Refer to https://docs.jboss.org/optaplanner/release/latest/optaplanner-docs/html/ch06.html#termination[OptaPlanner documentation]
for more information on supported termination types.

[NOTE]
====
Solver can be terminated manually using <<_kie.terminatesolving,REST API>> of the KIE Server.

Use *Add* to create new termination element within selected logical group and pick termination type. Input field will be displayed based on the selection.

Termination elements are organized into a tree structure. The editor supports definition of logical groups (represented by termination type *Nested termination*), which join multiple termination elements using logical operators (*And*/*Or*).
The scope of the operator is limited by the logical group in which it is defined.

Click *Remove* to remove the termination element from the termination tree. If the removal action is performed on the root element of a logical group,
all its children will be removed as well.
