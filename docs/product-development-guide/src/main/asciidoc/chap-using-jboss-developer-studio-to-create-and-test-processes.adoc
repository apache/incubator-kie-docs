[id='_exploring_a_jboss_bpm_suite_application']
== Components of Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite Application

A Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite application consists of the following components:

* A set of Java classes that become process variables or facts in rules.
* A set of services accessed from service tasks in a business process model.
* A business process model definition file in BPMN2 format.
* Rules assets (optional).
* A Java class that drives the application, including creation of a knowledge session, starting processes, and firing rules.

When you create a BPM Suite project in Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio, the following directories are generated:

* `src/main/java`: stores class files (facts).
* `src/main/resources`: stores `.drl` files (rules) and `.bpmn2` files (processes).

[id='_creating_a_jbpm_project']
== Creating Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite Project

To create a Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite project in Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio:

. Click *File* -> *New* -> *Project* and select *jBPM* -> *jBPM Project*. Click *Next*.
. Select the initial project contents: an empty project, a project populated with examples to help you get started quickly, or an example project from an online repository. Click *Next*.
. Specify the name of the project and select one of the two building options, *Java and jBPM Runtime classes* or *Maven*.
+
Furthermore, if you decided in the second step to create a project populated with examples, Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio enables you to add either a sample Hello World process, or a more advanced process including Human Tasks and persistence. Select the corresponding radio button to choose between these two options.
. Click *Finish*.

To test a non-empty project:

. Right-click the file that contains the main method: by default the `ProcessMain.java` file located at `_PROJECT_NAME_/src/main/java/` in the `com.sample` package.
. Select *Run As* -> *Java Application*.
+
The output is displayed in the *Console* tab.

The project contains the `kmodule.xml` configuration file under the `src/main/resources/META-INF` directory. The file defines which resources, such as processes and rules, will be loaded as a part of your project. By default, the file defines a knowledge base, called `kbase`, that loads resources located in the `com.sample` package. The default `kmodule.xml` file looks like follows:

[source,xml]
----
<kmodule xmlns="http://jboss.org/kie/6.0.0/kmodule">
  <kbase name="kbase" packages="com.sample"/>
</kmodule>
----

If you selected Maven as a building option, the project contains the `pom.xml` file. By default, two dependencies are specified: `kie-api` and `jbpm-test`. Add more dependencies as required by your project.

[id='_converting_an_existing_java_project_to_a_bpm_suite_project']

For more information about log files, see the following <<_file_logger>>.

[id='_file_logger']
=== File Logger

A file logger logs events from a session into a file. To create a logger, use `KnowledgeRuntimeLoggerFactory` and add it to a session.

NOTE: Using a threaded file logger causes the audit log to be saved to the file system in regular intervals. The audit viewer is then able to show the latest state.

See the following example of a threaded file logger with a specified audit log file and interval in milliseconds:

.Threaded File Logger
====
[source,java]
----
KnowledgeRuntimeLogger logger = KnowledgeRuntimeLoggerFactory
  .newThreadedFileLogger(ksession, "logdir/mylogfile", 1000);

// Work with the session here.

logger.close();

[id='_sect_synchronizing_jboss_developer_studio_workspace_with_business_central_repositories']
== Synchronizing Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio Workspace with Business Central Repositories

Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite allows you to synchronize your local workspace with one or more repositories that are managed inside Business Central with the help of Eclipse tooling for Git. Git is a popular distributed source code version control system. You can use any Git tool of your choice.

When you create and execute processes inside Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio, they get created on your local file system. Alternatively, you can import an existing repository from Business Central, apply changes and push these changes back into the Business Central repositories. This synchronization enables collaboration between developers using Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio and business analysts or end users using Business Central.

=== Importing Business Central Repository

. In Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio, click *File* -> *Import* and select *Git* -> *Projects from Git*. Click *Next*.
. Select *Clone URI* to connect to a repository managed by Business Central. Click *Next*.
. In the *URI* field, provide the URI of the repository to be imported in the following format:
+
[source]
----
ssh://HOST_NAME:8001/REPOSITORY_NAME
----
+
For example, if you are running Business Central on localhost, use the following URI to import the `jbpm-playground` repository:
+
[source]
----
ssh://localhost:8001/jbpm-playground
----
+
You can change the port used by the server to provide SSH access to the Git repository if necessary, using the system property `org.uberfire.nio.git.ssh.port`.
. Enter the user name and the password used for logging in to Business Central. Click *Next*.
. Select branches to be cloned from the remote repository and click *Next*.
. To define a local storage for this project, enter a path to an empty directory, make any configuration changes necessary, and click *Next*.
. Select *Import as general project* and click *Next*.
. Provide a name for the repository and click *Finish*.

NOTE: It is possible that you have committed and/or conflicting changes in your local version, you might have to resolve these conflicts and commit the merge results before you will be able to complete the merge successfully. It is recommended to update regularly, before you start updating a file locally, to avoid merge conflicts being detected when trying to commit changes.

[id='_importing_individual_projects_from_repository']
=== Importing Individual Projects from Repository

When you import a repository, all the projects inside that repository are downloaded. It is however useful to mount one specific project as a separate Java project. Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio is then able to:

* Interpret the information in the project's `pom.xml` file.
* Download and include any specified dependencies.
* Compile any Java class located in the project.

To import a project as a separate Java project:

. In the *Package Explorer* on the right side of Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio, right-click on one of the projects and click *Import...*.
. Select *Maven* -> *Existing Maven Projects* and click *Next*.
+
The *Import Maven Projects* dialog window opens with the project's `pom.xml` file displayed.
