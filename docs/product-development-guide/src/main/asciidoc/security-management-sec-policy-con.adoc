= Security policy

The set of permissions assigned to every user, role, and group is called the authorization or security policy. Every application contains a single security policy which is used each time the system checks a permission. The security policy is stored in .niogit file in the security.git repository.

The following files, located in the WEB-INF/classes directory under the applicationâ€™s WAR structure, contain the default settings for new groups and specific roles:

.New group and users security policies

Here is an example of the contents of a security policy file:

----
# Role "admin"
role.admin.permission.perspective.read=true
role.admin.permission.perspective.read.Dashboard=false

# Role "user"
role.user.permission.perspective.read=false
role.user.permission.perspective.read.Home=true
role.user.permission.perspective.read.Dashboard=true
----

Every entry defines a single permission which is assigned to a role or group. On application start up, the policy file is loaded and stored into memory.
