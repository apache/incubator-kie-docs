= Security policy

The set of permissions assigned to every user, role, and group is called the authorization or security policy. Every application contains a single security policy which is used each time the system checks a permission. The security policy is stored in the WEB-INF/classes/security-policy.properties file under the applicationâ€™s WAR structure.

[NOTE]
---- 
If no security policy is defined then the security management features are disabled and the application grants access to all resources and features to all users by default.
COMMENT: Is this correct?

Here is an example of a security policy file contents:
# Role "admin"
role.admin.permission.perspective.read=true
role.admin.permission.perspective.read.Dashboard=false

# Role "user"
role.user.permission.perspective.read=false
role.user.permission.perspective.read.Home=true
role.user.permission.perspective.read.Dashboard=true
----

Every entry defines a single permission which is assigned to a user, role, or group. On application start up, the policy file is loaded and stored into memory.
