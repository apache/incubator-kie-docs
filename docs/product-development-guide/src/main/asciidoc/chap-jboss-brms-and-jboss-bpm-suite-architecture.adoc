== Red Hat JBoss Business Rules Management System

Red Hat JBoss BRMS is an open source business rule management system that provides rules development, access, change, and management capabilities. In today's world, when IT organizations consistently face changes in terms of policies, new products, government imposed regulations, a system like JBoss BRMS makes it easy by separating business logic from the underlying code. It includes a rule engine, a rules development environment, a management system, and a repository. It allows both developers and business analysts to view, manage, and verify business rules as they are executed within an IT application infrastructure.

Red Hat JBoss BRMS can be executed in any Java EE-compliant container. It supports an open choice of authoring and management consoles and language and decision table inputs.

=== Red Hat JBoss BRMS Key Components

Red Hat JBoss BRMS comprises the following components:

* _Drools Expert_
+
Drools Expert is a pattern matching based rule engine that runs on Java EE application servers, Red Hat JBoss BRMS platform, or bundled with Java applications. It comprises an inference engine, a production memory, and a working memory. Rules are stored in the production memory and the facts that the inference engine matches the rules against, are stored in the working memory.
* _Business Central_
+
Business Central is a web-based application intended for business analysts for creation and maintenance of business rules and rule artifacts. It is designed to ease creation, testing, and packaging of rules for business users.
* _Drools Flow_
+
Drools flow provides business process capabilities to the Red Hat JBoss BRMS platform. This framework can be embedded into any Java application or can even run standalone on a server. A business process provides stepwise tasks using a flow chart, for the Rule Engine to execute.
* _Drools Fusion_
+
Drools Fusion provides event processing capabilities to the Red Hat JBoss BRMS platform. Drools Fusion defines a set of goals to be achieved such as:

== Red Hat JBoss Business Process Management Suite

Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite is an open source business process management system that combines business process management and business rules management. Red Hat JBoss BRMS offers tools to author rules and business processes, but does not provide tools to start or manage the business processes. Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite includes all the Red Hat JBoss BRMS functionality, with additional capabilities of business activity monitoring, starting business processes, and managing tasks using Business Central. Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite also provides a central repository to store rules and processes.

=== Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite Key Components

The Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite comprises the following components:

* _JBoss BPM Central (Business Central)_
+
Business Central is a web-based application for creating, editing, building, managing, and monitoring Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite business assets. It also allows execution of business processes and management of tasks created by those processes.
* _Business Activity Monitoring Dashboards_
+
The Business Activity Monitor (BAM) dashboard provides report generation capabilities. It enables you to use a pre-defined dashboard and even create your own customized dashboard.
* _Maven Artifact Repository_
+
Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite projects are built as Apache Maven projects and the default location of the Maven repository is `_WORKING_DIRECTORY_/repositories/kie`. You can specify an alternate repository location by changing the `org.guvnor.m2repo.dir` property.
+
Each project builds a JAR artifact file called a _KJAR_. You can store your project artifacts and dependent JAR files in this repository.
* _Execution Engine_
+
The Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite execution engine is responsible for executing business processes and managing the tasks, which result from these processes. Business Central provides a user interface for executing processes and managing tasks.
+

[NOTE]
====
To execute your business processes, you can use Business Central web application that bundles the execution engine, enabling a ready-to-use process execution environment. Alternatively, you can create your own execution server and embed the Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite and Red Hat JBoss BRMS libraries with your application using Java EE.

For example, if you are developing a web application, include the Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite or Red Hat JBoss BRMS libraries in the `WEB-INF/lib` folder of your application.
====

* _Business Central Repository_
+
The business artifacts of a Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite project, such as process models, rules, and forms, are stored in Git repositories managed through the Business Central. You can also access these repositories outside of Business Central through the Git or SSH protocols.

=== Use Case: ProcessÂ­-Based Solution in Loan Industry

This section describes a use case of deploying Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite to automate business processes (such as loan approval process) at a retail bank. This use case is a typical process-based specific deployment that might be the first step in a wider adoption of Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite throughout an enterprise. It leverages features of both business rules and processes of Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite.

A retail bank offers several types of loan products each with varying terms and eligibility requirements. Customers requiring a loan must file a loan application with the bank. The bank then processes the application in several steps, such as verifying eligibility, determining terms, checking for fraudulent activity, and determining the most appropriate loan product. Once approved, the bank creates and funds a loan account for the applicant, who can then access funds. The bank must be sure to comply with all relevant banking regulations at each step of the process, and has to manage its loan portfolio to maximize profitability. Policies are in place to aid in decision making at each step, and those policies are actively managed to optimize outcomes for the bank.

Business analysts at the bank model the loan application processes using the BPMN2 authoring tools (Process Designer) in Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite. Here is the process flow:
