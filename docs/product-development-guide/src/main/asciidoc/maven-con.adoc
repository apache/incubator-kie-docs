= Apache Maven

http://maven.apache.org/[Apache Maven] is a distributed build automation tool used in Java application development to build and manage software projects. You can use Maven to build, publish, and deploy your {PRODUCT} projects. Maven provides the following benefits:

* The build process is easy and a uniform build system is implemented across projects.
* All of the required JAR files for a project are made available at compile time.
* A proper project structure is configured.
* Dependencies and versions are well managed.
* The is no need for additional build processing because Maven builds output into a number of predefined types, such as JAR and WAR.

Maven uses repositories to store Java libraries, plug-ins, and other build artifacts. These repositories can be local or remote. {PRODUCT} maintains local and remote maven repositories that you can add to your project for accessing the rules, processes, events, and other project dependencies. When building projects and archetypes, Maven dynamically retrieves Java libraries and Maven plug-ins from local or remote repositories. Doing this promotes sharing and reuse of dependencies across projects.
