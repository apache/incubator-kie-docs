= Knowledge Store REST API

REST API calls to the Knowledge Store REST API enable you to manage spaces, repositories, and projects.

All `POST` and `DELETE` calls return details about the request as well as a job ID that can be used to request the job status and verify whether the job finished successfully. The `GET` calls return information about repositories, projects, and organizational units.

Parameters and results of these calls are provided in the form of JSON entities. Java classes for different entities are available in the `org.guvnor.rest.client` package and are referenced in the following text.
