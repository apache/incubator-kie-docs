[id='_chap_remote_api']
= Remote API

Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite provides various ways how to access the execution server in Business Central remotely including REST, JMS, SOAP, and EJB interfaces. Moreover, it provides remote Java API which allows developers to work with the `RuntimeEngine` interface while remote calls are executed in the background, using either REST or JMS.

[NOTE]
====
It is not recommended to use Business Central remote APIs to any further extent, with the exception of the Knowledge Store REST API. Instead, {KIE_SERVER} should be used. Both execution servers can be configured to use the same data source, thus processes and tasks started on one server are accessible from the other server. See section _Unified Execution Servers_ of _{ADMIN_GUIDE}_ for more details.

[id='_sect_rest_api']
== REST API

Representational State Transfer (hereinafter referred to as REST) is a style of software architecture of distributed systems. It enables a highly abstract client-server communication: clients initiate requests to servers to a particular URL with parameters if needed and servers process the requests and return appropriate responses based on the requested URL. The requests and responses are built around the transfer of representations of resources. A resource can be any coherent and meaningful concept that may be addressed, such as a repository, a process, a rule, and so on.

Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite and Red Hat JBoss BRMS provide a REST API for individual application components. The REST API implementations differ slightly:

* _Knowledge Store REST API_ calls interact with the artifact repository and are mostly asynchronous, which means that they continue running after the call as a job. The calls return a job ID which can be used after the REST API call was performed to request the job status and verify whether the job finished successfully. Parameters of these calls are provided in the form of JSON entities. See <<sect_knowledge_store_rest_api>>.

The following APIs are only available in Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite.

* _Deployment REST API_ calls perform actions on deployments or retrieve information about one ore more deployments. See <<_sect_deployment_rest_api>>.
* The _Process Image REST API_ allows you to get a diagram of your process in Business Central through the remote REST API. See <<_sect_process_image_rest_api>>.
* _Runtime REST API_ calls interact with the process engine, task service, and business rule engine in Business Central. See <<_sect_runtime_rest_api>>.
* The _REST Query API_ allows developers to query tasks, process instances, and their variables. The operations results are grouped by the given process instance. See <<_sect_the_rest_query_api>>.

All REST API calls use the following URL with the request body: `http://__SERVER__:__PORT__/business-central/rest/_REQUEST_BODY_`.

[NOTE]
.Calls on Resources Are Not Supported
====
It is not possible to issue REST API calls on project resources, such as rule files, work item definitions, process definition files, and so on. Operations on such files should be performed using Git and its REST API directly.
====

[id='sect_knowledge_store_rest_api']
=== Knowledge Store REST API

REST API calls to the Knowledge Store REST API allow you to manage the organization units, repositories, and projects.

All `POST` and `DELETE` calls return details about the request as well as a job ID that can be used to request the job status and verify whether the job finished successfully. The `GET` calls return information about repositories, projects, and organizational units.

Parameters and results of these calls are provided in the form of JSON entities. Java classes for different entities are available in the `org.guvnor.rest.client` package and are referenced in the following text.

==== Job Calls

Most Knowledge Store REST calls return a job ID after they are issued. This is necessary as the calls are asynchronous and it is required to be able to reference the job later to check its status as it goes through a job lifecycle.

During its lifecycle, a job can have the following statuses:

.Job Statuses
[cols="1,3a", frame="all", options="header"]
|===
|Status
|Description

|`ACCEPTED`
|The job was accepted and is being processed.

|`BAD_REQUEST`
|The request was not accepted as it contained incorrect content.

|`RESOURCE_NOT_EXIST`
|The requested resource (path) does not exist.

|`DUPLICATE_RESOURCE`
|The resource already exists.

|`SERVER_ERROR`
|An error on the server side occurred.

|`SUCCESS`
|The job finished successfully.

|`FAIL`
|The job failed.

|`APPROVED`
|The job was approved.

|`DENIED`
|The job was denied.

|`GONE`
|The job ID could not be found. A job can be `GONE` in the following cases:

* The job was explicitly removed.
* The job finished and has been deleted from a status cache. A job is removed from a status cache after the cache has reached its maximum capacity.
* The job never existed.
|===

The following job calls are provided:

[GET] /jobs/_JOB_ID_::
Returns a status of the given `_JOB_ID_`.

[id='_maven_calls']
==== Maven Calls

Maven calls are calls to a project in the Knowledge Store that allow you to compile and deploy the project resources.

The following Maven calls are provided:

[POST] /repositories/_REPOSITORY_NAME_/projects/_PROJECT_NAME_/maven/compile/::
Compiles the project. Equivalent to `mvn compile`. Returns a `CompileProjectRequest` instance.

[POST] /repositories/_REPOSITORY_NAME_/projects/_PROJECT_NAME_/maven/install/::
Installs the project. Equivalent to `mvn install`. Returns a `InstallProjectRequest` instance.

[POST] /repositories/_REPOSITORY_NAME_/projects/_PROJECT_NAME_/maven/test/::
Compiles and runs the tests. Equivalent to `mvn test`. Returns a `TestProjectRequest` instance.

[POST] /repositories/_REPOSITORY_NAME_/projects/_PROJECT_NAME_/maven/deploy/::
Deploys the project. Equivalent to `mvn deploy`. Returns a `DeployProjectRequest` instance.

[id='_sect_deployment_rest_api']
=== Deployment REST API

The KIE module JAR files can be deployed or undeployed using the Business Central UI or the REST API calls.

Deployment units are represented by a unique deployment ID consisting of the following elements separated by colons:

. Group ID
. Artifact ID
. Version
. KIE base ID (optional)
. KIE session ID (optional)

[id='_deployment_calls']
==== Deployment Calls

The following deployment calls are provided:

[GET] /deployment/::
Returns a list of all available deployed instances in a `JaxbDeploymentUnitList` instance.

[GET] /deployment/processes::
Returns a list of all available deployed process definitions in a `JaxbProcessDefinitionList` instance.

[GET] /deployment/_DEPLOYMENT_ID_::
Returns an instance of `JaxbDeploymentUnit` containing the information about a deployment unit, including its configuration.

[POST] /deployment/_DEPLOYMENT_ID_/deploy::
Deploys a deployment unit referenced by `_DEPLOYMENT_ID_`. The call returns a `JaxbDeploymentJobResult` instance with a status of the request.
+
The deploy operation is asynchronous. Use the described GET calls to get a status of the deployment.
+
When a project is deployed, it is _activated_ by default: new process instances can be started using the process definitions and other information in the deployment. However, at later point in time, users may want to make sure that the deployment is no longer used without necessarily aborting or stopping the existing (running) process instances. To do so, the deployment can first be _deactivated_ before it will be removed at a later date.
+
[NOTE]
====
Configuration options such as the runtime strategy should be defined before deploying the JAR files and cannot be changed post deployment.
====
+
To override the session strategy specified in the deployment descriptor, use the `strategy` query parameter. The following not case-sensitive values are supported:
+
  * `SINGLETON`
  * `PER_REQUEST`
  * `PER_PROCESS_INSTANCE`
+
For example:
+
[source]
----
[POST] /deployment/DEPLOYMENT_ID/deploy?strategy=PER_REQUEST
----
+
To use a specific merge mode in the deployment request, specify the `mergemode` query parameter. The following not case-sensitive values are supported:
+
  * `KEEP_ALL`
  * `OVERRIDE_ALL`
  * `OVERRIDE_EMPTY`
  * `MERGE_COLLECTIONS`
+
It is possible to post a deployment descriptor or its fragment with the deployment request, which allows to override other deployment descriptors. To do so, set a content type of the request to `application/xml` and make sure the request body is a valid deployment descriptor content, for example:
+
[source,xml]
----
<deployment-descriptor xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.jboss.org/jbpm deployment-descriptor.xsd" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
  <audit-mode>JMS</audit-mode>
</deployment-descriptor>
----
+
[WARNING]
====
To avoid the _Unsupported Media Type_ error on Oracle WebLogic Server, make sure the `deployment-descriptor` is always provided, even as an empty-element tag, and the header is specified as `Content-Type`. See the example call:

[source]
----
curl -v -H 'Content-Type: application/xml' -u bpmsAdmin --data "<deployment-descriptor/>" -X POST 'localhost:7001/business-central/rest/deployment/com.sample:bpm-processes:1.1/deploy'
----
====

[POST] /deployment/_DEPLOYMENT_ID_/undeploy::
Undeploys a deployment unit with a specified `_DEPLOYMENT_ID_` and returns a `JaxbDeploymentJobResult` instance with a status of the request.
+
The undeploy operation is asynchronous. Use the described GET calls to get the status of the deployment.

[NOTE]
====
The `deploy` and `undeploy` operations can fail if one of the following is true:

* An identical job has already been submitted to the queue and has not yet completed.
* The amount of `deploy` and `undeploy` jobs submitted but not yet processed exceeds the job cache size.
====

[POST] /deployment/_DEPLOYMENT_ID_/activate::
Activates a deployment. Returns a `JaxbDeploymentJobResult` instance with a status of the request.
+
The `activate` operation is asynchronous.

[POST] /deployment/_DEPLOYMENT_ID_/deactivate::
Deactivates a deployment. Returns a `JaxbDeploymentJobResult` instance with a status of the request.
+
The `deactivate` operation is asynchronous.

[NOTE]
====
* The `deactivate` operation ensures that no new process instances can be started with the existing deployment.
* If it is decided that a deactivated deployment should be reactivated instead of deleted, the `activate` operation should be used to reactivate the deployment. A deployment is always _activated_ by default when it is initially deployed.
====

WARNING: In version 6.4 of the product, start timer events keep starting new process instances after a deployment is deactivated. This is a known issue.

[GET] /deployment/_DEPLOYMENT_ID_/processes::
Lists all available process definitions in a given deployment unit. Returns an instance of `JaxbProcessDefinitionList`.

[id='_asynchronous_calls1']
==== Asynchronous Calls

The following deployment calls described in the previous section are asynchronous REST operations:

* `/deployment/_DEPLOYMENT_ID_/deploy`
* `/deployment/_DEPLOYMENT_ID_/undeploy`
* `/deployment/_DEPLOYMENT_ID_/activate`
* `/deployment/_DEPLOYMENT_ID_/deactivate`

Asynchronous calls allow a user to issue a request and continue to the next task before the previous task in the queue is finished. Therefore, the information received after posting a call does not reflect the actual state or eventual status of the operation. It returns a status 202 upon the completion of the request: "_The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed._"

This means that:

* The POST request has been successfully queued, but the result of the actual operation (deploying or undeploying the deployment unit) cannot be determined from this code. Interrogate the `JaxbDeploymentUnit` object returned by the GET `/deployment/_DEPLOYMENT_ID_` call to obtain that state.
* The `JaxbDeploymentUnit` object returned using the GET request is only valid for the point in time which it was checked. Its status may change after the GET request has completed.

[id='_sect_process_image_rest_api']
=== Process Image REST API

Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite allows you to get a diagram of your process in Business Central through the remote REST API. To get the diagram, you need to generate the image based on the SVG source first, which is done automatically by the process designer when you save a process definition.

To ensure that the process is saved in the process designer as SVG and is added to the kJAR, set `<storesvgonsave enabled="true"/>` in the `/org.kie.workbench.KIEWebapp/profiles/jbpm.xml` file in `business-central.war`. `SVGImageProcessor` adds further annotations based on the audit log data. You can extend `SVGImageProcessor` further for more advanced visualizations.

NOTE: It is recommended to use {KIE_SERVER} instead of Business Central. <<_intelligent_process_server_ui_extension>> provides a richer set of REST endpoints, including process diagram images as well as process and task forms.

The following process image REST operations are provided by Business Central:

[GET] /runtime/_DEPLOYMENT_ID_/process/_PROCESS_DEFINITION_ID_/image::
Returns an SVG image of the process definition diagram.

[GET] /runtime/_DEPLOYMENT_ID_/process/_PROCESS_DEFINITION_ID_/image/_PROCESS_INSTANCE_ID_::
Returns an SVG image of the process instance diagram, with highlighted currently active nodes.

[id='_sect_runtime_rest_api']
=== Runtime REST API

Runtime REST API provided by Business Central allows you to work with its underlying execution server, including process engine, task service, and business rule engine, and manipulate runtime data.

NOTE: It is recommended to use {KIE_SERVER} instead of Business Central for all remote calls. See <<_realtime_decision_server>> for more information about equivalent REST endpoints.

With the exception of `execute` operations (see <<_execute_calls>>), all the other REST calls can use JAXB or JSON. The calls are synchronous and return the requested data as JAXB objects by default. When using JSON, the JSON media type (`application/json`) should be added to the `ACCEPT` header of the REST call.

[id='_rest_api_query_parameters']
==== Query Parameters

The Runtime REST API calls can have various query parameters. To add a parameter to a call, add the `?` symbol to the URL and a parameter name with its value. For example, `http://localhost:8080/business-central/rest/task/query?workItemId=393` returns a list of all tasks (`TaskSummary` instances) based on the work item with ID `393`. Note that parameters and their values are _case sensitive_.

[id='_rest_api_map_parameters']
===== Map Parameters

Some runtime REST API calls can use the `Map` parameter. That means it is possible to submit key-value pairs to the operation using a query parameter prefixed with the `map_` keyword. For example,

[source]
----
map_age=5000
----

is translated as

[source]
----
{ "age" => Long.parseLong("5000") }
----

.GET Call That Returns All Tasks to Locally Running Application Using curl
====
[source]
----
curl -v -H 'Accept: application/json' -u eko 'localhost:8080/business-central/rest/tasks/'
----
====

To perform the runtime REST calls from your Java application, see <<_sect_remote_java_api>>.

While interacting with the Remote API, some classes are to be included in the deployment. This enables users to pass instances of their own classes as parameters to certain operations. The REST calls that start with `/task` often do not contain any information about the associated deployment. In this case, an extra query parameter `deploymentId` is added to the REST call allowing the server to find the appropriate deployment class and deserialize the information passed with the call.

[id='_pagination5']
===== Pagination

The pagination parameters allow you to define pagination of REST call results. The following pagination parameters are available:

`page` or `p`::
A number of the page to be returned. The default value is `1`, which means that page number `1` is returned.

`pageSize` or `s`::
A number of items per page. The default value is `10`.

If both the long option and the short option are included in a URL, the longer version of the parameter takes precedence. When no pagination parameters are included, the returned results are not paginated.

Pagination parameters can be applied to the following REST requests:

* `/task/query`
* `/history/instances`
* `/history/instance/*`
* `/task/query`

.REST Request Body with Pagination Parameter
====
[source]
----
/history/instances?page=3&pageSize=20
/history/instances?p=3&s=20
----
====

[id='_object_data_type_parameters']
===== Object Data Type Parameters

By default, any object parameters provided in a REST call are considered to be strings. If you need to explicitly define the data type of a parameter in a call, you can do so by adding one of the following values to the parameter:

* `\d+i`: Integer
* `\d+l`: Long

.REST Request Body with Integer Parameter
====
[source]
----
/rest/runtime/business-central/process/org.jbpm.test/start?map_var1=1234i
----
====

Note that the intended use of these object parameters is to define data types of send signal and process variable values. For example, consider the use in the `startProcess` command in the `execute` operation. See <<_execute_calls>>.

[id='_sect_runtime_calls']
==== Runtime Calls

Runtime REST calls allow you to work with runtime data such as process instances, signals, and work items.

NOTE: If you want to use other features of the execution engine that are not available as direct REST calls, look at generic `execute` operations. See <<_execute_calls>>.

===== Process Calls

Process calls allow you to start new process instances, abort the existing ones, and get details about running process instances and their variables.

The following runtime process calls are provided:

[POST] /runtime/_DEPLOYMENT_ID_/process/__PROCESS_DEFINITION_ID__/start::
Starts a new instance of `__PROCESS_DEFINITION_ID__` process and returns `JaxbProcessInstanceResponse` with information about the process instance.
+
This operation accepts map parameters. For more information, see <<_rest_api_map_parameters>>. If you want to pass custom classes, use Remove Java API. See <<_sect_remote_java_api>>.

[POST] /runtime/_DEPLOYMENT_ID_/withvars/process/__PROCESS_DEFINITION_ID__/start::
Starts a new instance of `__PROCESS_DEFINITION_ID__` process and returns `JaxbProcessInstanceWithVariablesResponse` with information about the process instance including process variables.

[GET] /runtime/_DEPLOYMENT_ID_/process/__PROCESS_DEFINITION_ID__/startform::
If the `__PROCESS_DEFINITION_ID__` process exists, returns `JaxbProcessInstanceFormResponse` containing a URL where the process form can be found.

[POST] /runtime/_DEPLOYMENT_ID_/process/instance/__PROCESS_INSTANCE_ID__/abort::
Aborts the process instance and returns `JaxbGenericResponse` indicating success or failure of the operation.

[GET] /runtime/_DEPLOYMENT_ID_/process/instance/__PROCESS_INSTANCE_ID__::
Returns `JaxbProcessInstanceResponse` with details about the active process instance.

[GET] /runtime/_DEPLOYMENT_ID_/withvars/process/instance/__PROCESS_INSTANCE_ID__::
Returns `JaxbProcessInstanceWithVariablesResponse` with details about the active process instance including process variables.

[GET] /runtime/_DEPLOYMENT_ID_/process/instance/__PROCESS_INSTANCE_ID__/variable/_VARIABLE_NAME_::
Returns the `_VARIABLE_NAME_` variable in the `__PROCESS_INSTANCE_ID__` process instance. If the variable is primitive, the variable value is returned.

[id='_signal_calls']
===== Signal Calls

Signal calls allow you to send a signal to a deployment or a particular process instance.

All signal calls accept the following query parameters:

* `signal`: the name of the signal event (required).
* `event`: the data associated with this event.

The following signal calls are provided:

[POST] /runtime/_DEPLOYMENT_ID_/signal::
Sends a signal event to all active process instances as well as process definitions with a `Signal` start event (see <<_start_events>>) in the given deployment unit. Returns `JaxbGenericResponse` with the status of the operation.

[id='_work_item_calls']
===== Work Item Calls

Work item calls allow you to complete or abort a particular work item as well as get details about a work item instance.

The parameters of work item calls must match the following regular expressions:

* `_DEPLOYMENT_ID_`: `(:[\\w\\.-]){2,2}(:[\\w\\.-]*){0,2}}`
* `__WORK_ITEM_ID__`: `[0-9]+`

The following work item calls are provided:

[id='_task_operations']
===== Task Operations

The following operations can be executed on a task:

.Task Operations
[cols="1,3a", frame="all", options="header"]
|===
|Task
|Action

|`activate`
|Activate the task.

|`claim`
|Claim the task.

|`claimnextavailable`
|Claim the next available task assigned to the user.

|`complete`
|Complete the task with the specified map parameters. See <<_rest_api_map_parameters>>.

|`delegate`
|Delegate the task to the user specified by the `targetEntityId` query parameter.

|`exit`
|Exit the task.

This operation can be performed by any user or a group specified as the administrator of a human task. If the task does not specify any values, the system automatically adds user `Administrator` and group `Administrators` to the task.

|`fail`
|Fail the task.

|`forward`
|Forward the task.

|`release`
|Release the task.

|`resume`
|Resume the task.

|`skip`
|Skip the task.

|`start`
|Start the task.

|`stop`
|Stop the task.

|`suspend`
|Suspend the task.

|`nominate`
|Nominate either a user or a group, specified by the `user` or the `group` query parameter, for the task.
|===

[id='_content_operations']
===== Content Operations

Both task and content operations return the serialized content associated with the given task.

The content associated with a task is stored in a database in a serialized form either as a string with XML data or a map with several different key-value pairs. The content is serialized using the algorithm based on Protocol Buffers: `protobuf`. This serialization process is usually executed by the static methods in the `org.jbpm.services.task.utils.ContentMarshallerHelper` class.

If the client that calls the task content operation do not have access to the `org.jbpm.services.task.utils.ContentMarshallerHelper` class, the task content cannot be deserialized. When using the REST call to obtain task content, the content is first deserialized using the `ContentMarshallerHelper` class and then serialized with the common Java serialization mechanism.

Due to restrictions of REST operations, only the objects for which the following is true can be returned by the task content operations:

* The requested objects are instances of a class that implements the `Serializable` interface. In the case of `Map` objects, they only contain values that implement the `Serializable` interface.
* The objects are _not_ instances of a local class, an anonymous class, or arrays of a local or an anonymous class.
* The object classes are present on the class path of the server application.

[id='_sect_the_rest_query_api']
=== REST Query API

The REST Query API allows developers to query tasks, process instances, and their variables. The operations results are grouped by the process instance they belong to.

==== URL Layout

The rich query operations can be performed using the following URLs:

* `http://__SERVER__:__PORT__/business-central/rest/query/runtime/task`
+
Rich query for task summaries and process variables.
* `http://__SERVER__:__PORT__/business-central/rest/query/runtime/process`
+
Rich query for process instances and process variables.

You can specify a number of different query parameters. For more information, see <<_sect_query_parameters>>.

[id='_sect_query_parameters']
==== Query Parameters

In the text below, _query parameters_ are strings such as `processInstanceId`, `taskId`, or `tid`. These query parameters are not case sensitive, with the exception of those also specifying the name of a user-defined variable. _Parameters_ are the values passed with query parameters, for example `org.process.frombulator`, `29`, or `harry`.

When you submit a REST call to the query operation, the URL could be similar to the following:

[source]
----
http://localhost:8080/business-central/rest/query/runtime/process?processId=org.process.frombulator&piid=29
----

A query containing multiple query parameters searches for their intersection. However, many of the query parameters described later can be entered multiple times. In such case, the query searches for any results that match one or more of the entered values.

.Repeated Query Parameters
====
[source]
----
processId=org.example.process&processInstanceId=27&processInstanceId=29
----

This process instance query returns a result that contains information about process instances with the `org.example.process` process definition and ID `27` or `29`.
====

WARNING: When running Business Central on WebSphere application server, the server ignores the parameters of REST Query API calls without a value (for example `http://localhost:9080/business-central/rest/query/runtime/process?vv=john&all`). However, the server accepts the call if you specify an empty value for these parameters. For example `http://localhost:9080/business-central/rest/query/runtime/process?vv=john&all=`.

[id='_range_and_regular_expression_parameters']
===== Range and Regular Expression Parameters

There are two ways to define a value of a query parameter: using ranges or a simple regular expression.

[id='_range_query_parameters']
===== Range Query Parameters

To define the start of a range, add `_min` to the parameter's name. To define the end of a range, add `_max` to the parameter's name. Range ends are inclusive.

Defining only one end of the range results in querying on an open ended range.

.Range Parameters
====
[source]
----
processId=org.example.process&taskId_min=50&taskId_max=53
----

This task query returns a result that contains only the information about tasks associated with the `org.example.process` process definition and the tasks that have an ID between `50` and `53`, inclusive.

The following tak query differs:

[source]
----
processId=org.example.process&taskId_min=52
----

This task query returns a result that contains only the information about tasks associated with the `org.example.process` process definition and the tasks that have an ID larger than or equal to `52`.
====

[id='_regular_expression_query_parameters']
===== Regular Expression Query Parameters

To use regular expressions in a query parameter, add `_re` to the parameter's name. The regular expression language contains two special characters:

* `*` means 0 or more characters
* `.` means 1 character

The slash character (`\`) is not interpreted.

.Regular Expression Parameters
====
[source]
----
processId_re=org.example.*&processVersion=2.0
----

This process instance query returns a result that fulfills the following:

* Contains only the information about process instances associated with a process definition whose name matches the regular expression `org.example.*`. This includes:
** `org.example.process`
** `org.example.process.definition.example.long.name`
** `orgXexampleX`
* Contains only the information about process instances that have process version `2.0`.
====

[id='_parameter_table']
==== List of Query Parameters

Query parameters that can be defined in ranges have an `X` in the `MIN/MAX` column. Query parameters that use regular expressions have an `X` in the `Regex` column. The last column describes whether a query parameter can be used in task queries, process instance queries, or both.

[*1*] The date operations require strings with the `yy-MM-dd_HH:mm:ss` date format as their values. However, you can submit only a part of the date:

* Submitting only the date (`yy-MM-dd`) means that a time of 00:00:00 is used (the beginning of the day).
* Submitting only the time (`HH:mm:ss`) means that the current date is used.

.Example Date Strings
[cols="1,3", frame="all", options="header"]
|===
|Date String
|Actual Meaning

|`15-05-29_13:40:12`
|May 29th, 2015, 13:40:12 (1:40:12 PM)

|`14-11-20`
|November 20th, 2014, 00:00:00

|`9:30:00`
|Today, 9:30:00 (AM)
|===

For more information about the used format, see the http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html[Class SimpleDateFormat documentation].

[*2*] The `var` query parameter is used differently than other parameters. If you want to specify both the variable ID and the value of a variable, as opposed to just the variable ID, do so by using the `var` query parameter. The syntax is `var_{_VARIABLE_ID_}={_VARIABLE_VALUE_}`.

For example, the query parameter and parameter pair `var_myVar=foo3` queries for process instances with a variable called `myVar` that have value `foo3`.

[*3*] The `varreggex` (or just `vr`) parameter works similarly as the `var` query parameter. The value part of the query parameter can be a regular expression.

[*4*] By default, only the information from the latest variable instance logs is retrieved. Using this parameters, you can retrieve all the variable instance logs that match the given criteria.

[id='_query_output_format']
==== Query Output Format

The REST Query API calls return the following results:

* `JaxbQueryProcessInstanceResult` for all process instance queries.
* `JaxbQueryTaskResult` for all task queries.

[id='_execute_calls']
=== Execute Operations

For remote communication, it is recommended to use the Remote Java API. See <<_sect_remote_java_api>>.

For performing runtime operations that involves passing a custom Java object used in the process (such as starting a process instance with process variables, or completing a task with task variables), you can use the approach mentioned in <<_custom_model_objects_and_remote_api>>.

If it is not possible to use the Remote Java API or if your requirement is to use the REST API directly, you may consider using the `execute` operations. While the REST API accepts only string or integer values as parameters, the `execute` operation allows you to send complex Java objects to perform Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite runtime operations.

The `execute` operations are created to support the Remote Java API. Use the operations only in exceptional circumstances, such as:

* When you need to pass complex objects as parameters.
* When it is not possible to use `/runtime` or `/task` endpoints.

Additionally, you can consider using the `execute` operations in cases when you are running any other client besides Java.

In the following example, a complex object `org.MyPOJO` is passed as a parameter to start a process:

----

In this example, the `org.kie.remote.jaxb.gen` package classes are used for the client, which are in the `org.kie.remote:kie-remote-client` artifact. The deployment ID is set using a new HTTP header `Kie-Deployment-Id` that is also available as the `JaxbSerializationProvider.EXECUTE_DEPLOYMENT_ID_HEADER` Java constant.

The `/execute` call takes the `JaxbCommandsRequest` object as its parameter. The `JaxbCommandsRequest` object contains a list of `org.kie.api.command.Command` objects. The commands are stored in the `JaxbCommandsRequest` object, which are converted to a string representation and sent to the `execute` REST call. The `JaxbCommandsRequest` parameters are `deploymentId` and a `Command` object.

When you send a command to the `/execute` endpoint, a Java code is used to convert the `Command` object to `String` in an XML format. Once you generate the XML, you can use any Java or non-Java client to send it to the REST endpoint exposed by Business Central.

Note that the `org.MyPOJO` class must be the same in your client code as well as on the server side. To achieve this, share it through a Maven dependency: create the `org.MyPOJO` class using the Data Modeler in Business Central and in your REST client, add the dependency of the project which includes the `org.MyPOJO` class. An example of the `pom.xml` file with the dependency of the project created in Business Central that contains the `org.MyPOJO` class and other required dependencies follows.

In the example, `com.redhat.gss:remote-process-start-with-bean:1.0` is the kJAR created by Business Central. The kJAR includes the `org.MyPOJO` class. By sharing the dependency, you ensure that your `org.MyPOJO` class on the server matches with the one on the client.

Another way to achieve this is to create a data model using Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio, export the JAR file, and add it as a dependency of both the Business Central kJAR and your REST client.

[id='_sect_jms']
== JMS

The Java Message Service (JMS) is an API that allows Java Enterprise components to communicate with each other asynchronously and reliably.

Operations on the runtime engine and tasks can be done through the JMS API exposed by Business Central. However, it is not possible to manage deployments or the knowledge base using this JMS API.

Unlike the REST API, it is possible to send a batch of commands to the JMS API that will all be processed in one request after which the responses to the commands will be collected and returned in one response message.

NOTE: It is not recommended to use JMS directly. Use the Remote Java API when you want to communicate with Business Central. The better way is to use the {KIE_SERVER} Java Client API. See <<_rest_api_overview>>.

=== JMS Queue Setup

When you deploy Business Central on the Java EE application server, it automatically creates the following JMS queues:

* `KIE.SESSION`
* `KIE.TASK`
* `KIE.RESPONSE`
* `KIE.AUDIT`
* `KIE.EXECUTOR`
* `KIE.SIGNAL`

The `KIE.SESSION` and `KIE.TASK` queues are used to send request messages to the JMS API. Command response messages will be then placed on the `KIE.RESPONSE` queues. Command request messages that involve starting and managing business processes should be sent to the `KIE.SESSION` queue and command request messages that involve managing human tasks should be sent to the `KIE.TASK` queue.

Although there are two different input queues, `KIE.SESSION` and `KIE.TASK`, it is to provide multiple input queues to optimize processing: command request messages will be processed in the same manner regardless of which queue they are sent to. However, in some cases, users may send more requests involving human tasks than requests involving business processes, but then not want the processing of business process-related request messages to be delayed by the human task messages. By sending the appropriate command request messages to the appropriate queues, this problem can be avoided.

The term _command request message_ used above refers to a JMS byte message that contains a serialized `JaxbCommandsRequest` object. At the moment, only XML serialization is supported as opposed to, for example, JSON or `protobuf`.

JMS queue `KIE.EXECUTOR` is used in the Job Executor component to speed up processing of asynchronous tasks and defined jobs. See <<_job_executor_for_asynchronous_execution>> for more information about Job Executor. Note that the executor can work without JMS. You can disable JMS, for example, when you deploy {PRODUCT} on container without full JMS support out of the box, such as Tomcat. To disable JMS, set the following property: `org.kie.executor.jms=false`.

[id='_example_jms_usage']
=== Example JMS Usage

The following example shows the usage of the JMS API. The numbers (callouts) in the example refer to notes below that explain particular parts of the example. It is provided for the advanced users that do not wish to use the Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite Remote Java API which otherwise incorporates the logic shown below.

1. These classes can all be found in the `kie-services-client` and the `kie-services-jaxb` JARs.

2. The `JaxbCommandsRequest` instance is the "holder" object in which you can place all of the commands you want to execute in a particular request. By using the `JaxbCommandsRequest.getCommands()` method, you can retrieve the list of commands to add more commands to the request.
+
A deployment ID is required for command request messages that deal with business processes. Command request messages that only contain human task-related commands do not require a deployment ID.

3. Note that the JMS message sent to the remote JMS API must be constructed as follows:
+
* It must be a JMS byte message.
* It must have a filled JMS Correlation ID property.
* It must have an `int` property called *serialization* set to an acceptable value: only `0` at the moment.
* It must contain a serialized instance of a `JaxbCommandsRequest`, added to the message as a UTF string.

4. The same serialization mechanism used to serialize the request message will be used to serialize the response message.

5. To match the response, use the `index` field of the returned `JaxbCommandResponse` instances. This `index` field will match the index of the initial command. Because not all commands will return a result, it is possible to send three commands with a command request message, and then receive a command response message that only includes one `JaxbCommandResponse` message with an `index` value `1`. This value then identifies it as the response to the second command.

6. Since many of the results returned by various commands are not serializable, the JMS API of Business Central converts these results into JAXB equivalents, all of which implement the `JaxbCommandResponse` interface. The `JaxbCommandResponse.getResult()` method then returns the JAXB equivalent to the actual result, which will conform to the interface of the result.
+
For example, in the code above, the `StartProcessCommand` returns `ProcessInstance`. To return this object to the requester, the `ProcessInstance` is converted to `JaxbProcessInstanceResponse` and then added as `JaxbCommandResponse` to the command response message. The same applies to `List<TaskSummary>` that is returned by `GetTaskAssignedAsPotentialOwnerCommand`.
+
However, not all methods that can be called on `ProcessInstance` can be called on the `JaxbProcessInstanceResponse` because `JaxbProcessInstanceResponse` is simply a representation of a `ProcessInstance` object. This applies to various other command response as well. In particular, methods which require an active (backing) `KieSession`, such as `ProcessInstance.getProcess()` or `ProcessInstance.signalEvent(String type, Object event)`, will throw `UnsupportedOperationException`.

7. By default, a session is created in `kieServerMDB` with the acknowledge mode set to `Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE` and the transacted value set to `false`, resulting in the following response as shown in the example:
+
[source,java]
----
session = connection.createSession(false,Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE);
----
+
If a generic resource adapter is used with JMS, this session setting can generate a null pointer error. You can either temporarily work around this issue or resolve it going forward:

* To work around this issue when a generic resource adapter is used, set the transacted value to `true` and set the session type to `SESSION_TRANSACTED`:
+
[source,java]
----
session = connection.createSession(true, Session.SESSION_TRANSACTED);
----

* To resolve this issue when a generic resource adapter is used, add the following under `<system properties>` in the `standalone.xml` file of {EAP}:
+
[source,java]
----
org.kie.server.jms.session.tx=true  // If not set, defaults to `false`.
org.kie.server.jms.session.ack=$INTEGER  // Integer value matching one of the javax.jms.Session constants that represent `ack` mode.

[id='_soap_api']
== SOAP API

Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) is a type of distribution architecture used for exchanging information. SOAP requires a minimal amount of overhead on the system and is used as a protocol for communication, while it is versatile enough to allow the use of different transport protocols.

Like REST, SOAP allows client-server communication. Clients can initiate requests to servers using URLs with parameters. The servers then process the requests and return responses based on the particular URL.

[id='_client_side_java_webservice_client']
=== CommandWebService

Business Central in {PRODUCT} provides a SOAP interface in the form of `CommandWebService`. A Java client is provided as a generated `CommandWebService` class and can be used as follows.

Classes generated by the `kie-remote-client` module function as a client-side interface for SOAP. The `CommandWebServiceClient` class referenced in the test code below is generated by the Web Service Description Language (WSDL) in the `kie-remote-client` JAR.

  JaxbCommandsRequest req = new JaxbCommandsRequest(deploymentId, cmd);
  final JaxbCommandsResponse response = client.execute(req);

  JaxbCommandResponse<?> cmdResp = response.getResponses().get(0);

----

The SOAP interface of Business Central in {PRODUCT} is currently available for Red Hat JBoss EAP, IBM WebSphere, and Oracle WebLogic servers.

[id='_sect_ejb_interface']
== EJB Interface

Starting with version 6.1, the Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite execution engine supports an EJB interface for accessing `KieSession` and `TaskService` remotely. This enables close transaction integration between the execution engine and remote customer applications.

The implementation of the EJB interface is a single framework-independent and container-agnostic API that can be used with framework-specific code. The services are exposed using the `org.jbpm.services.api` and `org.jbpm.services.ejb` packages. CDI is supported as well through the `org.jbpm.services.cdi` package.

The implementation does not support `RuleService` at the moment, however, the `ProcessService` class exposes an `execute` method that enables you to use various rule-related commands, such as `InsertCommand` and `FireAllRulesCommand`.

[float]
=== Deployment of EJB Client

The EJB interface is supported on Red Hat JBoss EAP only.

Download the *{PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} Maven Repository* ZIP file from the http://access.redhat.com/downloads[Red Hat Customer Portal]. The EJB client is available as a JAR file `jbpm-services-ejb-client-_VERSION_-redhat-_MINOR_VERSION_` in the `maven-repository/org/jbpm/jbpm-services-ejb-client` directory of the downloaded file.

NOTE: The inclusion of EJB does not mean that CDI-based services are replaced. CDI and EJB can be used together, however, it is _not_ recommended. Since EJBs are not available by default in Business Central, the `kie-services` package _must_ be present on the class path. The EJB services are suitable for embedded use cases.

=== EJB Interface Artifacts

The artifacts that provide the EJB interface to the jBPM services are contained in the following packages:

. `org.jbpm.services.ejb.api`: the extension of the Services API for the needs of the EJB interface.
. `org.jbpm.services.ejb.impl`: EJB wrappers on top of the core service implementation.
. `org.jbpm.services.ejb.client`: the EJB remote client implementation. The implementation is supported on Red Hat JBoss EAP only.

The `org.jbpm.services.ejb.api` package mentioned above contains the following service interfaces that can be used by remote EJB clients:

* `DefinitionServiceEJBRemote`: use this interface to gather information about processes (ID, name, and version), process variables (name and type), defined reusable subprocesses, domain-specific services, user tasks, and user tasks inputs and outputs.
* `DeploymentServiceEJBRemote`: use this interface to initiate deployments and undeployments. Methods include `deploy`, `undeploy`, `getRuntimeManager`, `getDeployedUnits`, `isDeployed`, `activate`, `deactivate`, and `getDeployedUnit`. Calling the `deploy` method with an instance of `DeploymentUnit` deploys the unit into the runtime engine by building a `RuntimeManager` instance. After a successful deployment, an instance of `DeployedUnit` is created and cached for further usage.
+
To use the methods mentioned above, the artifacts of the project must be installed in a Maven repository.
* `ProcessServiceEJBRemote`: use this interface to control a lifecycle of one or more processes and work items.
* `RuntimeDataServiceEJBRemote`: use this interface to retrieve data related to the runtime: process instances, process definitions, node instance information, and variable information. The interface includes several convenience methods for gathering task information based on owner, status, and time.
* `UserTaskServiceEJBRemote`: use this interface to control a lifecycle of a user task. The included methods are for example `activate`, `start`, `stop`, and `execute`.
* `QueryServiceEJBRemote`: provides advanced query capabilities.
* `ProcessInstanceMigrationServiceEJBRemote`: provides a migration service for process instances. If a new version of a process definition is deployed and the active process instances should be migrated, use this interface to do so.

A synchronization service that synchronizes the information between Business Central and EJBs is available as well. The synchronization interval can be set using the `org.jbpm.deploy.sync.int` system property. However, note that you have to wait for the service to finish the synchronization before trying to access the updated information using REST.

[NOTE]
====
When you deploy the jBPM services EJB API, the executor is registered during the deployment of a kJAR. Hence the JNDI name used is only visible for the module where the EJB is deployed. If you want to use the executor service from a different module, use the `org.jbpm.executor.service.ejb-jndi` system property that enables you to configure the executor service JNDI name. For more information, see the {URL_ADMIN_GUIDE}#list_of_system_properties[List of System Properties] section of the _{ADMIN_GUIDE}_.

[id='_generating_the_ejb_services_war']
=== Generating EJB Services WAR File

Follow the procedure below to create an EJB Services WAR file using the EJB interface.

. Register a Human Task callback using a startup class:
+
[source]
----
@Singleton
@Startup
public class StartupBean {

  @PostConstruct
  public void init()
  { System.setProperty("org.jbpm.ht.callback", "jaas"); }

}
----

. Run the following command to generate the WAR file:
+
[source]
----
mvn assembly:assembly
----

. Deploy the generated WAR file `sample-war-ejb-app.war` on the Red Hat JBoss EAP instance where Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite is running.
+
[WARNING]
====
If you are deploying the EJB WAR file on the same Red Hat JBoss EAP instance, avoid using the `Singleton` strategy for your runtime sessions. The `Singleton` strategy causes both applications to load the same `ksession` instance from the underlying file system and causes optimistic lock exceptions.
====
+
If you want to deploy the file on a Red Hat JBoss EAP instance separate from the one where Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite is running:
+
  * Configure your application or the application server to invoke a remote EJB.
  * Configure your application or the application server to propagate the security context.
+
If you are using Hibernate to create a database schema for jBPM, update the `persistence.xml` file in Business Central. Edit the `hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto` property and set its value to `update` instead of `create`.

. To test it, create a simple web application and inject the EJB Services:
+
[source]
----
@EJB(lookup = "ejb:/sample-war-ejb-app/ProcessServiceEJBImpl!org.jbpm.services.ejb.api.ProcessServiceEJBRemote")
private ProcessServiceEJBRemote processService;

@EJB(lookup = "ejb:/sample-war-ejb-app/UserTaskServiceEJBImpl!org.jbpm.services.ejb.api.UserTaskServiceEJBRemote")
private UserTaskServiceEJBRemote userTaskService;

@EJB(lookup = "ejb:/sample-war-ejb-app/RuntimeDataServiceEJBImpl!org.jbpm.services.ejb.api.RuntimeDataServiceEJBRemote")
private RuntimeDataServiceEJBRemote runtimeDataService;
----

For more information about invoking remote EJBs, see the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/JBoss_Enterprise_Application_Platform/6.4/html/Development_Guide/sect-Invoking_Session_Beans.html[Invoking Session Beans] chapter of the _Red Hat JBoss EAP Development Guide_.

[id='_sect_remote_java_api']
== Remote Java API

The Remote Java API provides `KieSession`, `TaskService`, and `AuditService` interfaces to the JMS and REST APIs.

The interface implementations provided by the Remote Java API incorporate the underlying logic needed to communicate with the JMS or REST APIs. In other words, these implementations allow you to interact with Business Central through the known interfaces such as the `KieSession` or `TaskService` interface, without having to deal with the underlying transport and serialization details.

[IMPORTANT]
.The Remote Java API Provides Clients, Not Instances
====
While the `KieSession`, `TaskService`, and `AuditService` instances provided by the Remote Java API may "look" and "feel" like local instances of the same interfaces, make sure to remember that these instances are only wrappers around a REST or JMS client that interacts with a remote REST or JMS API.

This means that if a requested operation fails on the _server_, the Remote Java API client instance on the _client_ side will throw `RuntimeException` indicating that the REST call failed. This is different from the behavior of a "real" (or local) instance of a `KieSession`, `TaskService`, and `AuditService` instance: the exception the local instances will throw will relate to how the operation failed. Also, while local instances require different handling, such as having to dispose of `KieSession`, client instances provided by the Remote Java API hold no state and thus do not require any special handling.

Lastly, operations on a Remote Java API client instance that would normally throw other exceptions, such as the `TaskService.claim(taskId, userId)` operation when called by a user who is not a potential owner, will now throw `RuntimeException` instead when the requested operation fails on the _server_.
====

NOTE: It is recommended to use {KIE_SERVER} instead of Business Central. {KIE_SERVER} provides more intuitive and easier way to use the Java Client API. See <<_rest_api_overview>>.

The very first step in interacting with the remote runtime is to create the `RemoteRuntimeEngine` instance. The recommended way is to use `RemoteRestRuntimeEngineBuilder` or `RemoteJmsRuntimeEngineBuilder`. There is a number of different methods for both the JMS and REST client builders that allow the configuration of parameters such as the base URL of the REST API, JMS queue location, or timeout while waiting for responses.

.Procedure: Creating `RemoteRuntimeEngine` Instance
. Instantiate the `RemoteRestRuntimeEngineBuilder` or `RemoteJmsRuntimeEngineBuilder` by calling either `RemoteRuntimeEngineFactory.newRestBuilder()` or `RemoteRuntimeEngineFactory.newJmsBuilder()`.
. Set the required parameters.
. Finally, call the `build()` method.

Detailed examples can be found in <<_the_rest_remote_java_runtimeengine_factory>>, <<_calling_tasks_without_deployment_id>>, and <<_custom_model_objects_and_remote_api>>.

Once the `RemoteRuntimeEngine` instance has been created, there are a couple of methods that can be used to instantiate the client classes you want to use:

[float]
=== Remote Java API Methods

`KieSession RemoteRuntimeEngine.getKieSession()`::
This method instantiates a new (client) `KieSession` instance.

`TaskService RemoteRuntimeEngine.getTaskService()`::
This method instantiates a new (client) `TaskService` instance.

A`uditService RemoteRuntimeEngine.getAuditService()`::
This method instantiates a new (client) `AuditService` instance.

[float]
=== Starting Project: Adding Dependencies

To start your own project, specify the {PRODUCT} BOM in the project's `pom.xml` file. Also, make sure you add the `kie-remote-client` dependency. See the following example:

----
For the supported Maven BOM version, see {URL_INSTALLATION_GUIDE}#supported_comps[Supported Component Versions] of the _{INSTALLATION_GUIDE}_.

[id='_common_remoteruntimeenginebuilder_configuration']
=== Common Configuration

The following common methods can be called on both `RemoteRestRuntimeEngineBuilder` and `RemoteJmsRuntimeEngineBuilder` when creating a new instance of `RemoteRuntimeEngine`:

addUrl(java.net.URL param)::
URL of the deployed Business Central. For example `http://localhost:8080/business-central/`.

addUserName(String param)::
The password to access the REST API.

addPassword(String param)::
The password to access the REST API.

addDeploymentId(String param)::
The name (ID) of the deployment the `RuntimeEngine` must interact with. This can be an empty `String` in case you are only interested in task operations.

addTimeout(int param)::
The maximum number of seconds the engine must wait for a response from the server.

addProcessInstanceId(long param)::
The method that adds the process instance ID, which may be necessary when interacting with deployments that employ the per process instance runtime strategy.

addExtraJaxbClasses(MyClass.class)::
The method that adds extra classes to the class path available to the serialization mechanisms. When passing instances of user-defined classes in a Remote Java API call, it is important to have added the classes using this method first so that the class instances can be serialized correctly.

clearJaxbClasses()::
If `RemoteRuntimeEngineBuilder` is being reused to build multiple instances of `RemoteRuntimeEngineFactory`, this method can be called between `build()` methods to reset the list of user-defined classes being used by the builder.

addCorrelationProperties(String[] params)::
Adds the correlation key properties which are necessary when interacting with a correlation-key identitied `KieSession`.

clearCorrelationProperties()::
Clears all the correlation key properties added by the `addCorrelationProperties` method.

[id='_the_rest_remote_java_runtimeengine_factory']
=== REST Client

The `RemoteRuntimeEngineFactory` class is the starting point for building and configuring a new `RemoteRuntimeEngine` instance that can interact with the Remote API. This class creates an instance of a REST client builder using the `newRestBuilder()` method. This builder is then used to create a `RemoteRuntimeEngine` instance that acts as a client to the remote REST API.

In addition to the methods mentioned in <<_common_remoteruntimeenginebuilder_configuration>>, the following configuration methods can be called on `RemoteRestRuntimeEngineBuilder`:

addUrl(java.net.URL param)::
Configures a URL of the deployed Business Central. For example `http://localhost:8080/business-central/`.

disableTaskSecurity()::
Allows an authenticated user to work on tasks on behalf of other users.
+
This requires the `org.kie.task.insecure` property to be set to `true` on the server side as well.

addHeader(String param1, String param2)::
Adds a custom HTTP header field that will be sent with each request.
+
Multiple calls to this method with the same header field name will _not_ replace existing header fields with the same header field name.

clearHeaderFields()::
Clears all custom header fields for this builder.


Once you have configured all the necessary properties, call `build()` to get access to `RemoteRuntimeEngine`.

IMPORTANT: If the REST API access control is turned on, which is done by default, the given user who wants to use `RemoteRuntimeEngine` calls has to have the `rest-client` and `rest-all` roles assigned.

The following example illustrates how the Remote Java API can be used with the REST API.

[source,java]
----
package org.kie.remote.client.documentation;

import java.net.URL;
import java.util.List;

import org.kie.api.runtime.KieSession;
import org.kie.api.runtime.manager.RuntimeEngine;
import org.kie.api.runtime.process.ProcessInstance;
import org.kie.api.task.TaskService;
import org.kie.api.task.model.TaskSummary;
import org.kie.remote.client.api.RemoteRuntimeEngineFactory;

public class RemoteJavaApiRestClientExample {

 public void startProcessAndStartTask(URL baseUrl, String deploymentId, String user, String password) {

   // The baseUrl should contain a URL similar to
   // "http://localhost:8080/business-central/".

   // RuntimeEngine instance with the necessary information to communicate
   // with the REST services.

   // Select a user with the rest-all role.

   RuntimeEngine engine = RemoteRuntimeEngineFactory
     .newRestBuilder()
     .addDeploymentId(deploymentId)
     .addUrl(baseUrl)
     .addUserName(user)
     .addPassword(password)
     .build();

       // Create KieSession and TaskService instances and use them:
       KieSession ksession = engine.getKieSession();
       TaskService taskService = engine.getTaskService();

       // Each operation on a KieSession, TaskService, or AuditLogService (client) instance
       // sends a request for the operation to the server side and waits for the response.
       // If something goes wrong on the server side, the client will throw an exception.
       ProcessInstance processInstance = ksession.startProcess("com.burns.reactor.maintenance.cycle");
       long procId = processInstance.getId();

       String taskUserId = user;
       taskService = engine.getTaskService();
       List<TaskSummary> tasks = taskService.getTasksAssignedAsPotentialOwner(user, "en-UK");

       long taskId = -1;
       for (TaskSummary task : tasks) {
           if (task.getProcessInstanceId() == procId) {
               taskId = task.getId();
           }
       }

       if (taskId == -1) {
           throw new IllegalStateException("Unable to find task for " + user + " in process instance " + procId);
       }

       taskService.start(taskId, taskUserId);
   }
 }
}
----

==== Retrieving Potential Owners of Human Task
To guarantee high performance, the `getPotentialOwners()` method of the `TaskSummary` class does not return the list of potential owners of a task.

Instead, you should retrieve information about owners on an individual task basis. In the following example, the mentioned `Task` is from the `org.kie.api.task.model.Task` package. Also notice that the method `getTaskById()` uses the task ID as a parameter.

[source,java]
----
import org.kie.api.task.model.OrganizationalEntity;
import org.kie.api.task.model.Task;

public List<OrganizationalEntity> getPotentialOwnersByTaskId(long taskId) {
    Task task = taskService.getTaskById(taskId);
    return task.getPeopleAssignments().getPotentialOwners();
}
----

In addition, actual owners and users created by them can be retrieved using the `getActualOwnerId()` and `getCreatedById()` methods.

For a list of Maven dependencies, see <<_embedded_jbpm_engine_dependencies>>.

[id='_calling_tasks_without_deployment_id']
==== Calling Tasks Without Deployment ID

The `addDeploymentId()` method called on the instance of `RemoteRuntimeEngineBuilder` requires the calling application to pass the `deploymentId` parameter to connect to Business Central. The `deploymentId` is the ID of the deployment with which the `RuntimeEngine` interacts. However, there may be applications that require working with human tasks and dealing with processes across multiple deployments. In such cases, where providing `deploymentId` parameters for multiple deployments to connect to Business Central is not feasible, it is possible to skip the parameter when using the fluent API of `RemoteRestRuntimeEngineBuilder`.

This API does not require the calling application to pass the `deploymentId` parameter. If a request requires the `deploymentId` parameter, but does not have it configured, an exception is thrown.

[id='_custom_model_objects_and_remote_api']
==== Custom Model Objects and Remote API

Working with custom model objects from a client application using the Remote API is supported in Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite. Custom model objects can be created using the Data Modeler in Business Central. Once built and deployed successfully into a project, these objects are part of the project in the local Maven repository.

NOTE: Reuse model objects instead of recreating them locally in the client application.

The process to access and manipulate these objects from a client application follows.

.Procedure: Accessing Custom Model Objects Using Remote API
. Ensure that the custom model objects have been installed into the local Maven repository of the project that they are a part of. To achieve that, the project has to be built successfully.

. If your client application is a Maven-based project, include project the custom model objects as a Maven dependency in the `pom.xml` configuration file of the client application.
+
To find the Maven GAV of the project: in Business Central, go to *Authoring* -> *Project Authoring* and *Tools* -> *Project Editor*.

If the client application is _not_ a Maven-based project, download the Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite project which includes the model classes: in Business Central, go to *Authoring* -> *Artifact Repository*. Add this JAR file of the project on the build path of your client application.

. You can now use the custom model objects in your client application and invoke methods on them using the Remote API. See the following example with a `Person` custom model object.

Ensure that your client application has imported the correct Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite libraries for the example to work.

If you are creating a data object, make sure that the class has the `@org.kie.api.remote.Remotable` annotation. The `@org.kie.api.remote.Remotable` annotation makes the entity available for use with JBoss BPM Suite remote services such as REST, JMS, and WS.

There are two ways to add the annotation:

. On the *Drools & jBPM* screen of the data object in Business Central, select the *Remotable* check box.
+
You can also add the annotation manually. On the right side of the Data Object editor screen in Business Central, choose the *Advanced* tab and click *add annotation*. In the *Add new annotation* dialog window, define the annotation class name as `org.kie.api.remote.Remotable` and click the search button.

. It is also possible to edit the source of the class directly. See the following example:
+
[source,java]
----
package org.bpms.helloworld;

@org.kie.api.remote.Remotable

public class Person implements java.io.Serializable {
	...

}

[id='_the_jms_remote_java_runtimeengine_factory']
=== JMS Client

`RemoteRuntimeEngineFactory` works similarly as the REST variation: it is a starting point for building and configuring a new `RemoteRuntimeEngine` instance that can interact with the remote JMS API. The main use for this class is to create a builder instance of JMS using the `newJmsBuilder()` method. The builder is then used to create a `RemoteRuntimeEngine` instance that will act as a client to the remote JMS API.

In addition to methods mentioned in <<_common_remoteruntimeenginebuilder_configuration>>, the following configuration methods can be called on `RemoteJmsRuntimeEngineBuilder`:

addRemoteInitialContext(javax.jms.InitialContext param)::
A remote `InitialContext` instance from the server, created using JNDI.

addConnectionFactory(javax.jms.ConnectionFactory param)::
A `ConnectionFactory` instance used to connect to `KieSessionQueue` or `TaskServiceQueue`.

addKieSessionQueue(javax.jms.Queue param)::
Sets the JMS queue for requests related to a process instance.

addTaskServiceQueue(javax.jms.Queue param)::
Sets the JMS queue for requests related to the task service usage.

addResponseQueue(javax.jms.Queue param)::
Sets a JMS queue used for receiving responses.

addJbossServerHostName(String param)::
Sets a host name to look up and retrieve a remote instance of `InitialContext`.

addHostName(String param)::
Sets a host name of JMS queues.

addJmsConnectorPort(int param)::
Sets a port for the JMS Connector.

addKeystorePassword(String param)::
Sets a JMS Keystore password.

addKeystoreLocation(String param)::
Specifies a JMS Keystore location.

addTruststorePassword(String param)::
Sets a JMS Truststore password.

addTruststoreLocation(String param)::
Specifies a JMS Truststore location.

useKeystoreAsTruststore()::
Configures the client to use the same file for both Keystore and Truststore.

useSsl(boolean param)::
Sets whether this client instance uses secured connection.

disableTaskSecurity()::
Turns off SSL usage when communicating with Business Central.
+
Note that disabling task security exposes users to a man-in-the-middle attack, since no encryption will be used when sending a message containing a password.

The following example illustrates how the Remote Java API can be used with the JMS API.

[source,java]
----
import java.net.URL;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;

import org.kie.api.runtime.KieSession;
import org.kie.api.runtime.manager.RuntimeEngine;

import org.kie.api.task.model.TaskSummary;
import org.kie.remote.client.api.RemoteRuntimeEngineFactory;
import org.kie.services.client.builder.objects.MyType;

public class RemoteJavaApiJmsClientExample {

    public void startProcessAndTaskViaJmsRemoteJavaAPI (URL serverUrl, String deploymentId, String user, String password) {
      // The serverURL should contain a URL similar to "http://localhost:8080/business-central".
      // Select a user with the rest-all role.

      // Set up remote JMS runtime engine factory:
      RuntimeEngine engine = RemoteRuntimeEngineFactory
        .newJmsBuilder()
        .addDeploymentId(deploymentId)
        .addJbossServerHostName(serverUrl.getHost())
        .addUserName(user)
        .addPassword(password)
        .build();

        // Interface with JMS API
        KieSession ksession = engine.getKieSession();

        Map<String, Object> params = new HashMap<String, Object>();
        params.put("paramName", new MyType("name", 23));
        ProcessInstance processInstance = ksession.startProcess("com.burns.reactor.maintenance.cycle", params);
        long procId = processInstance.getId();
        TaskService taskService = engine.getTaskService();
        List<Long> tasks = taskService.getTasksByProcessInstanceId(procId);
        taskService.start(tasks.get(0), user);
    }
}
----

[float]
==== Configuration Using InitialContext Instance

When configuring the `RemoteJmsRuntimeEngineBuilder` with an `InitialContext` instance as a parameter, it is necessary to retrieve the (remote) instance of `InitialContext` first from the server. See the following example:

[source,java]
----
private InitialContext getRemoteJbossInitialContext(URL url, String user, String password) {

  Properties initialProps = new Properties();
  initialProps.setProperty(InitialContext.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY, "org.jboss.naming.remote.client.InitialContextFactory");
  String jbossServerHostName = url.getHost();
  initialProps.setProperty(InitialContext.PROVIDER_URL, "remote://"+ jbossServerHostName + ":4447");
  initialProps.setProperty(InitialContext.SECURITY_PRINCIPAL, user);
  initialProps.setProperty(InitialContext.SECURITY_CREDENTIALS, password);

  for (Object keyObj : initialProps.keySet()) {
    String key = (String) keyObj;
    System.setProperty(key, (String) initialProps.get(key));
  }

  try {
    return new InitialContext(initialProps);
  } catch (NamingException e) {
      throw new RemoteCommunicationException("Unable to create "
         + InitialContext.class.getSimpleName(), e);
  }
}
----

You can work with JMS queues directly without using `RemoteRuntimeEngine`. For more information, see the https://access.redhat.com/articles/2182341[How to Use JMS Queues Without the RemoteRuntimeEngine in Red Hat JBoss BPMS] article. However, this approach is not a recommended way to use the provided JMS interface.

== Troubleshooting

[id='_serialization_issues']
=== Serialization Issues

Sometimes, users may wish to pass instances of their own classes as parameters to commands sent in a REST request or JMS message. In order to do this, there are a number of requirements.


. The user-defined class satisfy the following in order to be property serialized and deserialized by the JMS or REST API:
+
** The user-defined class must be correctly annotated with JAXB annotations, including the following:
+
*** The user-defined class must be annotated with a `javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlRootElement` annotation with a non-empty `name` value
*** All fields or getter/setter methods must be annotated with a `javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlElement` or `javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlAttribute` annotations.
+
Furthermore, the following usage of JAXB annotations is recommended:
+
*** Annotate the user-defined class with a `javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlAccessorType` annotation specifying that fields should be used, (`javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlAccessType.FIELD`). This also means that you should annotate the fields (instead of the getter or setter methods) with `@XmlElement` or `@XmlAttribute` annotations.
*** Fields annotated with `@XmlElement` or `@XmlAttribute` annotations should also be annotated with `javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlSchemaType` annotations specifying the type of the field, even if the fields contain primitive values.
*** Use objects to store primitive values. For example, use the `java.lang.Integer` class for storing an integer value, and not the `int` class. This way it will always be obvious if the field is storing a value.
** The user-defined class definition must implement a no-arg constructor.
** Any fields in the user-defined class must either be object primitives (such as a `Long` or `String`) or otherwise be objects that satisfy the first 2 requirements in this list (correct usage of JAXB annotations and a no-arg constructor).

. The class definition must be included in the deployment JAR of the deployment that the JMS message content is meant for.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you create your class definitions from an XSD schema, you may end up creating classes that inconsistently (among classes) refer to a namespace. This inconsistent use of a namespace can end up preventing a these class instance from being correctly deserialized when received as a parameter in a command on the server side.

For example, you may create a class that is used in a BPMN2 process, and add an instance of this class as a parameter when starting the process. While sending the command/operation request (via the Remote (client) Java API) will succeed, the parameter will not be correctly deserialized on the server side, leading the process to eventually throw an exception about an unexpected type for the class.
====

. The sender must set a `deploymentId` string property on the JMS bytes message to the name of the `deploymentId`. This property is necessary in order to be able to load the proper classes from the deployment itself before deserializing the message on the server side.

[NOTE]
.Retrieving Process Variables
====
While _submitting_ an instance of a user-defined class is possible using both the JMS and REST API, _retrieving_ an instance of the process variable is only possible through the REST API.
====

=== Insecure Task Operations

By default, you may only work with tasks as the authenticated user. If you try to claim tasks on behalf of another user, you may get an exception similar to:

[source]
----
PermissionDeniedException thrown with message 'User '[UserImpl:'john']' does not have permissions to execute operation 'Claim' on task id 14'
----

This is caused by the security settings. To bypass the security settings:

. Set the `org.kie.task.insecure=true` property on your server. For example, on Red Hat JBoss EAP, add the following into `_EAP_HOME_/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml`:
+
[source,xml]
----
<system-properties>
  ...
  <property name="org.kie.task.insecure" value="true"/>
  ...
</system-properties>
----
. On the client side, do one of the following:
* Use the `disableTaskSecurity()` method when building the `RuntimeEngine` object:
+
[source,java]
----
RuntimeEngine engine = RemoteRuntimeEngineFactory
  .newRestBuilder()
  .addDeploymentId(deploymentId)
  .addUrl(baseUrl)
  .addUserName(user)
  .addPassword(password)
  .disableTaskSecurity()
  .build();
----
+
* Set the `org.kie.task.insecure` system property to `true`.

If you are still experiencing the exception in your application, configure the `UserGroupCallback` settings. See <<_configuring_usergroupcallback>> for further information.
