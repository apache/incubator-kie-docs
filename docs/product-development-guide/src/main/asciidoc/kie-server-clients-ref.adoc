= Available {KIE_SERVER} clients

The following are some of the Java client services available in the `org.kie.server.client` package. You can use these services to configure your Java applications to interact with the relevant {KIE_SERVER} Java client APIs. When you download the *{PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION_LONG} Add-Ons* distribution from the https://access.redhat.com/jbossnetwork/restricted/listSoftware.html[Red Hat Customer Portal], the client services are found in `~/{PRODUCT_FILE}-add-ons/{PRODUCT_INIT}-{PRODUCT_VERSION}-process-engine/kie-server-client-{MAVEN_ARTIFACT_VERSION}/org/kie/server/client`.

* `JobServicesClient`: Used to schedule, cancel, re-queue, and get job requests.
* `ProcessServicesClient`: Used to start, signal, and abort processes or work items.
* `QueryServicesClient`: Used to query processes, process nodes, and process variables.
* `RuleServicesClient`: Used to send commands to the server to perform rule-related operations (for example, insert objects into the working memory or execute rules).
* `SolverServicesClient`: Used to perform all {PLANNER} operations, such as getting the solver state and the best solution, or disposing of a solver.
* `UserTaskServicesClient`: Used to perform all user-task operations (such as to start, claim, or cancel a task) and query tasks by specified field (such as process instances ID or user).
* `UIServicesClient`: Used to get String representation of forms (XML or JSON) and of the process image (SVG).
* `ProcessAdminServicesClient`: Provides an interface for operations with process instances (found in `~/org/kie/server/client/admin`).
* `UserTaskAdminServicesClient`: Provides an interface for operations with user tasks (found in `~/org/kie/server/client/admin`).

The `getServicesClient` method provides access to any of these clients:

[source,java]
----
RuleServicesClient rulesClient = kieServicesClient.getServicesClient(RuleServicesClient.class);
