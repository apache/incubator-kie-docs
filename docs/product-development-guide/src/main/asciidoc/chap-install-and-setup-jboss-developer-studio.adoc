== Importing Projects from Git Repository into Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio

You can configure Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio to connect to a central Git asset repository. The repository stores rules, models, functions, and processes.

You can either clone a remote Git repository or import a local Git repository.

.Cloning Remote Git Repository
. Select the server from the *Server* tab and click the start icon to start your server.
. Start the Secure Shell server, if not running already, by using the following command. The command is Linux and Mac specific only. On these platforms, if `sshd` has already been started, this command fails. In that case, you may safely ignore this step.
