== Rete Algorithm

The Rete algorithm, invented by Dr. Charles Forgy, describes how to process rules in the production memory to generate an efficient discrimination network. A discrimination network is used to filter data as it propagates through the network. The nodes at the top of the network would have many matches at the beginning and fewer matches at the end. At the bottom of the network are the terminal nodes.

The Rete algorithm defines four basic nodes; _root_ node, _1-input_ node, _2-input_ node, and a _terminal_ node. 

[[_the_rete_root_node]]
[float]
=== Rete Root Node

The root node is where all objects enter the network. From there, the flow continues to the `ObjectTypeNode` node. For example, consider two objects: `Account` and `Order`. Matching every single node against every single object would be inefficient. Thus, the rule engine passes the object only to the nodes that match the object type. The easiest way to do this is to create an `ObjectTypeNode` and have all 1-input and 2-input nodes descend from it.

[[_the_objecttypenode]]
[float]
=== ObjectTypeNode
When an object is asserted, the rule engine retrieves a list of valid `ObjectTypesNodes` using a lookup in a HashMap from the object’s Class; if this list doesn’t exist, the rule engine scans all the `ObjectTypeNodes`, finding valid matches which it caches in the list. This enables the rule engine to match against any class type that matches with an `instanceof()` check.

`ObjectTypeNodes` can propagate to:

* `AlphaNodes`
* `LeftInputAdapterNodes`
*  `BetaNodes`

[[_alphanodes]]
[float]
=== AlphaNodes

`AlphaNodes` are used to evaluate literal conditions, such as `Account.name == "Mr Trout"`. When a rule has multiple literal conditions for a single object type, they are linked together. This means that if an application asserts an `Account` object, it must first satisfy the first literal condition before it can proceed to the next `AlphaNode`. This is known as _IntraElement conditions_. The following diagram shows the `AlphaNode` combinations for `Cheese( name == "cheddar", strength == "strong" )`:

[[_hashing]]
[float]
=== Hashing

The rule engine extends Rete by optimizing the propagation from `ObjectTypeNode` to `AlphaNode` using _hashing_. Each time an `AlphaNode` is added to an `ObjectTypeNode`, it adds the literal value as a key to the HashMap with the `AlphaNode` as the value. When a new instance enters the `ObjectType` node, rather than propagating to each `AlphaNode`, it can instead retrieve the correct `AlphaNode` from the HashMap, which avoids unnecessary literal checks.

[[_betanodes]]
[float]
=== BetaNodes

`BetaNodes` are used to compare two objects and their fields to each other. The objects may be of the same or different types.

Consider two `two-input` nodes, a `JoinNode` and a `NotNode`, both are types of `BetaNodes`. By convention, the `two-input` nodes  are regarded as _left_ and _right_. The left input for a `BetaNode` is generally a list of objects; in the rule engine, this is a Tuple. The right input is a single object. `Two-input` nodes can be used to implement the `exists()` checks.

`BetaNodes` also have memory:

* The left input is called the _Beta Memory_ and remembers all incoming tuples.
* The right input is called the _Alpha Memory_ and remembers all incoming objects.

The rule engine extends Rete by performing _indexing_ on the `BetaNodes`. For example, in case of a `BetaNode` performing a check on a String field, the rule engine can perform a hash lookup on that String value as each object enters the memory. This means when facts enter from the opposite side, instead of iterating over all the facts to find valid joins, we do a lookup returning potentially valid candidates. When a valid join is found, the Tuple is joined with the Object, which is referred to as a partial match, and then propagated to the next node.

image:Join_Node.png[]

To enable the first Object, `Cheese` object in the image above, to enter the network, the rule engine uses a `LeftInputNodeAdapter` node. This takes an Object as an input and propagates a single Object Tuple.

Terminal nodes are used to indicate a single rule having matched all its conditions; at this point, the rule has a full match. A rule with an _or_ conditional disjunctive connective results in subrule generation for each possible logical branch; thus one rule can have multiple terminal nodes.

[[_node_sharing]]
[float]
=== Node Sharing
The rule engine also performs node sharing. Many rules repeat the same patterns, and node sharing enables the rule engine to collapse those patterns so that the rule patterns does not re-evaluate the pattern for every single instance. The following two rules share the first pattern, but not the last:

[source, java]
----
rule
when
  Cheese($cheddar : name == "cheddar")
  $person: Person(favouriteCheese == $cheddar)
then
  System.out.println($person.getName() + "likes cheddar");
end
----
[source, java]
----
rule
when
  Cheese($cheddar : name == "cheddar")
  $person : Person(favouriteCheese != $cheddar)
then
  System.out.println($person.getName() + " does not like cheddar");
end
----

The compiled Rete network shows that the alpha node is shared, but the beta nodes are not. Each beta node has its own `TerminalNode`. If the two rules shared the second pattern, the terminal node would have also been shared.

[[_reteoo]]
[float]
=== ReteOO

[WARNING]
====
The ReteOO algorithm has been discontinued and is not supported since {PRODUCT} version 7.0. Do not use ReteOO in a production environment.
====

ReteOO is an implementation of the Rete algorithm. Because it is an unsupported algorithm in {PRODUCT} 7.0, use the PHREAK algorithm, which iterates on ReteOO and addresses core issues of Rete.

[[_phreak_algorithm]]
== PHREAK Algorithm

The new PHREAK algorithm is evolved from the RETE algorithm. While RETE is considered eager and data oriented, PHREAK on the other hand follows lazy and goal oriented approach. The RETE algorithm does a lot of work during the insert, update and delete actions in order to find partial matches for all rules. In case of PHREAK, this partial matching of rule is delayed deliberately.

The eagerness of RETE algorithm during rule matching wastes a lot of time in case of large systems as it does result in a rule firing eventually. PHREAK algorithm addresses this issue and therefore is able to handle large data more efficiently.

PHREAK is derived from a number of algorithms including the following algorithms: LEAPS, RETE/UL, and Collection-Oriented Match.

In addition to the enhancements listed in the Rete00 algorithm, PHREAK algorithm adds the following set of enhancements:

* Three layers of contextual memory: Node, Segment, and Rule memory types.
* Rule, segment, and node based linking.
* Lazy (delayed) rule evaluation.
* Stack-based evaluations with pause and resume.
* Isolated rule evaluation.
* Set-oriented propagations.

[[_rule_evaluation_with_phreak_algorithm]]
== Rule Evaluation With PHREAK Algorithm

When the rule engine starts, all the rules are unlinked. At this stage, there is no rule evaluation. The insert, update, and delete actions are queued before entering the beta network. The rule engine uses a simple heuristic--based on the rule most likely to result in firings--to calculate and select the next rule for evaluation. This delays the evaluation and firing of the other rules. When a rule has all the right input values populated, it gets linked in; a goal representing this rule is created and placed into a priority queue, which is ordered by salience. Each queue is associated with an `AgendaGroup`. The engine only evaluates rules for the active `AgendaGroup` by inspecting the queue and popping the goal for the rule with the highest salience. This means the work done shifts from the insert, update, delete phase to the `fireAllRules` phase. Only the rule for which the goal was created is evaluated, and other potential rule evaluations are delayed. While individual rules are evaluated, node sharing is still achieved through the process of segmentation.

Unlike the tuple-oriented RETE, the PHREAK propagation is collection-oriented. For the rule that is being evaluated, the engine accesses the first node and processes all queued insert, update, and delete actions. The results are added to a set, and the set is propagated to the child node. In the child node, all queued insert, update, and delete actions are processed, adding the results to the same set. Once finished, this set is propagated to the next child node and the same process repeats until it reaches the terminal node. This creates a batch process effect, which can provide performance advantages for certain rule constructs.

This linking and unlinking of rules happens through a layered bit mask system, based on network segmentation. When the rule network is built, segments are created for nodes that are shared by the same set of rules. A rule itself is made up from a path of segments. In case a rule does not share any node with any other rule, it becomes a single segment.

A bit-mask offset is assigned to each node in the segment. Furthermore, another bit mask is assigned to each segment in the path of the rule according to these rules:

* If there is at least one input, the node's bit is set to the _on_ state.
* If each node in a segment has its bit set to the _on_ state, the segment's bit is also set to the _on_ state.
* If any node's bit is set to the _off_ state, the segment is also set to the _off_ state.
* If each segment in the path of the rule is set to the _on_ state, the rule is said to be linked in, and a goal is created to schedule the rule for evaluation.

The same bit-mask technique is used to also track dirty nodes, segments, and rules. This allows for an already linked rule to be scheduled for evaluation if it has been considered dirty since it was last evaluated. This ensures that no rule will ever evaluate partial matches.

As opposed to a single unit of memory in RETE, PHREAK has three levels of memory. This allows for much more contextual understanding during the evaluation of a rule.

[[_phreak_and_sequential_mode]]
=== PHREAK and Sequential Mode

The sequential mode is supported for the PHREAK algorithm: the `modify` and `update` rule statements are now allowed. Any rule that has not yet been evaluated will have access to data modified by the previous rules that used `modify` or `update`. This results in a more intuitive behavior of the sequential mode.

For example, consider the following rule:

[source,java]
----
rule "Rule1"
salience 100
when
   $fact : MyFact( field1 == false )
then
   System.out.println("Rule1 : " + $fact);
   $fact.setField1(true);
   update($fact);
end


rule "Rule2"
salience 95
when
    $fact : MyFact( field1 == true )
then
    System.out.println("Rule2 : " + $fact);
    update($fact);
end
----

When you insert a `MyFact` with the value `field1==false`:

* The ReteOO algorithm executes only `Rule1`.
* The PHREAK algorithm executes both `Rule1` and `Rule2`.
