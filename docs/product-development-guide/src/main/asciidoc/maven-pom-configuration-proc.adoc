= Configuring Maven using the project configuration file (`pom.xml`)

To use Maven for building and managing your {PRODUCT_DM} and {PRODUCT_BA} projects, you must configure your projects to be built with Maven. To do so, Maven provides the POM file (`pom.xml`) that holds configuration details for your project.

`pom.xml` is an XML file that contains information about the project (such as project name, version, description, developers, mailing list, and license), and build details (such as dependencies, location of the source, test, target directories, repositories, and plug-ins).

When you generate a Maven project, a `pom.xml` file is automatically generated. You can edit `pom.xml` to add more dependencies and new repositories. Maven downloads all of the JAR files and the dependent JAR files from the Maven repository when you compile and package your project.

Find the schema for the `pom.xml` file at http://maven.apache.org/maven-v4_0_0.xsd.

For more information about POM files, see http://maven.apache.org/pom.html[Apache Maven Project POM Reference].
