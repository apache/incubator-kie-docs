= Configuring Maven using the project configuration file (`pom.xml`)

To use Maven for building and managing your {PRODUCT} projects, you must configure your projects to be built with Maven. To do so, Maven provides the POM file (`pom.xml`) that holds configuration details for your project, such as:

* project name
* version
* description
* developers
* mailing list
* license

The `pom.xml` file also contains build details, such as:

* dependencies
* location of the source
* test
* target directories
* repositories
* plug-ins


.Procedure
. Generate a Maven project. A `pom.xml` file is automatically generated when you create a Maven project.
. Edit `pom.xml` to add more dependencies and new repositories. 
+
Maven downloads all of the JAR files and the dependent JAR files from the Maven repository when you compile and package your project.

Find the schema for the `pom.xml` file at http://maven.apache.org/maven-v4_0_0.xsd.

For more information about POM files, see http://maven.apache.org/pom.html[Apache Maven Project POM Reference].
