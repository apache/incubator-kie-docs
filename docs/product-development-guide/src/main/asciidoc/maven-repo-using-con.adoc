= Setting Maven dependencies in your project

{PRODUCT} projects are designed to be used with a {PRODUCT} Maven repository, available online or downloaded from the Red Hat Customer Portal:

* Online {PRODUCT} Maven repository:
+
`https://maven.repository.redhat.com/ga/`
* Downloadable {PRODUCT} Maven repository
+
`http://download.devel.redhat.com/devel/candidates/RHPAM/RHPAM-7.0.0.GA/rhpam-7.0.0.GA-maven-repository.zip`


When you create a project, {CENTRAL} uses the Maven repositories that are configured for {CENTRAL}. However, you can use the Maven global or user settings to direct all {PRODUCT} projects to retrieve dependencies from the public {PRODUCT} repository by modifying the following files:

* The Maven `settings.xml` file. This file is included with the Maven repository available for download from the http://download.devel.redhat.com/devel/candidates/RHPAM/RHPAM-7.0.0.GA/rhpam-7.0.0.GA-maven-repository.zip[Red Hat Customer Portal].
* The Maven Project Object Model (POM) file (`pom.xml`).

For more information about Maven repositories, see the https://maven.apache.org/[Apache Maven Project] documentation.
