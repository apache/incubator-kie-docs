= Setting Maven dependencies in your project

You can use an external Maven repository to deploy a project. When you create a project, {CENTRAL} uses the Maven repositories that are configured for {CENTRAL}. You can use the Maven global or user settings to direct all {PRODUCT} projects to retrieve dependencies from the public {PRODUCT} repository by modifying the following files:

* The Maven `settings.xml` file. 
* The Maven project object model (POM) file (`pom.xml`).
