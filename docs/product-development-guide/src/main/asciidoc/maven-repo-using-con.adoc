= Using the Maven repository in your project

You can direct Maven to us the {EAP} Maven repository in your project in one of the following ways:

* Configure the Project Object Model (POM) file (pom.xml).
* Modify the Maven settings file (settings.xml).

The recommended approach is to direct Maven to use the Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform Maven repository across all projects by using the Maven global or user settings.
COMMENT: if this is the recommended approach then do we need include the section about tje pom.xml file?

{PRODUCT} is designed to be used in combination with Red Hat JBoss Middleware Maven Repository and the Maven Central repository as dependency sources. Ensure that both repositories are available for project builds.
