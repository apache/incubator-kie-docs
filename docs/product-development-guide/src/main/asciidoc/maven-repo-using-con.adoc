= Using the Maven repository in your project

{PRODUCT} is designed to be used in combination with the {PRODUCT} Maven repository. When you create a project in {CENTRAL}, the Maven repository is created and configured automatically. However, if you create a project outside of {CENTRAL} and you want to use a Maven repository with it, you must associate your project with a Maven repository by completing the following tasks:

* Modify the Maven `settings.xml` file. This file is included with the Maven repository available for download from the https://access.redhat.com[Red Hat Customer Portal].
* Configure the Maven Project Object Model (POM) file (`pom.xml`).

Red Hat recommends directing Maven to use the {PRODUCT} Maven repository across all projects by using the Maven global or user settings.
