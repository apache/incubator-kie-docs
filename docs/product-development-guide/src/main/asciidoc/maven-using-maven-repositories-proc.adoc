= Using the Maven Repository in your project

You can direct Maven to use the {EAP_LONG} Maven repository in your project in one of the following ways:

* Configure the Project Object Model (POM) file (`pom.xml`). See xref:maven-pom-configuration-proc[].
* Modify the Maven settings file (`settings.xml`). See xref:maven-settings-configuration-ref[]

The recommended approach is to direct Maven to use the {EAP_LONG} Maven repository across all projects by using the Maven global or user settings.

From version 6.1.0 onwards, {PRODUCT_PAM} and {PRODUCT_DM} are designed to be used in combination with https://maven.repository.redhat.com/ga/[Red Hat JBoss Middleware Maven Repository] and Maven Central repository as dependency sources. Ensure that both repositories are available for project builds.
