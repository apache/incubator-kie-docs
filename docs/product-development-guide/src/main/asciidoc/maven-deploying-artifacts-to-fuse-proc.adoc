= Deploying {PRODUCT} Artifacts to Red Hat JBoss Fuse

Red Hat JBoss Fuse is an open source Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) with an elastic footprint and is based on Apache Karaf. The {PRODUCT_VERSION} version of {PRODUCT} supports deployment of runtime artifacts to Fuse.

With the 6.1 release, {PRODUCT} runtime components (in the form of JARs) are OSGi enabled. The runtime engines JARs `MANIFEST.MF` files describe their dependencies, amongst other things. You can plug these JARs directly into an OSGi environment, like Fuse.

[WARNING]
.POM Parser Limitations in OSGi Environments
====
{PRODUCT} uses a scanner to enable continuous integration, resolution, and fetching of artifacts from remote Maven repositories. This scanner, called KIE-CI, uses a native Maven parser called Plexus to parse Maven POMs. However, this parser is not OSGi compatible and fails to instantiate in an OSGi environment. KIE-CI automatically switches to a simpler POM parser called `MinimalPomParser`.

The `MinimalPomParser` is a very simple POM parser implementation provided by Drools and is limited in what it can parse. It ignores some POM file parts, such as the parent POM of a KJAR. This means that users must not rely on those POM features (such as dependencies declared in the parent POM in their KJARs) when using KIE-CI in an OSGi environment.

=== Separating Assets and Code

One of the main advantage of deploying {PRODUCT} artifacts on Red Hat JBoss Fuse is that each bundle is isolated, running in its own classloader. This allows you to separate the logic (code) from the assets. Business users can produce and change the rules and processes (assets) and package them in their own bundle, keeping them separate from the project bundle (code), created by the developer team. Assets can be updated without needing to change the project code.
