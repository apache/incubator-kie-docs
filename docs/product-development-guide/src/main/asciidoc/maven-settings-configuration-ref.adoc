= Modify the Maven settings file

The Maven settings file (`settings.xml`) is used to configure Maven execution. You can find this file in the following locations:

* `$_M2_HOME_/conf/settings.xml`, where _M2_HOME_ is the Maven installation directory. This file contains global settings.
* `$_USER_HOME_/.m2/settings.xml`, where _USER_HOME_ is the user's home directory. This file contains local, user-defined settings.
* A custom location specified by the `kie.maven.settings.custom` system property .

[NOTE]
====
The settings used are a combination of these files. For more information, see https://maven.apache.org/pom.html[Apache Maven Project].
