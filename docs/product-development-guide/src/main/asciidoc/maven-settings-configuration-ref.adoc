= Configure Maven using the settings file

The Maven settings file (`settings.xml`) is used to configure Maven execution. You can locate this file in the following locations:

* In the Maven install directory at `$_M2_HOME_/conf/settings.xml`. These settings are called global settings.
* In the user's install directory at `$_USER_HOME_/.m2/settings.xml`. These settings are called user settings.
* A custom location specified by the system property `kie.maven.settings.custom`.

NOTE: The settings used is a merge of the files located in these locations.

The following is an example of a Maven `settings.xml` file. Note the `activeByDefault` tag, which specifies the default profile. In the following example, it is a profile with a remote Maven repository.
