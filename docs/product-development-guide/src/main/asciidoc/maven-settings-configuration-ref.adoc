= Configure Maven using the settings file

The Maven settings file (`settings.xml`) is used to configure Maven execution. You can locate this file in the following locations:

* In the Maven install directory at `$_M2_HOME_/conf/settings.xml`. These settings are called global settings.
* In the user's install directory at `$_USER_HOME_/.m2/settings.xml`. These settings are called user settings.
* A custom location specified by the system property `kie.maven.settings.custom`.

[NOTE]
====
The settings used is a merge of the files located in these locations. For more information, see https://maven.apache.org/pom.html[Apache Maven Project].
