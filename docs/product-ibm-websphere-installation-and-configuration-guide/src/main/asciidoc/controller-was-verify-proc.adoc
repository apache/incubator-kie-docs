= Verifying the installation
After you install and start the controller, verify that it works correctly.

.Procedure
In your command terminal, enter the following command to verify that the Controller is working on {WEBSPHERE}:

[source]
----
curl -X GET "http://<HOST>:<PORT>/controller/rest/controller/management/servers" -H  "accept: application/xml" -u '<CONTROLLER>:<CONTROLLER_PWD>'
----

`<HOST>` is the ID or name of the {KIE_SERVER} host, for example, `localhost` or `192.7.8.9`.

`<PORT>` is the port of the {KIE_SERVER} host, for example, `9060`.

`<CONTROLLER>` and `<CONTROLLER_PWD>` are the user credentials that you created in this section.

The command should return information about the {KIE_SERVER} instance.

[NOTE]
====
Alternatively, you can use the {KIE_SERVER} Java API Client to access the Controller.
====

If {KIE_SERVER} is not running, consider stopping and restarting the {WEBSPHERE} instance and try again to access the {KIE_SERVER} URL or API.
