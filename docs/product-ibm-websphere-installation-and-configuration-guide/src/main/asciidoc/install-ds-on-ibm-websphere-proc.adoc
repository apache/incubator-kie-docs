= Installing {KIE_SERVER}

Now that the basic configuration is complete and WAS is ready to deploy {PRODUCT}, you can upload the deployable WAR file that was extracted earlier. The {PRODUCT} ZIP file for WAS contains the deployable WAR file for {KIE_SERVER}.

. Click *Applications* -> *Application Types* -> *WebSphere Enterprise Applications*.
+
This shows you all of the existing applications in the system and enables you to install a new one.

. Click *Install*.
. Upload the {KIE_SERVER} WAR file (`kie-server.war`) from the local file system.
. Select *Fast Path* and click *Next*.
+
The *Install New Application* wizard opens.

. Change the *Application Name* to `kie-server` and click *Next*.
. Map the {KIE_SERVER} modules to servers according to your specific requirements and click *Next*.
. In the *Bind Listeners for Message-Driven Beans*, select *Activation Specification* for both beans and enter `jms/activation/KIE.SERVER.REQUEST` in the *Target Resource JNDI Name* field.
. Enter the `jms/conn/KIE.SERVER.REQUEST` JNDI name for the `KIE.SERVER.REQUEST` connection factory.
. In the *Map Virtual Hosts for Web Modules* section, keep the default values and click *Next*.

== Mapping Groups to Roles

Map the `kie-server` role to a user or a group.

. Go back to the main configuration page for the newly installed `kie-server` application (*Applications* -> *Application Types* -> *WebSphere Enterprise Applications*).
. Click *Security Role to User/Group Mapping* under *Detail Properties*.
. Select the `kie-server` role and click *Map Groups* to search for the `kie-server` group.
. Move the `kie-server` group from the *Available* list to the *Selected* list and click *OK*.

This mapping gives the previously created administrator user access to the {KIE_SERVER}.
. Click *Save* and start the `kie-server` application.

Check whether the {KIE_SERVER} REST API works by sending a GET request at `http://_TARGET_SERVER:PORT_/kie-server/services/rest/server`.
