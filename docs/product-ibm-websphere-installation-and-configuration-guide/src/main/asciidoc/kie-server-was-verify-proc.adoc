= Verifying the installation
After you install {KIE_SERVER} and define the {KIE_SERVER} group mapping, verify that the server is running.

.Prerequisites
* {KIE_SERVER} is installed on the {WEBSPHERE} instance.
* You have set all required environment variables for the {KIE_SERVER} Controller.
* You have defined the {KIE_SERVER} group mapping in {WEBSPHERE}.

.Procedure
Navigate to the {KIE_SERVER} URL `http://<HOST>:<PORT>/kie-server` to verify that the server is running, or send a `GET` request to `http://<HOST>:<PORT>/kie-server/services/rest/server` to check whether the {KIE_SERVER} REST API responds.

`<HOST>` is the ID or name of the {KIE_SERVER} host, for example, `localhost` or `192.7.8.9`.

`<PORT>` is the port of the {KIE_SERVER} host, for example, `9060`.

If {KIE_SERVER} is not running, stop and restart the {WEBSPHERE} instance and try again to access the {KIE_SERVER} URL or API.
