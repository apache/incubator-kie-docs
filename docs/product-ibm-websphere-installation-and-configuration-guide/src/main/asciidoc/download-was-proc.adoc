= Installing WAS

You must download and install IBM Installation Manager before installing WAS.

== Downloading and installing IBM Installation Manager

. Download IBM Installation Manager version 1.8.5 or later from the http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27025142[IBM Installation Manager and Packaging Utility download links] page.
. Extract the downloaded archive, change to root, and run the following command in the new directory:
+
[source]
----
./install
----
+
*IBM Installation Manager* opens. The installer will guide you through the entire process of installing the manager.
. Open the installed manager, go to *File* -> *Preferences* and click *Add Repository*.
+
The *Add Repository* dialog window opens.
. Enter the repository URL for WAS 9.0. You can find all the repository URLs in the https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEQTJ_9.0.0/com.ibm.websphere.installation.nd.doc/ae/cins_repositories.html[Online product repositories for WebSphere Application Server offerings] page of the _IBM Knowledge Center_. For example:
+
[source]
----
http://www.ibm.com/software/repositorymanager/V9WASILAN
----
. Enter your IBM id credentials when prompted and after the *Connection* status turns green, click *OK*.
. Click *Install*.
. Choose the packages you want to install and click *Next*. If asked, install all the recommended fixes as well.

== Creating a WebSphere profile and the WebSphere users
A profile is required to store user configuration and deployed applications. The user is required for login.

From WAS: A profile defines the runtime environment. The profile includes all the files that the server processes in the runtime environment and that you can change.

 ./manageprofiles.sh -create -profileName testprofile -adminUserName websphere -adminPassword websphere

== Creating users and installation verification - Delete this section if the previous one works. Or, is this simply a step to verify as noted in the last step of this section?

. In the *WebSphere Customization Toolbox 9.0*, open the *Profile Management Tool*.
. Click *Create...* and create a user for the *Application Server* environment.
. In the *WebSphere Application Server - First Steps* window that opens, click *Installation Verification* and verify that your server was installed properly.

== Starting the server
. Change into the `bin` directory of the installed application server (by default at `/opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer`).
. Change to root and run `./startServer.sh _APPLICATION_SERVER_NAME_`, for example:
+
[source]
----
./startServer.sh server1
----
. Navigate to `http://_TARGET_SERVER_:9060/ibm/console` in your web browser and log in with the user credentials created in the previous procedure.
+
The *Integrated Solutions Console* opens.

[NOTE]
====
Do not forget to stop the server after you are no longer using it. Log out of the console and run `./stopServer.sh _APPLICATION_SERVER_NAME_` as root. For example:

[source]
----
./stopServer.sh server1
----
