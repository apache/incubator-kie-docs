== Creating a WebSphere profile and user name
A profile defines the run time environment. The profile includes all the files that the server processes in the run time environment and that you can change. The user is required for login. In this example, we will use `websphere` for both the user name and password.

. From your terminal, navigate to the WebSphere Application Server folder location that you specified during the installation.
. Change to the `/bin` directory and run the following command:
+
[source]
----
sudo ./manageprofiles.sh -create -profileName testprofile -adminUserName websphere -adminPassword websphere
----

== Starting the server
. From your terminal, navigate to the WebSphere Application Server folder location that you specified during installation.
. Change to the `/profiles/testprofile/bin` directory and run the following command:
+
[source]
----
sudo ./startServer.sh server1
----
. Navigate to `http://_TARGET_SERVER_:9060/ibm/console` in your web browser and log in with the user credentials created in the previous procedure. For example: `http://localhost:9060/ibm/console`.

The *WebSphere Integrated Solutions Console* opens.
