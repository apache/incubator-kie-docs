//* emmurphy> OK, so the section Karel is talking about is here:
//* <emmurphy> http://file.ork.redhat.com/~emmurphy/BXMSDOC-2222a/#install-dc-standalone-proc
//* <emmurphy> But I need to ask him if there are any tweaks for WLS or WAS.
//* Its how you can use DS if you don't use EAP. We only support DS on EAP except for this standalone method.
//* Red Hat Decision Manager has two parts: Decision Central and Decision Server.
//* You can install both DC and DS on JBoss EAP (our product).
//* You can also install DS on a WLS, WAS, and JBoss Web Server.
//* BUT you cannot install DC on those platforms.
//* You can run projects that you created on EAP on DS on those other platforms.
