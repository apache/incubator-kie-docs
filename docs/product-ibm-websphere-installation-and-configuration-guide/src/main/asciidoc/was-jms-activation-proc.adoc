= Create JMS activation specifications

A JMS activation specification is required in order to bridge the queue and the message-driven bean that enables JMS.

.Prerequisites
* You have created a service bus for {WEBSPHERE}.
* You have created JMS queues.

.Procedure
. In the WebSphere Integrated Solutions Console, navigate to *Resources* -> *JMS* -> *Activation Specifications*.
. Select the correct scope and click *New*.
. Select the *Default Messaging Provider* option and click *OK*.
. For each of the following required activation specifications, enter the name of the activation specification (for example, `KIE.SERVER.REQUEST`) and the JNDI name (for example, `jms/activation/KIE.SERVER.REQUEST`), and then select the service bus from the *Bus Name* drop-down list.
. From the *Destination Type* drop-down list, select *Queue* and enter the name of the corresponding queue as a *Destination lookup* (for example, `jms/KIE.SERVER.REQUEST`).
. Click *Apply* and *Save* to save the changes to the master configuration, and repeat for each required activation specification.
