== Increasing JVM Heap Size

With the default JVM heap size, the IBM WebSphere Application Server freezes or causes deployment errors when deploying Business Central. To increase the heap size:

. In the *Integrated Solutions Console*, go to *Servers* -> *Server Types* -> *WebSphere Application Servers*.
. In the list of application servers, click on the server on which you are going to deploy Business Central. For example `server1`.
+
The configuration page for that server opens.
. Under *Server Infrastructure* heading on the right side, click *Java and Process Management* -> *Process Definition*.
+
.Application Server Configuration Page
image::process_definition.png[]
. Click *Java Virtual Machine* under the *Additional Properties* heading on the right.
+
.Process Definition Configuration Page
image::process_definition2.png[]
+
This will open up the configuration properties for the JVM that is used to start the server.
. Change both the *Initial Heap Size* and *Maximum Heap Size* to `2048`. This is the configuration {PRODUCT} is tested with.
+
.JVM Configuration Page
image::process_definition3.png[]
. Click *Apply* at the bottom.

Make sure that the selected *User ID* does _not_ conflict with any known title of a role or a group.

For example, if there is a role called `admin`, you should _not_ create a user with the user name `admin`.
====
+
.Create User Dialog Window
image::creating_user.png[]

. Click *Group Membership* and assign the user to the `admin` group that you created previously.
+
[NOTE]
====
You may assign this user to any of the groups you have just created. In the production systems, you are likely to create separate users for separate groups that align with business roles. The `admin` group is all encompassing and is therefore useful for the purposes of this setup.
====

. Click *Create*.

== Session Management Custom Settings

. In the main menu on the left, go to *Servers* -> *Server Types* -> *WebSphere Application Servers* and select the server on which you are deploying Business Central.

== Configuring LDAP Principal and Role Names Matching Criteria

The client applications using ssh to interact with the git server bundled with Business Central are authenticated and authorised to perform git operations using the security API offered by the Uberfire server. If your {PRODUCT} application is deployed on WebSphere Application Server (WAS) using an LDAP security realm, the git clients may not be authorized as expected. This is because the distinguished name (DN) for the principal (user or group name) assigned by WAS is the more complex DN associated with that principal by LDAP, which leads to a mismatch of names when the Uberfire server tries to map the roles.
To ensure that the role mapping does not fail, use the system property `org.uberfire.ldap.regex.role_mapper` to control the matching criteria of LDAP principal to role names.


The system property `org.uberfire.ldap.regex.role_mapper` is a regex pattern used to map LDAP principal names to application role names. Ensure that this pattern contains the variable `role` as it is substited by the application role name when matching a principal value to the role name. Only after the pattern is matched, the role is added to the user.

For example, if the distinguished name (DN) for the admin group in LDAP is `cn=admin,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com` and the intended role is `admin`, then setting the following value for property `org.uberfire.ldap.regex.role_mapper` finds a match on `admin` role:
