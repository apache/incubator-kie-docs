= Verifying the installation
After you install the headless Process Automation Manager controller and define the required system properties and role requirements on the application server, verify that the headless Process Automation Manager controller works correctly.

.Prerequisites
* {KIE_SERVER} and the headless Process Automation Manager controller are installed on the application server instance.
* You have set all required system properties and role requirements for the headless Process Automation Manager controller on the application server.

.Procedure
In your command terminal, enter the following command to verify that the controller is working:

[source]
----
curl -X GET "http://<HOST>:<PORT>/controller/rest/controller/management/servers" -H  "accept: application/xml" -u '<CONTROLLER>:<CONTROLLER_PWD>'
----

`<HOST>` is the ID or name of the {KIE_SERVER} host, for example, `localhost` or `192.7.8.9`.

`<PORT>` is the port of the {KIE_SERVER} host, for example, `7001`.

`<CONTROLLER>` and `<CONTROLLER_PWD>` are the user credentials that you created in this section.

The command should return information about the {KIE_SERVER} instance.

[NOTE]
====
Alternatively, you can use the {KIE_SERVER} Java API Client to access the controller.
====

If the headless Process Automation Manager controller is not running, stop and restart the application server instance and try again to access the headless Process Automation Manager controller URL or API.
