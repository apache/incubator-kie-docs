=== Creating JMS connection factories

To send and receive messages from {KIE_SERVER}, you must create the JMS connection factories. Connection factories are required for establishing connections when sending messages into queues.

ifdef::BA[]
For Business Central, create the following connection factories: `KIE.SIGNAL`, `KIE.INPUT` (for queries), `KIE.RESPONSE.ALL` (for responses), and `KIE.EXECUTOR` (for the executor).

If you will be installing the {KIE_SERVER} as well, you need to create `KIE.SERVER.REQUEST`, `KIE.SERVER.RESPONSE`, and `KIE.SERVER.EXECUTOR` connection factories.
endif::BA[]

ifdef::DM[]
Create the `KIE.SERVER.REQUEST` and `KIE.SERVER.RESPONSE` connection factories.
endif::DM[]

NOTE: The factory names shown above are suggestions only and you can change them to suit your needs and company guidelines.

. Click *Resources* -> *JMS* -> *Connection Factories*.
. Select the correct scope and click *New*.
. Select the *Default Messaging Provider* option and click *OK*.
ifdef::BA[]
. Enter the name and JNDI name of the factory. For example:
+
  ** *Name*: `KIE.SIGNAL`
  ** *JNDI name*: `jms/conn/KIE.SIGNAL`
+
[NOTE]
====
The JNDI names for `KIE.INPUT`, `KIE.RESPONSE.ALL`, and `KIE.EXECUTOR` are `jms/conn/KIE.INPUT`, `jms/conn/KIE.RESPONSE.ALL`, and `jms/conn/KIE.EXECUTOR` respectively.
====
endif::BA[]
ifdef::DM[]
. Enter the name and the JNDI name of the factory. For example:
+
  ** *Name*: `KIE.SERVER.REQUEST`
  ** *JNDI name*: `jms/conn/KIE.SERVER.REQUEST`
+
[NOTE]
====
The JNDI name for `KIE.SERVER.RESPONSE` is `jms/conn/KIE.SERVER.RESPONSE`.
====
endif::DM[]
. Select the service bus from the *Bus Name* drop-down list.
+
Leave the default values for the remaining options.
. Click *Apply* and *Save* to save the changes to the master configuration.

=== Creating JMS queues

JMS queues are the destination end points for point-to-point messaging.

ifdef::BA[]
For {PRODUCT}, create the following queues: `KIE.RESPONSE.ALL` (for responses), `KIE.AUDIT` (for asynchronous audit logs), `KIE.SESSION` (for `ksession`-based operations), `KIE.TASK` (for task-based operations), `KIE.EXECUTOR` (for Business Central executor services), and `KIE.SIGNAL` (for sending external global signals to processes).

For {KIE_SERVER}, create the following: `KIE.SERVER.REQUEST` (for requests), `KIE.SERVER.RESPONSE` (for responses), and `KIE.SERVER.EXECUTOR` (for executor services).
endif::BA[]

ifdef::DM[]
Create the `KIE.SERVER.REQUEST` (for requests) and `KIE.SERVER.RESPONSE` (for responses) queues.

//IMPORTANT: To prevent warnings in the log, create `KIE.EXECUTOR` queue as well.
endif::DM[]

. Click *Resources* -> *JMS* -> *Queues*.
. Select the correct scope and click *New*.
. Select the *Default Messaging Provider* option and click *OK*.

ifdef::BA[]
. Enter the name and the JNDI name of the queue, for example:
+
  ** *Name*: `KIE.RESPONSE.ALL`
  ** *JNDI name*: `jms/KIE.RESPONSE.ALL`
+
[NOTE]
====
All of the JNDI names of other queues follow the same convention as the example above.
====
endif::BA[]
ifdef::DM[]
. Enter the name and the JNDI name of the queue, for example:
+
  ** *Name*: `KIE.SERVER.REQUEST`
  ** *JNDI name*: `jms/KIE.SERVER.REQUEST`
+
[NOTE]
====
All of the JNDI names follow the same convention as the example above.
====
endif::DM[]
. From the *Bus Name* drop-down list, select the service bus created earlier.
. From the *Queue Name* drop-down list, select the *Create Service Integration Bus Destination*.
+
The *Create New Queue* form opens to assist you with creating a new service integration bus.
. Enter a unique identifier and select the bus member that you created earlier.
. Click *Apply* and *Save* to save the changes to the master configuration.

=== Creating JMS activation specifications

A JMS activation specification is required and is the bridge between the queue and the message-driven bean.

ifdef::BA[]
For Business Central, create the following activation specifications: `KIE.RESPONSE.ALL` (for responses), `KIE.AUDIT` (for asynchronous audit logs), `KIE.SESSION` (for `ksession`-based operations), `KIE.TASK` (for task-based operations), `KIE.EXECUTOR` (for Business Central executor services), and `KIE.SIGNAL` (for sending external global signals to processes).

For {KIE_SERVER}, create the following: `KIE.SERVER.REQUEST` (for requests) and `KIE.SERVER.RESPONSE` (for responses), and `KIE.SERVER.EXECUTOR` (for executor services).
endif::BA[]

ifdef::DM[]
For {KIE_SERVER}, create the `KIE.SERVER.REQUEST` (for requests) and  `KIE.SERVER.RESPONSE` (for responses) activation specifications.

//IMPORTANT: To prevent warnings in the log, create `KIE.EXECUTOR` activation specification as well.
endif::DM[]

. Click *Resources* -> *JMS* -> *Activation Specifications*.
. Select the correct scope and click *New*.
. Select the *Default Messaging Provider* option and click *OK*.

ifdef::BA[]
. Enter the name and the JNDI name of the activation specification, for example:
+
  ** *Name*: `KIE.RESPONSE.ALL`
  ** *JNDI name*: `jms/activation/KIE.RESPONSE.ALL`
+
[NOTE]
====
All of the JNDI names of other activation specifications follow the same convention as the example above.
====
. From the *Destination Type* drop-down, select *Queue*.
. Enter the *Destination lookup*. For example `jms/KIE.RESPONSE.ALL`.
endif::BA[]
ifdef::DM[]
. Enter the name and the JNDI name of the activation specification, for example:
+
  ** *Name*: `KIE.SERVER.REQUEST`
  ** *JNDI name*: `jms/activation/KIE.SERVER.REQUEST`
+
[NOTE]
====
All of the JNDI names of other activation specifications follow the same convention as the example above.
====
. From the *Destination Type* drop-down list, select *Queue*.
. Enter the *Destination lookup* (as created in the previous procedure), for example `jms/KIE.SERVER.REQUEST`.
endif::DM[]

. Select the service bus from the *Bus Name* drop-down list.
+
Leave the default values for the remaining options.
. Click *Apply* and *Save* to save the changes to the master configuration.

. Click *Custom Properties* under *Additional Properties*.
. Create the following properties by clicking *New* -> *Custom JVM Properties*.

+
[cols="1,1,2a", options="header"]
.Required properties for {KIE_SERVER}
|===
|Name
|Value
|Description

|`org.jboss.logging.provider`
|`jdk`
|This property is only required where a `CA SiteMinder TAI (SMTAI)` is installed in the environment. Using this property forces Hibernate to use `JDK` instead of `log4j` for logging within Dashbuilder. `CA SiteMinder TAI (SMTAI)` contains an old version of `log4j`, which causes conflicts.

|`org.apache.wink.jaxbcontextcache`
|`off`
|This property ensures that the IBM WebSphere Apache Wink framework does not cache `JAXBContexts`, which negatively impacts the performance and interferes with the custom-type serialization for the REST API.

|`kie.server.jms.queues.response`
|`jms/conn/KIE.SERVER.RESPONSE`
|The JNDI name of connection factory for responses used by the {KIE_SERVER}.

|`org.kie.server.domain`
|`WSLogin`
|JAAS `LoginContext` domain used to authenticate users when using JMS.

|`org.jbpm.server.ext.disabled`
|`true`
|Disables {CENTRAL} features, which are not supported in RHDM. If not set, {KIE_SERVER} will work, but will show error messages during start up.

|`org.jbpm.ui.server.ext.disabled`
|`true`
|Disables {CENTRAL} features, which are not supported in RHDM. If not set, {KIE_SERVER} will work, but will show error messages during start up.

|`org.jbpm.case.server.ext.disabled`
|`true`
|Disables {CENTRAL} features, which are not supported in RHDM. If not set, {KIE_SERVER} will work, but will show error messages during start up.

ifdef::BA[]
|`org.kie.server.persistence.ds`
|Set according to database type and configuration.
|Datasource JNDI name.

|`org.kie.server.persistence.tm`
|`org.hibernate.service.jta.platform.internal.WebSphereExtendedJtaPlatform`
|Transaction manager platform for setting Hibernate properties.

|`org.kie.server.persistence.dialect`
|Set according to database type and configuration.
|Specifies the Hibernate dialect to be used.
