= Mapping the {KIE_SERVER} group and role

After {KIE_SERVER} is installed, you must map the `kie-server` role to the `kie-server` group in the WebSphere Integrated Solutions Console in order to run {KIE_SERVER}.

.Prerequisite
{KIE_SERVER} is installed on the {WEBSPHERE} instance.

.Procedure
. In the WebSphere Integrated Solutions Console, navigate to *Applications* -> *Application Types* -> *WebSphere Enterprise Applications* and select the newly installed `kie-server` application.
. Under *Detail Properties*, click *Security Role to User/Group Mapping*.
. Select the `kie-server` role and click *Map Groups* to search for the `kie-server` group.
. Move the `kie-server` group from the *Available* list to the *Selected* list and click *OK*.
+
This mapping gives the previously created administrator user access to the {KIE_SERVER}.
+
. Click *Save* to complete the mapping.
. Navigate to the {KIE_SERVER} URL `http://<HOST>:<PORT>/kie-server` to verify that the server is running, or send a GET request to `http://<HOST>:<PORT>/kie-server/services/rest/server` to check whether the {KIE_SERVER} REST API works.
+
If {KIE_SERVER} is not running, consider stopping and restarting the {WEBSPHERE} instance and try again to access the {KIE_SERVER} URL or REST API.
