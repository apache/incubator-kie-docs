= Mapping the {KIE_SERVER} group and role

After {KIE_SERVER} is installed, you must map the `kie-server` role to the `kie-server` group in the WebSphere Integrated Solutions Console to run {KIE_SERVER}.
////
.Prerequisite
* {KIE_SERVER} is installed on the {WEBSPHERE} instance.
* {KIE_SERVER} nodes contain a user with `kie-server` role.
* Headless {PRODUCT} controller nodes contain a user with `kie-server` role.
////

.Procedure
. In the WebSphere Integrated Solutions Console, navigate to *Applications* -> *Application Types* -> *WebSphere Enterprise Applications* and select the newly installed `kie-server` application.
. Under *Detail Properties*, click *Security Role to User/Group Mapping*.
. Select the `kie-server` role and click *Map Groups* to search for the `kie-server` group.
. Move the `kie-server` group from the *Available* list to the *Selected* list and click *OK*.
+
This mapping gives the previously created administrator user access to {KIE_SERVER}.
+
. Click *Save* to complete the mapping.
