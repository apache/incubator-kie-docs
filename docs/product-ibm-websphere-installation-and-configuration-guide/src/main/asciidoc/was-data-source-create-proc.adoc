= Configuring JDBC data sources in {WEBSPHERE}

A data source is an object that enables a Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) client, such as an application server, to establish a connection with a database. Applications look up the data source on the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) tree or in the local application context and request a database connection to retrieve data. You must configure data sources for {WEBSPHERE} to ensure proper data exchange between the servers and the designated database.

.Prerequisite
The JDBC providers that you want to use to create database connections are configured on all servers on which you want to deploy the data source. For more information about JDBC providers, see https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSEQTP_9.0.0/com.ibm.websphere.base.doc/ae/tdat_ccrtprov.html[Configuring a JDBC provider] in the IBM Knowledge Center.

.Procedure
. In the WebSphere Integrated Solutions Console, navigate to *Resources* -> *JDBC* -> *Data sources*.
. Select the scope at which applications can use the data source. You can choose a cell, node, cluster, or server.
. Click *New* to open the *Create a data source* wizard.
. Enter a unique name in the *Data source name* field and a Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) name in the *JNDI name* field. The application server uses the JNDI name to bind resource references for an application to this data source.
+
Do not assign duplicate JNDI names across different resource types, such as data sources versus J2C connection factories or JMS connection factories.
+
Do not assign duplicate JNDI names for multiple resources of the same type in the same scope.
. Click *Next* and choose *Select an existing JDBC provider* if the provider has been created, or choose *Create new JDBC provider* to define details for a new provider. (Creating the JDBC provider before this point is recommended, as a prerequisite to adding data sources.)
. On the *Enter database specific properties for the data source* panel, click *Use this data source in container managed persistence (CMP)* if container managed persistence (CMP) enterprise beans must access this data source. Then fill in any other database-specific properties.
. Optionally, configure the security aliases for the data source. You can select none for any of the authentication methods, or choose one of the following types:
* *Component-managed authentication alias:* Specifies an authentication alias to use when the component resource reference res-auth value is `Application`. To define a new alias, navigate to *Related Items -> J2EE Connector Architecture (J2C) authentication data entries*. A component-managed alias represents a combination of ID and password that is specified in an application for data source authentication. Therefore, the alias that you set on the data source must be identical to the alias in the application code.
* *Mapping-configuration alias:* Used only in the absence of a login configuration on the component resource reference. The specification of a login configuration and the associated properties on the component resource reference is the preferred way to define the authentication strategy when the res-auth value is set to `Container`. If you specify the `DefaultPrincipalMapping` login configuration, the associated property is a JAAS - J2C authentication data entry alias.
* *Container-managed authentication alias:* Used only in the absence of a login configuration on the component resource reference. The specification of a login configuration and the associated properties on the component resource reference determines the container-managed authentication strategy when the res-auth value is set to `Container`.
. Click *Next*, review the information for the data source, and click *Finish* to save the configuration and exit the wizard.
+
The *Data sources* panel displays your new configuration in a table along with any other data sources that are configured for the same scope.
