= Create JMS connection factories

To enable messaging with {KIE_SERVER}
ifdef::BA[]
and with {CENTRAL}
endif::BA[]
, you must create certain JMS connection factories for sending and receiving messages.

.Prerequisite
You have created a service bus for {WEBSPHERE}.

.Procedure
. In the WebSphere Integrated Solutions Console, navigate to *Resources* -> *JMS* -> *Connection Factories*.
. Select the correct scope and click *New*.
. Select the *Default Messaging Provider* option and click *OK*.
. For each of the following required connection factories, enter the name of the connection factory (for example, `KIE.SERVER.REQUEST`) and the JNDI name (for example, `jms/cf/KIE.SERVER.REQUEST`), and then select the service bus from the *Bus Name* drop-down list. Leave the default values for the remaining options.
. Click *Apply* and *Save* to save the changes to the master configuration, and repeat for each required factory.
