= Mapping the headless {PRODUCT_SHORT} controller group and role

//* {KIE_SERVER} nodes contain a user with `kie-server` role. If you 
//* Headless {PRODUCT_SHORT} controller nodes contain a user with `kie-server` role.

.Procedure
. In the WebSphere Integrated Solutions Console, create the `kie-server` group and a user for that group, as described in xref:kie-server-was-goup-proc[_Creating the {KIE_SERVER} group and role_].

. Navigate to *Applications* -> *Application Types* -> *WebSphere Enterprise Applications* and select the newly installed headless {PRODUCT_SHORT} controller.
. Under *Detail Properties*, click *Security Role to User/Group Mapping*.
. Select the `kie-server` role and click *Map Groups* to search for the `kie-server` group.
