= Setting system properties in {WEBSPHERE}

Set the system properties listed in this section on your {WEBSPHERE} before you deploy {KIE_SERVER}.

.Procedure
. In the WebSphere Integrated Solutions Console, navigate to *Servers* -> *Server Types* -> *{WEBSPHERE}s*.
. In the list of application servers, choose the server on which you are going to deploy {KIE_SERVER}.
. Under the *Server Infrastructure*, click *Java and Process Management* -> *Process Definition*.

.WebSphere configuration page

+
. Under *Additional Properties*, click *Java Virtual Machine*.
+
.Process definition configuration page

+
This opens the configuration properties for the JVM that is used to start {WEBSPHERE_SHORT}.
+
. Set both the *Initial heap size* and *Maximum heap size* to `2048` and click *Apply* to increase the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) memory size. {KIE_SERVER} has been tested with these values. If you do not increase the JVM memory size, {WEBSPHERE} freezes or causes deployment errors when deploying {KIE_SERVER}.
. Under *Additional Properties*, click *Custom Properties*.
. Click *New* -> *Custom JVM Properties* and add the following properties to {WEBSPHERE_SHORT}:

.System properties for {KIE_SERVER}
|===
|Name
|Value
|Description

|`kie.server.jms.queues.response`
|`jms/KIE.SERVER.RESPONSE`
|The JNDI name of JMS queue for responses used by the {KIE_SERVER}.

|`org.kie.server.domain`
|`WSLogin`
|JAAS `LoginContext` domain used to authenticate users when using JMS.

ifdef::DM[]
|`org.jbpm.server.ext.disabled`
|`true`
|Disables {CENTRAL} features, which are not supported in RHDM. If not set, {KIE_SERVER} will work, but will show error messages during start up.

|`org.jbpm.ui.server.ext.disabled`
|`true`
|Disables {CENTRAL} features, which are not supported in RHDM. If not set, {KIE_SERVER} will work, but will show error messages during start up.

|`org.jbpm.case.server.ext.disabled`
|`true`
|Disables {CENTRAL} features, which are not supported in RHDM. If not set, {KIE_SERVER} will work, but will show error messages during start up.
endif::DM[]

ifdef::BA[]
|`org.kie.server.persistence.ds`
|`jdbc/jbpm`
|Data source JNDI name for {KIE_SERVER}.

|`org.kie.server.persistence.tm`
|`org.hibernate.service.jta.platform.internal.WebSphereExtendedJtaPlatform`
|Transaction manager platform for setting Hibernate properties.

|`org.kie.server.persistence.dialect`
|Example: `org.hibernate.dialect.H2Dialect`
|Specifies the Hibernate dialect to be used. Set according to data source.

|`org.kie.server.executor.jms.queue`
|`jms/KIE.SERVER.EXECUTOR`
|Job executor JMS queue for {KIE_SERVER}.

|`org.kie.server.router`
|Example: `http://localhost:9000`
|(Optional) Specifies one or more URLs for one or more {KIE_SERVER} routers (Smart Routers) that the application server is part of in a clustered {KIE_SERVER} environment.
endif::BA[]

|`org.jboss.logging.provider`
|`jdk`
|This property is only required where a `CA SiteMinder TAI (SMTAI)` is installed in the environment. Using this property forces Hibernate to use `JDK` instead of `log4j` for logging within Dashbuilder. `CA SiteMinder TAI (SMTAI)` contains an old version of `log4j`, which causes conflicts.

|`org.apache.wink.jaxbcontextcache`
|`off`
|This property ensures that the IBM WebSphere Apache Wink framework does not cache `JAXBContexts`, which negatively impacts the performance and interferes with the custom-type serialization for the REST API.
