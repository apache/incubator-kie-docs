= IT Orders case milestones

Milestones are configured in the process designer by adding a milestone node to the design palette.

The following milestones are configured in the IT Orders sample project:

`Hardware spec ready`::
This milestone is reached when the required hardware specification document is completed. This is configured using the following condition:
+
`org.kie.api.runtime.process.CaseData(data.get("hwSpec") != null)`
+
`Adhoc autostart` is enabled for this milestone.

`Manager decision`::
This milestone is reached when the `managerDecision` variable has been given a response. It is configured using the following condition:
+
`org.kie.api.runtime.process.CaseData(data.get("managerDecision") != null)`
+
`Adhoc autostart` is enabled for this milestone.

`Milestone 1: Order placed`::
This milestone is in a wait state until the completion condition is met. 
+
The condition for this milestone is that a case file variable named `ordered` exists with the value `true`. This is configured using the following condition:
+
`org.kie.api.runtime.process.CaseData(data.get("ordered") == true)`
+
A script task then sends a notification that the hardware order has been placed.
+
`Adhoc autostart` is enabled for this milestone.

`Milestone 2: Order shipped`::
The condition for this milestone is that a case file variable named `shipped` is `true`. This is configured using the following condition:
+
`org.kie.api.runtime.process.CaseData(data.get("shipped") == true)`
+
The `Send to tracking system` script is executed when the condition is met.
+
`Adhoc autostart` is not enabled for this milestone. Instead, it is triggered by a signal event when the order is ready to be sent.

`Milestone 3: Delivered to customer`::
The condition for this milestone is that a case file variable named `delivered` is `true`. This is configured using the following condition:
+
`org.kie.api.runtime.process.CaseData(data.get("delivered") == true)`
+
A `Customer satisfaction survey` task is created when the condition is met. 
+
`Adhoc autostart` is not enabled for this milestone. Instead, it is triggered by a signal event after the order has successfully shipped to the customer.
