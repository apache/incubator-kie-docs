= Canceling or destroying a case

Cases can be canceled if they are no longer required and do not require any case work to be performed. Cases that are canceled can be reopened later with the same case instance ID and case file data. In some cases, you might want to permanently destroy a case so that it cannot be reopened. 

Cases can only be canceled or destroyed using an API request. {PRODUCT} includes the Swagger client, which includes endpoints and documentation for REST API requests. Alternatively, you can use the same endpoints to make API calls using your preferred client or Curl.


.Prerequisites 
* A case instance has been started using Showcase. 
* You are able to authenticate API requests as a user with the `admin` role.

.Procedure
. Open the Swagger REST API client in a web browser:
+
`localhost:8080/kie-server/docs`
. Under *Case Instances :: Case Management*, open the `DELETE` request with the following endpoint:
+
`/server/containers/{id}/cases/instances/{caseId}`
+
You can cancel a case using the `DELETE` request. Optionally, you can also destroy the case using the `destroy` parameter.

. Click *Try it out* and complete the required parameters:
