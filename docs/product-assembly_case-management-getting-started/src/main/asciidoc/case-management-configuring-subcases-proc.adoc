= Configuring subcases

You can add subcases to your case definition using the process designer. A subcase is another case within your case project, similar to having a subprocess within your process. Subcases can also be added to a regular business process, which enables you to start a case from within a process instance.

The `Sub Case` asset can be found in the case definition process designer *Object Library* under *Cases*:

.Prerequisite 

* A case management process has been created and configured in {CENTRAL}.

.Procedure 
. With your case process open in the process designer, click image:3898.png[] to open the *Object Library* on the left side of the design palette. 
. Click *Cases* to open the object menu and drag the `Sub Case` data object on to the design palette and add it to the case definition.
. Click image:3897.png[] to open the *Properties* panel and click *Assignments* to open the data assignment editor. Alternatively, click image:dataio.png[] on the `Sub Case` node in the design palette. The *Sub Case Data I/O* window supports the following set of input parameters to properly configure and start the subcase:

+
Independent:: 
Optional indicator that tells the engine if the case instance is independent. If it is independent, the main case instance will not wait for its completion. This property is `false` by default.
GroupRole_XXX::
Optional group to case role mapping. The role names belonging to this case instance can be referenced here, meaning that participants of the main case can be mapped to participants of the subcase. This means that whatever group was assigned to the main case will be automatically assigned to subcase, where `XXX` is the role name and the `value` is the group role assignment.
DataAccess_XXX::
Optional data access restrictions where `XXX` is the name of data item and the `value` is the access restrictions.
DestroyOnAbort::
Optional indicator that tells the engine what to do when the subcase activity is aborted: cancel or destroy the subcase. This defaults to `true`, which destroys the subcase and removes the case file.
UserRole_XXX::
Optional user to case role mapping. You can reference the case instance role names here, meaning that an owner of the main case can be mapped to an owner of the subcase. Whoever was assigned to main case will be automatically assigned to the subcase, where `XXX` is the role name and `value` is the user role assignment.
Data_XXX::
Optional data mapping from this case instance or business process to a subcase, where `XXX` is the name of the data in subcase being targeted. This can be given as many times as needed.
DeploymentId::
Optional deployment ID (or container ID in context of {KIE_SERVER}) that indicates where the targeted case definition is located.
CaseDefinitionId::
The mandatory case definition ID to be started.

.  Regardless of the settings of the `Independent` flag, there will always be output variable available named:
+
CaseId::
This is the case instance ID of the subcases after it is started.
