// Purpose statement for the assembly
As a knowledge worker, you use {CENTRAL} in {PRODUCT} to run processes and tasks of the business process application developed by citizen developers. A business process is a series of steps which must be executed in a defined manner according to the process flow. You must have sound knowledge of the business process and should be able to determine the current step of a process or task. You can start and stop tasks, search and filter tasks, delegate, claim and release tasks, set due date and priority of tasks, view and add comments to tasks, and view the task history log.

* Installed {PRODUCT}. For more information, see the {URL_INSTALLING_DM_ON_PREMISE}[_{INSTALLING_DM_ON_PREMISE}_].
