= Upgrading a {KIE_SERVER}

You can upgrade a BRMS 6.4 KIE server to {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} {KIE_SERVER} by installing the new server on the same host. You can use existing KJAR files. However, for optimal performance,upgrade and rebuild the projects.

.Procedure
. Install {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} {KIE_SERVER} on the same host as a BRMS 6.4 KIE server. Use a separate JBoss EAP installation. For instructions, see {URL_INSTALLING_DM_ON_PREMISE}[{INSTALLING_DM_ON_PREMISE}].
. If you have configured the BRMS 6.4 KIE server to use a different port,copy the configuration to the {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} {KIE_SERVER}. 
. Configure the {KIE_SERVER} to use a Maven repository that contains your decision services. Use one ofthe following approaches:
+
** To copy the configuration of the BRMS 6.4 KIE server to use the same KJAR files, copy the value of the `kie.maven.settings.custom` property from the old version `$EAP_home/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml` file to the same file in the new version.  
+
** Upgrade your decision services to the new version. For instructions, see xref:projects-central-migrating-proc and xref:projects-java-migrating-proc. Upload the new KJAR files to a Maven repository. Then configure the {KIE_SERVER} to use the repository:
+
.. Create a `settings.xml` file for the Maven repository
.. In the `$EAP_home/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml` file for {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} {KIE_SERVER}, under the `<system-properties>` tag, set the `kie.maven.settings.custom property` to the full pathname of the `settings.xml` file, for example:
+
[source,xml]
----
<property name="kie.maven.settings.custom" value="/opt/custom-config/settings.xml"/>
----
. Stop the BRMS 6.4 KIE server.
. Start the {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} {KIE_SERVER}.
. Use the API to start the necessary decision services. For instructions, see {URL_PACKAGING_DEPLOYING_DECISION_SERVICE}[{PACKAGING_DEPLOYING_DECISION_SERVICE}].

.Result
The {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} {KIE_SERVER} operates on the same URLs and provides the same services as the BRMS 6.4 KIE server. 

Client applications normally work without changes as the incompatible changes to the REST API are minimal:

* The ServiceResponse wrapper was removed from the Planner service responses.

IMPORTANT: in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} {KIE_SERVER} a new option for configuring a {KIE_SERVER} became available. You can configure the server ti connect to a {CENTRAL}. The {CENTRAL} can manage several {KIE_SERVERS} and deploy the same or different decision services on them. For instructions, see {URL_PACKAGING_DEPLOYING_DECISION_SERVICE}[{PACKAGING_DEPLOYING_DECISION_SERVICE}].
