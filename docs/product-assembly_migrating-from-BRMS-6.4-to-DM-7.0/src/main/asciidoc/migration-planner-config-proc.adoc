= Updating {PLANNER} asset configurations in {CENTRAL}

If you have any solver configuration assets (`.solver.xml` files) or solution-related data objects in {CENTRAL}, you must make certain updates to these assets in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} to accommodate recent {PLANNER} changes.


.Prerequisite
{CENTRAL} data has been migrated from {PRODUCT_OLD} to {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}. For migration instructions,see xref:projects-central-migrating-proc[].

.Procedure
. Log in to {CENTRAL} for {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}.
. Go to *Menu* -> *Design* -> *Projects* and select the project name.
. Open any solver configuration asset (`.solver.xml` file), if present.
. In the solver configuration designer, click *Save* without making any changes. This step is required to generate the new code for solver configuration assets in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}. Do this step with any other solver configuration assets.
. Under *Data Objects* in the *Project Explorer* (left menu), open any data object (`.java` file) configured as a *Planning Solution*, if applicable.
+
To verify if this setting is selected for this data object, click the OptaPlanner icon on the right side of the data objects designer. If *Planning Solution* is not selected, then this procedure does not apply.
. Under *general properties* in the data objects designer, set the *Superclass* drop-down option to *Nothing selected*. This setting is no longer required by {PLANNER} in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}.
. On the right side of the data objects designer, click the OptaPlanner icon to reveal the *Planner Settings*. The *Planning Solution* option should be selected (if not, then this procedure does not apply).
. Select *No selected*, then re-select *Planning Solution* and specify the *Solution Score Type*. This step is required to generate the new code for planning solutions in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}.
. Click *Save* in the data objects designer and make the same changes to any other data objects configured as a *Planning Solution*.
