= Migrating projects in {CENTRAL}

If you have created projects in the Business Central workbench in BRMS 6.4, you can migrate them to {PRODUCT} 7.0 by importing the asset repository into {CENTRAL}.

. Prerequisites

. In BRMS 6.4 Business Central, look up the names of the repositories that contain your project. The default repository name is `repository1` .
. Stop BRMS 6.4 Business Central.
. Locate the `.niogit` directory. In the default installation, its location is `$EAP_home/bin/.niogit` . This location can be changed with the ??? property in the `$EAP_home/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml` file
. Install the {PRODUCT}, including {CENTRAL}, on the same host as BRMS 6.4 Business Central, using a separate JBoss EAP installation. For instructions, see {URL_INSTALLING_DM_ON_PREMISE}[{INSTALLING_DM_ON_PREMISE}].
 
.Procedure
. Log in to {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} {CENTRAL}.
. In the main menu, select *Projects*.
. Click the image:dotdotdotbutton.png[title="Menu"] icon and select *Import Project*.
. In the *Repository URL* field, type the URL:
+
----
file://<path>/.niagits/<repository>.git
----
+
For example, if the location of the `.niogit` directory is `/opt/eap7.0/.niogit` and you want to import projects in the `.repository1` repository:
+
----
file:///opt/eap7.0/bin/.niogit/repository1.git
----
. Click *Import*.
. Select the projects to import and click *Import*.
. Wait for the importing and indexing to complete.
. Repeat the process for any other repositories that you wish to import.

.Result
The projects are imported into {CENTRAL}. You can build and deploy them as normal, using the *Build & Deploy* button.
