= Migrating projects in {CENTRAL}

If you have created projects in the Business Central workbench in BRMS 6.4, you can migrate them to {PRODUCT} 7.0 by importing the asset repository into {CENTRAL}.

.Prerequisites

. In BRMS 6.4 Business Central, look up the names of the repositories that contain your project. The default repository name is `repository1` .
. Stop BRMS 6.4 Business Central.
. Locate the `.niogit` directory. In the default installation, its location is `$EAP_home/bin/.niogit` . This location can be changed with the `org.uberfire.nio.git.dir` system property in the `$EAP_home/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml` file. The system property can also be set with a `-D` option in the command that starts Business Central.
. Install the {PRODUCT}, including {CENTRAL}, on the same host as BRMS 6.4 Business Central, using a separate JBoss EAP installation. For instructions, see {URL_INSTALLING_DM_ON_PREMISE}[{INSTALLING_DM_ON_PREMISE}].
 
.Procedure
. Log in to {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} {CENTRAL}.
. In the main menu, select *Projects*.
. Click the image:dotdotdotbutton.png[title="Menu"] icon and select *Import Project*.
. In the *Repository URL* field, type the URL:
+
----
file://<path>/.niogit/<repository>.git
----
+
For example, if the location of the `.niogit` directory is `/opt/eap7.0/bin/.niogit` and you want to import projects from the `repository1` repository:
+
----
file:///opt/eap7.0/bin/.niogit/repository1.git
----
. Click *Import*.
. Select the projects to import and click *Import*.
. A `NoRemoteRepositoryException` exception might be displayed. In this case complete the following steps:
.. In a shell terminal, change to the repository subdirectory (under the `.niogit`) directory you are importing
.. List the remotes: `git remote -v`
.. Remove all listed remotes: `git remote remove <remote-name>`
+
For example:
+
[subs="verbatim,macros"]
----
$ /opt/eap7.0/bin/.niogit/repository1.git
$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/guvnorngtestuser1/guvnorng-playground (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/guvnorngtestuser1/guvnorng-playground (push)
$ git remote remove origin
----
+
Then import the projects again. (You can add the remotes in the new repository later if necessary).
. Wait for the importing and indexing to complete.
. Repeat the process for any other repositories that you wish to import.

.Result
The projects are imported into {CENTRAL}. You can build and deploy them as normal, using the *Build & Deploy* button.

IMPORTANT: If you have developed the project in Java and then imported it into the Business Central workbench, you might need to migrate the project as a Java project. For instructions, see xref:projects-java-migrating-proc[].
