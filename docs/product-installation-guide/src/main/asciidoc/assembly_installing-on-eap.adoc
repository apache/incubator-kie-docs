= Installing {PRODUCT} on EAP using the deployable ZIP files

Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.0 (JBoss EAP 7) is a certified implementation of the Java Enterprise Edition 7 (Java EE 7) Full and Web profile specifications. JBoss EAP provides preconfigured options for features such as high-availability clustering, messaging, and distributed caching. It also enables users to write, deploy, and run applications using the various APIs and services that JBoss EAP provides.

[NOTE]
====
This section describes configuring Business Central and Execution Server in the same container. In production environments, they are usually run in different containers.
====

Unlike previous versions of {PRODUCT}, the installation of version {PRODUCT_VERSION} {RELEASE} on EAP consists of multiple deployable ZIP files, each for one component of the product, to provide additional flexibility.
