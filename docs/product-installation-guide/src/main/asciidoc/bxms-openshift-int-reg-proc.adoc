= Uploading the Product Image to the OpenShift Internal Registry
If you do not have access to an external Docker registry, you can upload the product image directly to the OpenShift registry. However, you must upload the product image again if you want to use it in another OpenShift registry.

.Prerequisites
* Access to an OpenShift environment
* External access to the OpenShift internal registry
* OpenShift user with the system:image-builder and system:registry roles
+
An OpenShift system administrator can grant these roles by entering the following commands, where `<os-user>` is the user that requires these roles:
[source,bash]
----
$ oc adm policy add-role-to-user system:image-builder <os-user> 
$ oc adm policy add-role-to-user system:registry <os-user> 
----

.Procedure
. Enter the following command where `<product-image-path>` is the path to the product image TAR file in the top-level directory of the unzipped `jboss-bpmsuite-7.0.0.Beta01-openshift.zip` file:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ docker load -i <product-image-path>
----
This command uploads the product image to the local Docker registry.
+
. Enter the following command to update the Docker registry meta data with the source of your product image:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ docker tag docker-registry.engineering.redhat.com/jboss-bpmsuite-7/<product-image-name> <openshift-IP>:<openshift-port>/<project-name><image-registry-name> 
----
Replace the variables in this command as follows:
* `<product-image-name>` is the name of the product image that you uploaded to the local Docker registry (the name of the TAR file without the `.tar` extension).
* `<openshift-IP>` is the OpenShift registry IP address.
* `<openshift-port>` is the OpenShift registry port.
* `<image-registry-name>` is a name that you give the external registry that you will use for the image, for example `bpmsuite70-smartrouter-openshift:1.0.Beta01`.
+
. Enter the following command to push the image to the OpenShift registry that you created in the previous step:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ docker push <openshift-IP>:<openshift-port>/<project name>/<image-registry-name>
----
+
