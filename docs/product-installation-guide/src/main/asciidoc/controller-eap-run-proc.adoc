on {EAP}, use this procedure to run the headless {PRODUCT_SHORT} controller.

.Prerequisite
The headless 
ifdef::PAM[]
Process Automation Manager controller
endif::[]  
ifdef::DM[]

endif::[]
 is installed and configured in the base directory of the {EAP} installation (`__EAP_HOME__`).

.Procedure
. In a terminal application, navigate to `__EAP_HOME__/bin`.
. Enter the following command:
** On Linux or UNIX-based systems:
+
[source,bash]

. To verify that the controller is working on {EAP}, enter the following command where `<CONTROLLER>` and `<CONTROLLER_PWD>` is the user name and password combination that you created in <<controller-eap-users-create-proc>>. The output of this command provides information about the {KIE_SERVER} instance.
