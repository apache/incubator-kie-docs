= Installing {PRODUCT} on {EAP}
COMMENT: We need to make sure that this section sets up a real production environment, including high availability and clustering. Some information about configuration topics needed from previous chapter 3 and the appendix in the BRMS admin/cfg guide.

{EAP_LONG} ({EAP} 7.1) is a certified implementation of the Java Enterprise Edition 7 (Java EE 7) full and web profile specifications. {EAP} provides preconfigured options for features such as high-availability clustering, messaging, and distributed caching. It also enables users to write, deploy, and run applications using the various APIs and services that  {EAP} provides.

[NOTE]
====
This section describes configuring {CENTRAL} and {KIE_SERVER} in the same container. In production environments, they are usually run in different containers.

Comment: We need to tell users how to install in different containers.
