Major release migrations

A major release migration is often required when an application is moved from one major release to another, such as from {PRODUCT_OLD} 6.4 to {PRODUCT} 7.0. This type of migration is not addressed in this guide.

For instructions on how to migrate from previous releases of {PRODUCT}, see the Migration Guide.

Minor release upgrades

JBoss EAP periodically provides point releases, which are minor updates that include bug fixes, security fixes, and new features. Minor updates are not applied via patching. If you plan to upgrade from one JBoss EAP point release to another, for example, from JBoss EAP 7.0 to JBoss EAP 7.1, code changes should not be required for applications that follow the Java EE specification and do not use any private, unsupported, or tech preview modules.

For instructions on how to upgrade from one JBoss EAP 7 point release to another, see the upgrading chapter.

Patch updates

JBoss EAP also periodically provides individual or cumulative patches that contain bug and security fixes. Cumulative patches increment the minor release version by the last digit, for example from 7.0.1 to 7.0.2. These patches do not require migration and should not impact the server configuration files. The patch management system for ZIP/installer installations can also rollback the patch and server configuration.

{PRODUCT} patches can be either planned or asynchronous updates:

* _Planned patch updates_: The cumulative patches of an existing product, which includes all previously developed updates for that version of the product.

* _Asynchronous patch updates_: Individual patches which are released outside the normal update cycle of the existing product. These may include security patches, as well as other individual patches provided by Red Hat Global Support Services (GSS) to fix specific issues.

For instructions on how to patch JBoss EAP, see the patching chapter.
