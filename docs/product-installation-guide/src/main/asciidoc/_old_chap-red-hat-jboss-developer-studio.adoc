== Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio

Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio is the JBoss Integrated Development Environment (IDE) based on Eclipse. Get the latest Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio from the https://access.redhat.com[Red Hat Customer Portal]. Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio provides plug-ins with tools and interfaces for Red Hat JBoss BRMS and Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite. These plugins are based on the community version of these products. So, the Red Hat JBoss BRMS plug-in is called the Drools plug-in and the Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite plug-in is called the jBPM plug-in.

See the [ref]_Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio_ documentation for installation and setup instructions.

WARNING: Due to an issue in the way multi-byte rule names are handled, you must ensure that the instance of JBoss Developer Studio is started with the file encoding set to UTF-8. You can do this by editing the `$_JBDS_HOME_/studio/jbdevstudio.ini` file and adding the following property: `"-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8"`.
