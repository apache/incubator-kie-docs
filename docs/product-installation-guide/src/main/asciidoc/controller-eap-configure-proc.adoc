headless Process Automation Manager controller[id='controller-eap-configure-proc']
= Configuring {KIE_SERVER} and the headless Process Automation Manager controller

If {KIE_SERVER} will be managed by the headless Process Automation Manager controller, you must edit the `standalone.xml` file in both the {KIE_SERVER} and headless Process Automation Manager controller installations, as described in this section.


.Prerequisites
* {KIE_SERVER} is installed in the base directory of the {EAP} installation (`__EAP_HOME__`) as described in the following section:
. 
+
//** installer-run-proc_{context}>>
//** installer-run-cli-proc_{context}>>
** <<assembly_installing-on-eap-deployable>>
* The Controller is installed in an  `__EAP_HOME__`.
+
[NOTE]
====
Red Hat recommends that you install {KIE_SERVER} and the headless Process Automation Manager controller on different servers in production environments. However, if you install {KIE_SERVER} and the headless Process Automation Manager controller on the same server, for example in a development environment, make these changes in the shared `standalone.xml` file. 
====
* On {KIE_SERVER} nodes, a user with the `kie-server` role exists.
* On the Controller server nodes, a user with the `kie-server` role exists.

.Procedure
. In the Controller  `__EAP_HOME__/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml` file, add the following properties to the `<system-properties>` section and replace `<USERNAME>` and `<USER_PWD>` with the credentials of a user with the `kie-server` role:
+
[source,xml]
----
   <property name="org.kie.server.user" value="<USERNAME>"/>
   <property name="org.kie.server.pwd" value="<USER_PWD>"/>
----
. In the {KIE_SERVER}  `__EAP_HOME__/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml` file, add the following properties to the `<system-properties>` section:
+
[source,xml]
----
  <property name="org.kie.server.controller.user" value="<CONTROLLER_USER>"/>
  <property name="org.kie.server.controller.pwd" value="<CONTROLLER_PWD>"/>
  <property name="org.kie.server.id" value="<KIE_SERVER_ID>"/>
  <property name="org.kie.server.location" value="http://<HOST>:<PORT>/kie-server/services/rest/server"/>
  <property name="org.kie.server.controller" value="<CONTROLLER_URL>"/>
----
. In this file, replace the following values:
* Replace `<CONTROLLER_USER>` and `<CONTROLLER_PWD>` with the credentials of a user with the `kie-server` role.
* Replace `<KIE_SERVER_ID>` with the ID or name of the {KIE_SERVER} installation, for example, `rhpam700-process-server-1`.
* Replace `<HOST>` with the ID or name of the {KIE_SERVER} host, for example, `localhost` or `192.7.8.9`.
* Replace `<PORT>` with the port of the {KIE_SERVER} host, for example, `8080`.
+ 
[NOTE]
====
The `org.kie.server.location` property specifies the location of {KIE_SERVER}.
====

* Replace `<CONTROLLER_URL>` with the URL of the headless Process Automation Manager controller. {KIE_SERVER} connects to this URL during startup.
