= Installing {PRODUCT} using the installer

The installer for {PRODUCT} is an executable JAR file. You can use it to install {PRODUCT} in an existing {EAP} 7.1 installation.

[NOTE]
====
For security reasons, you should run the installer as a non-root user.
====

.Prerequisite

* A backed up {EAP} installation, version 7.1 or higher. 
* Sufficient user permissions to complete the installation.
* The JAR binary inlcuded in `$PATH` environment variable. On Red Hat Enterprise Linux, it is included in the `java-$_JAVA_VERSION_-openjdk-devel` package.

.Procedure
. In a terminal window, navigate to the directory where you downloaded the installer file and enter the following command:
+
[source]
----
java -jar rhdm-installer-7.0.0.CR1.jar COMMENT: Update file name
----
+
[NOTE]
====
When running the installer on Windows, you may be prompted to provide administrator credentials during the installation. To prevent this, add the `izpack.mode=privileged` option to the installation command:

[source]
----
java -Dizpack.mode=privileged -jar rhdm-installer-7.0.0.CR1.jar
----

Furthermore, when running the installer with a 32-bit Java Virtual Machine, you can encounter memory limitations. To solve the issue, run:

[source]
----
java -XX:MaxHeapSize=4g -jar rhdm-installer-7.0.0.CR1.jar
----
====
+
The graphical installer will execute and display a splash screen and a license agreement page.

. Click *I accept the terms of this license agreement* and click *Next*.
. Specify the {EAP} home, for example jboss-eap-7.1.0, where you want to install {PRODUCT} and click *Next*.
. Select the components that you want to install and click *Next*. 
+
* Select *{PRODUCT} deployment* to install Decision Manager. 
* Select *{PRODUCT} execution server deployment* to install {KIE_SERVER}.  COMMENT: Is this correct?
+
[NOTE]
====
It is possible install Decision Manager and {KIE_SERVER} in the same container. However, you should install them in separate containers. To do this, run the installer twice, on different containers.
====
. Create the Decision Manager admin user and click *Next*.  
+
[NOTE]
====
Make sure that the selected user name does not conflict with any known title of a role or a group. For example, if there is a role called `admin`, you should not create a user with the user name `admin`.

The password must have at least eight characters and must contain at least one number and one non-alphanumeric character (_not_ including the character `&`).
====
+
Make a note of the user name and password. You will need them to access Decision Central or {KIE_SERVER} (or both).
. On the Component Installation page, click *Next* to start the installation. The Component Installation page lists the components that you will install.

. When the installation has comleted, click *Next* on the *Processing finished* page. On the next page,you will see the message *Installation has completed successfully*.

.  If desired, click *Generate installation script and properties file* to save the installation data in an XML file, then click *Done*.

You have successfully installed {PRODUCT} using the installer. If you installed only Decision Central, repeat these steps to install {KIE_SERVER} in a separate container.
