= Clustering Maven Repositories

Various Business Central operations publish JAR files to the Business Central's internal Maven Repository.

This repository exists on the application server file-system as regular files and is not cluster aware. This folder is not synchronized across the various nodes in the cluster and must be synchronized using external tools like `rsync`.

An alternative to the use of an external synchronization tool is to set the system property `org.guvnor.m2repo.dir` on each cluster node to point to a SAN or NAS. In such case, clustering of the Maven repository folder is not needed.
