= {PRODUCT} components

{PRODUCT} is made up of {CENTRAL} and {KIE_SERVER}. {CENTRAL} is the graphical user interface where you create and manage business rules. {KIE_SERVER} is the server where the rules and other artifacts are stored. {KIE_Server} is used to instantiate and execute rules and solve planning problems.

You install {PRODUCT} in containers. The instructions in this document explain how to install {PRODUCT} in  {EAP} containers. However, you can install in other containers as well. See <<ba-dm-supported-platforms-ref>> for a list of supported containers.

[NOTE]
====
It is possible install {CENTRAL} and {KIE_SERVER} in the same container but Red Hat recommends that you install them in separate containers.
