= Importing projects from Git repositories
Git is a distributed version control system. It implements revisions as commit objects. When you commit your changes into a repository, a new commit object in the Git repository is created. When you create a project in {CENTRAL} it is added to the Git repository connected to {CENTRAL}.

If you have projects in other Git repositories, you can import them into {CENTRAL} spaces.

.Prerequisite
{PRODUCT} projects in an external Git repository

.Procedure
. In {CENTRAL}, click *Menu* -> *Design* -> *Projects*.
. Select or create the space into which you want to import the projects. The default space is *myteam*.
. Click the three verticle dots on the right side of the screen and select *Import Project*.
. In the *Import Project* window, enter the URL and credentials for the Git repository that contains the projects that you want to import and click *Import*. The projects are added to the current space.
