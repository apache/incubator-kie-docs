= Clustering Using the JAR Installer

NOTE: The JAR installer provides sample setup only. Adjusting the configuration is necessary for it to suit your project's needs.

Using the JAR installer,
ifdef::BPMS[]
described in <<_sect_the_red_hat_jboss_bpm_suite_installer_installation>>,
endif::BPMS[]
you can set up a basic clustering configuration of {PRODUCT}.

The automatic configuration creates:

* ZooKeeper ensemble with three ZooKeeper nodes
* A Helix cluster
* Two Quartz datastores (one managed, one unmanaged)

This {PRODUCT} setup consists of two {EAP} nodes that share a Maven repository, use Quartz for coordinating timed tasks, and have `business-central.war`, `dashbuilder.war`, and `kie-server.war` deployed. To customize the setup to fit your scenario, or to use clustering with the deployable ZIP, see <<_clustering_custom_configuration>> and the clustering documentation of your container.

Follow the installation process described in <<_installing_red_hat_jboss_brmsbpm_suite_using_the_installer>>.

. In *Configure runtime environment*, select *Install clustered configuration* and click *Next*.
. Select the JDBC vendor for your database.
. Provide the corresponding driver JAR(s):
+
	* Select one or more files on the filesystem.
	* Provide one or more URLs. The installer downloads the files automatically.
+
The installer copies the JAR(s) into `_EAP_HOME_/modules` and creates corresponding `module.xml` file.

endif::BPMS[]

. Enter the url, username, and password for accessing the database used by Quartz.
+
The installer creates:

* The Quartz definition file in `_EAP_HOME_/domain/configuration/quartz-definition.properties`
* Two Quartz data sources in  `_EAP_HOME_/domain/domain.xml`
+
Edit the `domain.xml` file to customize the setup.
+
[NOTE]
====
During the installation, Quartz DDL scripts will be run on the database selected in this step. The scripts make changes needed for Quartz to operate, such as adding tables. You can view the scripts in `_EAP_HOME_/jboss-brms-bpmsuite-{PRODUCT_VERSION}-supplementary-tools/ddl-scripts`. No modifications should be necessary.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When using the JAR installer, the `war` archives are automatically created from the applications in `_EAP_HOME_/standalone/deployments/`. That means additional space is necessary as the applications exist both in uncompressed and compressed state in the storage during the installation.
====
+
Three ZooKeeper instances are created in `_EAP_HOME_/jboss-brms-bpmsuite-{PRODUCT_VERSION}-supplementary-tools/` in directories `zookeeper-one`, `zookeeper-two`, and `zookeeper-three`.


After the installation finishes, do not start the server from the installer. To make Apache Helix aware of the cluster nodes, Apache ZooKeeper instances, and start the cluster:
