= Git Repository Clustering Mechanism

To cluster the Git repository, {PRODUCT} uses:

// The additional info was requested by Alessandro. Please, do not delete as superfluous.

Apache Helix::
Provides cluster management functionality that allows you to synchronize and replicate data among the nodes in your cluster. Apache Helix cluster is managed by Apache ZooKeeper. With Apache Helix, you can define a cluster, add nodes to the cluster, remove nodes from the cluster, and perform other cluster-management tasks.
+
Additional information:

* Apache Helix needs to be configured on a single node only. The configuration is then stored and distributed by ZooKeeper.
* Apache Helix cluster is administered by the `helix-admin.sh` script. See Apache Helix http://helix.apache.org/0.6.5-docs/tutorial_admin.html[documentation] for the list of commands as well as alternative ways of managing Apache Helix cluster.
* Apache Helix cluster needs exactly one controller, which must be aware of all the nodes. See Apache Helix http://helix.apache.org/0.6.5-docs/tutorial_controller.html[controller] documentation and Apache Helix http://helix.apache.org/Architecture.html[architecture] documentation.

Apache ZooKeeper::
Allows you to synchronize and replicate data from the Apache Helix cluster. An Apache ZooKeeper cluster is known as an _ensemble_ and requires a majority of the servers to be functional for the service to be available.
+
However, an ensemble is not required for any type of clustering. Only a single instance of ZooKeeper is required to allow {PRODUCT} to replicate its data; the ZooKeeper ensemble serves to provide redundancy and protect against the failure of ZooKeeper itself.
+
Additional information:

* For more information about failure recovery, see Apache ZooKeeper https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.4.8/zookeeperAdmin.html#sc_dataFileManagement[Data File Management].
* For a list of commands, see Apache ZooKeeper https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.4.8/zookeeperAdmin.html#sc_zkCommands[ZooKeeper Commands: The Four Letter Words].

A typical clustering setup involves the following:

. Configuring the cluster using Apache ZooKeeper and Apache Helix. This is required only for design-time clustering.
ifdef::PAM[]
. Configuring the back-end database with Quartz tables. This is required only for processes with timers.
endif::PAM[]
. Configuring clustering on your container. _{PRODUCT} Installation Guide_ provides only clustering instructions for {EAP} 7.1.
