= System integration with Maven 

{PRODUCT} is designed to be used with https://maven.repository.redhat.com/ga/[Red Hat JBoss Middleware Maven Repository] and Maven Central repository as dependency sources. Ensure that both the dependencies are available for projects builds.

Ensure that your project depends on specific versions of an artifact. `LATEST` or `RELEASE` are commonly used to specify and manage dependency versions in your application. 

* `LATEST` refers to the latest deployed (snapshot) version of an artifact.
* `RELEASE` refers to the last non-snapshot version release in the repository. 

By using `LATEST` or `RELEASE`, you do not have to update version numbers when a new release of a third-party library is released, however, you lose control over your build being affected by a software release.
