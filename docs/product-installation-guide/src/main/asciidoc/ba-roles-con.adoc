= Roles and users

Before starting the server and logging in to {CENTRAL}, you must create the `admin` role. This section describes the different user roles that are used in {PRODUCT}:

* `admin`: The users with `admin` role are the administrators of the application. Administrators can manage users, manage the repositories (create and clone), and have full access to make the required changes in the application. Admins have access to all areas within the system.
ifdef::BPMS[]
* `developer`: A developer has access to almost all features and can manage rules, models, process flows, forms, and dashboards. They can manage the asset repository, they can create, build and deploy projects and they can even use Red&nbsp;Hat JBoss&nbsp;Developer&nbsp;Studio to view processes. Only certain administrative functions like creating and cloning a new repository are hidden for the developer role.
