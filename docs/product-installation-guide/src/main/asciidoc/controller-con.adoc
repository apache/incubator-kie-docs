= Installing and running the headless Process Automation Manager controller

You can configure {KIE_SERVER} to run in managed or unmanaged mode. If {KIE_SERVER} is unmanaged, you must manually create and maintain containers. If {KIE_SERVER} is managed, the Process Automation Manager controller manages the {KIE_SERVER} configuration and you interact with the Controller to create and maintain containers.

The Process Automation Manager controller is integrated with {CENTRAL}. If you install {CENTRAL}, use the *Execution Server* page to create and maintain containers. However, if you do not install {CENTRAL}, you can install the headless Process Automation Manager controller and use the REST API or the {KIE_SERVER} Java Client API to interact with it.
