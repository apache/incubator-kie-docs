= Using the installer to install {PRODUCT} on {EAP} or Red Hat JBoss Web Server 

This section describes the steps required to install {PRODUCT} using the installer JAR file. The JAR file is an executable file that installs {PRODUCT} in an existing {EAP} 7.1 or Red Hat JBoss Web Server 3.1 with Tomcat 8 server installation. You can run the installer in standard or command line interface (CLI) mode.

[NOTE]
====
The {PRODUCT} JAR file installer does _not_ support the {EAP} distribution installed by yum or RPM Package Manager. If you want to install {PRODUCT} in this type of {EAP} installation, download the  {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} Deployable for {EAP} 7.1 file and follow the steps described in <<assembly_installing-on-eap-deployable>>.
====

[NOTE]
====
Because IBM JDK cannot use keystores generated on other JDKs, it is not possible to install {PRODUCT} into an existing {EAP} installation running on IBM JDK with a keystore generated on another JDK.
