= Running {PRODUCT} in standalone mode
After you have installed {PRODUCT} on {EAP}, use this procedure to run the {PRODUCT} in standalone mode.
COMMENT: Do we need to tell them how to run in non-standalone mode, or any other mode? What other modes are there?

.Prerequisites
* {PRODUCT} installed in `__EAP_HOME__` as described in <<assembly_installing-on-eap-deployable>>.
* {PRODUCT} configured as described in <<eap_execution_server_configure_proc>>.

.Procedure

. In a terminal application, navigate to `__EAP_HOME__/bin`.

** On Linux or UNIX-based systems:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ ./standalone.sh
----
** On Windows:
+
[source,bash]
----
standalone.bat

If you deployed {KIE_SERVER} without {CENTRAL} on {EAP} then you must use one of the following commands to start {EAP} with the standalone-full profile.

On Linux or UNIX-based systems:
----
$ /standalone.sh -c standalone-full.xml
----

On Windows:
[source,bash]
----
standalone.bat -c standalone-full.xml
