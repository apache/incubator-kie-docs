= Clustering {PRODUCT} for a development environment

Developers use {PRODUCT} to create rules and processes that users then run for a runtime environment to assist with decision making. The primary benefit of clustering {PRODUCT} development environments is high availability and enhanced collaboration. For example, if clustering is configured and Developer X is authoring rules on {CENTRAL} Node1 then Developer Y, who is working on {CENTRAL} Node2, can see the rules authored by Developer X as they are created. Furthermore, all of the developers working on individual nodes of the cluster will see the same synchronized content. In addition, clustering provides high availability in the rules development environment. If Developer X is working on Node1 and that node fails, Developer X's work is preserved and visible on any other node of the cluster.

Most development environments consist of {CENTRAL} for creating rules and processes and at least one {KIE_SERVER} to test those rules and processes. 

[NOTE]
====
You can also use this configuration for runtime environemtns if you want to use {CENTRAL} to manage the {KIE_SERVER}s in the cluster.
