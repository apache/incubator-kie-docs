= Installing the standalone {KIE_SERVER} Controller

You can install the standalone {KIE_SERVER} Controller and use the REST API or the {KIE_SERVER} Java Client API to interact with it.

.Prerequisites
* A backed up {EAP} installation, version 7.1 or higher. The base directory of the {EAP} installation is referred to as `__EAP_HOME__`. 
* Sufficient user permissions to complete the installation.

.Procedure
. Download the `rhdm-7.0-controller-ee7.zip` file by clicking *Download* next to *{PRODUCT} 7.0.0 Add Ons* on the Product Downloads page of the https://access.redhat.com[Red Hat Customer Portal].
. Unzip the `rhdm-7.0.0.GA-add-ons.zip` file. The `rhdm-7.0-controller-ee7.zip` file is in the unzipped directory.
. Extract the `rhdm-7.0-controller-ee7` archive to a temporary directory. steps `__TEMP_DIR__`.
. Copy the `__TEMP_DIR__/rhdm-7.0-controller-ee7/controller.war` directory to `__EAP_HOME__/standalone/deployments/`.
+
WARNING: Ensure the names of the standalone {KIE_SERVER} Controller deployments you are copying do not conflict with your existing deployments in the {EAP} instance.
. Copy the contents of the `__TEMP_DIR__/rhdm-7.0-controller-ee7/SecurityPolicy/` directory to `__EAP_HOME__/bin`. When asked to overwrite files, select *Yes*.
. In the `__EAP_HOME__/standalone/deployments/` directory, create an empty file named `controller.war.dodeploy`. This file ensures that the standalone {KIE_SERVER} Controller is automatically deployed when the server starts.
