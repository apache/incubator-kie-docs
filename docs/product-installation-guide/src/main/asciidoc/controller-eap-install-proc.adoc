= Installing the headless {PRODUCT_SHORT} controller

You can install the headless {PRODUCT_SHORT} controller and use the REST API or the {KIE_SERVER} Java Client API to interact with it.

.Prerequisites
* A backed-up {EAP} installation version 7.1 or higher is available. The base directory of the {EAP} installation is referred to as `__EAP_HOME__`.
* Sufficient user permissions to complete the installation are granted.

.Procedure
. Navigate to the https://access.redhat.com/jbossnetwork/restricted/listSoftware.html[Software Downloads] page in the Red Hat Customer Portal (login required), and select the product and version from the drop-down options:

* Product: {PRODUCT}
* Version: {PRODUCT_VERSION}
. Download *{PRODUCT} 7.0.0 Add Ons* (the `{PRODUCT_FILE}-add-ons.zip` file).
. Unzip the `{PRODUCT_FILE}-add-ons.zip` file. The `rhpam-7.0-controller-ee7.zip` file is in the unzipped directory.
. Extract the `rhpam-7.0-controller-ee7` archive to a temporary directory. In the following examples this directory is called `__TEMP_DIR__`.
. Copy the `__TEMP_DIR__/rhpam-7.0-controller-ee7/controller.war` directory to `__EAP_HOME__/standalone/deployments/`.
+
WARNING: Ensure that the names of the headless {PRODUCT_SHORT} controller deployments you are copying do not conflict with your existing deployments in the {EAP} instance.
. Copy the contents of the `__TEMP_DIR__/rhpam-7.0-controller-ee7/SecurityPolicy/` directory to `__EAP_HOME__/bin`. When asked to overwrite files, select *Yes*.
. In the `__EAP_HOME__/standalone/deployments/` directory, create an empty file named `controller.war.dodeploy`. This file ensures that the headless {PRODUCT_SHORT} controller is automatically deployed when the server starts.
