= User roles

The following user roles are available with {PRODUCT}:

* `admin`: Users with the `admin` role are the administrators of {PRODUCT}. Administrators can manage users, manage, create, and clone the repositories, and have full access to make the required changes in the application. Users with the `admin` role have access to all areas within the system.

* `analyst`: Users with the `analyst` role have access to all high-level features to model projects. However, *Authoring* -> *Administration* access is unavailable to these users. Certain lower-level features intended for developers, such as the *Deployment* -> *Artifact Repository* view are not available to this role. However, the *Build & Deploy* button is available to users with the analyst role while they are using the Project Editor.

* `kie-server`: Users with the `kie-server` role can access {KIE_SERVER} (KIE Server) REST capabilities.
* `rest-all`: Users with the `rest-all` role can access {CENTRAL} REST capabilities.

Before you can use {CENTRAL}, you must create a user that has the `admin` role. To log in to {KIE_SERVER}, you must create a user that has the `kie-server` role. You can create a single user that has both of these roles, or all available roles. The `analyst` and `rest-all` roles are optional.
