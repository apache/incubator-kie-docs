= Clustering {KIE_SERVER} for a runtime environment
In a runtime environment, {KIE_SERVER} runs rules and processes that support business decisions. The primary benefit of clustering a {KIE_SERVER} runtime environment is load balancing. If activity on one node of the cluster increases, that activity can be shared among the other nodes of the cluster to improve performance.

To create a {KIE_SERVER} clustered runtime environment, download and extract {EAP} 7.1 and {KIE_SERVER}. Then, configure {EAP} 7.1 for a domain-mode cluster, start the cluster, and install {KIE_SERVER} on each cluster node.

If desired, you can then cluster the headless
