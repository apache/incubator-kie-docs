= {PRODUCT} ZIP file installation
The {PRODUCT} ZIP file installation does not require a graphical user interface so you can install {PRODUCT} using SSH. It consists of two ZIP files, one for {CENTRAL} and one for {KIE_SERVER}.

[NOTE]
====
Red Hat recommends that you install {KIE_SERVER} and the {KIE_SERVER} Controller on different servers in production environments.

For information about installing the standalone {KIE_SERVER} Controller, see <<controller-con>>.
