When you create the user name and password, make sure that the specified user name does not conflict with any known title of a role or a group. For example, if there is a role called `admin`, you should not create a user with the user name `admin`.

The password must have at least eight characters and must contain at least one number and one non-alphanumeric character (_not_ including the character `&`).

Make a note of the user name and password. You will need them to access {CENTRAL} and {KIE_SERVER}.
