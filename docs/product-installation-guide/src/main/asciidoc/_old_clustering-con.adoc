= Clustering

You can create two types of {PRODUCT} clusters:

Design-Time Clustering::
Allows you to share assets in the Git repository, such as processes, rules, data objects, and others, with all the {PRODUCT} nodes in your cluster. It is suitable in case of concerns about a single point of failure and high availability during the development process. Design-time clustering makes use of _Apache Helix_ and _Apache ZooKeeper_.
+
Design-time clustering is not required for runtime execution.

Runtime Clustering::
Allows you to use the clustering capabilities of your container, such as {EAP}. Runtime clustering does not require you to manage any Apache Helix or Apache ZooKeeper nodes. _Quartz Enterprise Job Scheduler_ is supported if you use timers in your application.

[NOTE]
====
If you use the Websphere Application Server, Quartz setup is not necessary. Instead, use clustered EJB Timers. For more information, see the https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2175471[How to setup BPM Suite Timers to work in Websphere Application Server clustering] support article.

You can cluster the following components of {PRODUCT}:

* Design-time cluster
** _Git repository_: virtual-file-system (VFS) repository that holds the business assets.
* Runtime cluster
ifdef::BPMS[]
** _Intelligent Process Server, or web applications_: the web application nodes must share runtime data.
endif::BPMS[]
ifdef::BRMS[]
** _RealTime {KIE_SERVER}, or Web applications_: the web application nodes must share runtime data.
endif::BRMS[]
