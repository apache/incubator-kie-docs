= Creating users
Before you can use {CENTRAL}, you must create a user that has the `admin` role. To log in to {KIE_SERVER}, you must create a user that has the `kie-server` role. You can create a single user that has both of these roles.

.Prerequisites
{PRODUCT} installed in an  `__EAP_HOME__` as described in one of the following sections:

* <<installer-run-proc>>
* <<installer-run-cli-proc>>
* <<assembly_installing-on-eap-deployable>>

.Procedure
. In a terminal application, navigate to the `__EAP_HOME__/bin` directory.
. Create a user that you will use to log in to {CENTRAL} and {KIE_SERVER}. In the following command, replace `<username>` and   `<password>` with the user name and password of your choice.

[NOTE]
====
Make sure that the specified user name is not the same as an existing user, role, or group. For example, do not create a user with the user name `admin`.

The password must have at least eight characters and must contain at least one number and one non-alphanumeric character, but not & (ampersand).

. Make a note of your user name and password.
