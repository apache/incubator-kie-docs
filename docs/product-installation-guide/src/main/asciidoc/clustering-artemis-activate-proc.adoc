AMQ Broker is a full-featured, message-oriented middleware broker based on ActiveMQ Artemis.  It offers specialized queueing behaviors, message persistence, and manageability. Core messaging is provided by Apache ActiveMQ Artemis with support for different messaging styles such as publish-subscribe, point-to-point, and store-and-forward. It supports multiple protocols and client languages.  AMQ Broker supports clustering and high availability through shared store or shared nothing state replication.
