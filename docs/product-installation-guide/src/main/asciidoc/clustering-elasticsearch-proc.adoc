= Setting up Elasticsearch
Elasticsearch is a highly scalable open source full-text search and analytics engine. It enables you to store, search, and analyze high volumes of data quickly and in near real time.  In a {PRODUCT} clustered environment, it enables you to perform complex and efficient searches across nodes. Set up Elasticsearch on the main node of the cluster.
