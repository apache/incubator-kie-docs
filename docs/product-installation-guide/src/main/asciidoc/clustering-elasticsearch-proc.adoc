= Setting up Elasticsearch
//COMMENT: Will elasticseach be productized in time for PAM 7.1?
Elasticsearch is a highly scalable open source full-text search and analytics engine. It enables you to store, search, and analyze high volumes of data quickly and in near real time.  In a {PRODUCT} clustered environment, it enables you to perform complex and efficient searches across cluster nodes. Set up Elasticsearch on one node of the cluster.

.Prerequisite
A {EAP} 7.1 cluster is configured as described in  https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/reference_architectures/2017/html-single/configuring_a_red_hat_jboss_eap_7_cluster/[_Configuring a {EAP} 7 Cluster_].

.Procedure
. Download and unzip the  https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-5.6.5.zip[Elasticsearch] installation file on one node of the cluster. 
. Replace the contents of the `elasticsearch/config/elasticsearch.yml` file as follows, where `<MAIN_NODE_IP>` is the IP address of the node of the cluster where you unzipped the Elasticsearch file:
+
[source]
----
cluster.name: kie-cluster
transport.host: <MAIN_NODE_IP>
http.host: <MAIN_NODE_IP>
transport.tcp.port: 9300
xpack.security.enabled: false
discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes: 1
----
. Install the following plug-in, where `_ELASTICSEARCH_HOME_` is the directory where you unzipped the Elasticsearch file:
+
* On Linux or UNIX-based systems, enter:
+
`_ELASTICSEARCH_HOME_/bin/elasticsearch-plugin install x-pack`
+
* On Windows, enter:
+
`_ELASTICSEARCH_HOME_\bin\elasticsearch-plugin.bat install x-pack`

. Run Elasticsearch:
+
* On Linux or UNIX-based systems, enter:
+
`_ELASTICSEARCH_HOME_/bin/elasticsearch`
+
On Windows, enter:
+
`_ELASTICSEARCH_HOME_\bin\elasticsearch.bat`
