= Setting up Elasticsearch
Elasticsearch is a highly scalable open-source full-text search and analytics engine. It enables you to store, search, and analyze big volumes of data quickly and in near real time.  In a {PRODUCT} clustered environment, it enables you to perform complex and efficient searches across nodes. Set up Elasticsearch on the main node of your cluster.

.Prerequisites
* Apache ActiveMQ Artemis installed on the main node of the cluster

.Procedure
