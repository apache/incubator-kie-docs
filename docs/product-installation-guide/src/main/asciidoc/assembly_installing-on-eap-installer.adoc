= Installing {PRODUCT} on {EAP} using the installer

This section describes the steps required to install {PRODUCT} using the installer JAR file. The JAR file is an executable file that installs {PRODUCT} on an existing {EAP} 7.1 installation. You can run the installer in standard or command line interface (CLI) mode.

WARNING: Note that the provided {PRODUCT} JAR file installer does _not_ support the {EAP} distribution installed by yum or RPM Package Manager. In this case, download the  {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} Deployable for {EAP} 7.1 file and follow the steps described in downloading_the_standalone_package1 COMMENT: Link.

[NOTE]
.Installation on IBM JDK

Because IBM JDK cannot use keystores generated on other JDKs, it is not possible to install {PRODUCT} into an existing {EAP} installation running on IBM JDK with a keystore generated on another JDK.
