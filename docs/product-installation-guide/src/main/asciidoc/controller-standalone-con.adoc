= Installing the {KIE_SERVER} standalone controller

You can configure {KIE_SERVER} to run in managed or unmanaged mode. If {KIE_SERVER} is unmanaged, you must manually create and maintain containers. If {KIE_SERVER} is managed, the {KIE_SERVER} controller manages the {KIE_SERVER} configuration and you interact with the controller to create and maintain containers. 

The controller is integrated with {CENTRAL}. If you install {CENTRAL}, use the *Exection Server* page to create and maintain containers. However, if you do not install {CENTRAL}, you can install the standalone {KIE_SERVER} controller and use the REST API or the {KIE_SERVER} Java Client API to interact with it.
