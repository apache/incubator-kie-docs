By clustering two or more computers, you have the benefits of high availability, enhanced collaboration, and load balancing. High availability decreases the chance of a loss of data when a single computer fails because data on all of the computers (nodes) of the cluster is replicated on each node of the cluster. When a computer fails, another computer fills the gap by providing a copy of the data that was on the failed computer. When the failed computer comes online again, it resumes its place in the cluster. Load balancing shares the computing load across the nodes of the cluster. Doing this improves the overall performance of the cluster.

Developers use {PRODUCT} in a development environment to create rules and processes that users then run in a runtime environment to assist with decision making. The primary benefit of clustering {PRODUCT} development environments is high availability and enhanced collaboration. For example, if clustering is configured and Developer X is authoring rules on {CENTRAL} Node1 then Developer Y, who is working on {CENTRAL} Node2, can see the rules authored by Developer X as they are created. Furthermore, all of the developers working on individual nodes of the cluster will see the same synchronized content. In addition, clustering provides high availability in the rules development environment. If Developer X is working on Node1 and that node fails, Developer X's work is preserved and visible on any other node of the cluster.

The primary benefit of clustering {PRODUCT} runtime environments is load balancing. If activity on one node of the cluster increases, that activity can be shared among the other nodes of the cluster to improve performance.

====
This section is specifically intended for {CENTRAL} development environments where you want to cluster the Git repository. It is not necessary to create a clustered environment for {KIE_SERVER} production environments.

Red Hat supports clustering {PRODUCT} on {EAP} 7.1. To create a {PRODUCT} cluster, set up a {EAP} 7.1 cluster as described in  https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/reference_architectures/2017/html-single/configuring_a_red_hat_jboss_eap_7_cluster/[_Configuring a {EAP} 7 Cluster_], then following the instructions in this document.
