= Installing {KIE_SERVER} using the deployable zip file

{KIE_SERVER} provides the runtime environment for business assets and accesses the data stored in the assets repository (Knowledge Store).

.Prerequisites
* A backed up {EAP} installation, version 7.1 or higher. The base directory of the {EAP} installation is referred to as `__EAP_HOME__`. 
* Sufficient user permissions to complete the installation.
* The following file, downloaded by clicking *Download* next to *Decision Server* on the Product Downloads page of the https://access.redhat.com[Red Hat Customer Portal]:
+
`rhdm-7.0.0.GA-kie-server-ee7.zip`
+
.Procedure
. Extract the `rhdm-7.0.0.GA-kie-server-ee7.zip` archive to a temporary directory. In the following examples this directory is called `__TEMP_DIR__`.
. Copy the `__TEMP_DIR__/rhdm-7.0.0.GA-kie-server-ee7/rhdm-7.0.0.GA-kie-server-ee7/kie-server.war` directory to `__EAP_HOME__/standalone/deployments/`.
+
WARNING: Ensure the names of the {PRODUCT} deployments you are copying do not conflict with your existing deployments in the {EAP} instance.
. Copy the contents of the `__TEMP_DIR__/rhdm-7.0.0.GA-kie-server-ee7/rhdm-7.0.0.GA-kie-server-ee7/SecurityPolicy/` to `__EAP_HOME__/bin`. When asked to overwrite files, select *Yes*.
. In the `__EAP_HOME__/standalone/deployments/` directory, create an empty file named `kie-server.war.dodeploy`. This file ensures that {KIE_SERVER} is automatically deployed when the server starts.
