endif::DM[]

.Procedure
. Extract the 
ifdef::PAM[]
`{PRODUCT_FILE}-kie-server-ee7.zip`
endif::PAM[]
ifdef::DM[]
`{PRODUCT_FILE}-kie-server-ee7.zip`
endif::DM[]
 archive to a temporary directory. In the following examples this directory is called `__TEMP_DIR__`.
. Copy the
ifdef::PAM[]
`__TEMP_DIR__/{PRODUCT_FILE}-kie-server-ee7/{PRODUCT_FILE}-kie-server-ee7/kie-server.war`
endif::PAM[]
ifdef::DM[]
`__TEMP_DIR__/{PRODUCT_FILE}-kie-server-ee7/{PRODUCT_FILE}-kie-server-ee7/kie-server.war`
endif::DM[]
 directory to `__EAP_HOME__/standalone/deployments/`.

WARNING: Ensure the names of the {PRODUCT} deployments you are copying do not conflict with your existing deployments in the {EAP} instance.
. Copy the contents of the
ifdef::PAM[]
`__TEMP_DIR__/{PRODUCT_FILE}-kie-server-ee7/{PRODUCT_FILE}-kie-server-ee7/SecurityPolicy/`
endif::PAM[]
ifdef::DM[]
`__TEMP_DIR__/{PRODUCT_FILE}-kie-server-ee7/{PRODUCT_FILE}-kie-server-ee7/SecurityPolicy/`
endif::DM[]
 to `__EAP_HOME__/bin`. When asked to overwrite files, click *Replace*.
. In the `__EAP_HOME__/standalone/deployments/` directory, create an empty file named `kie-server.war.dodeploy`. This file ensures that {KIE_SERVER} is automatically deployed when the server starts.
