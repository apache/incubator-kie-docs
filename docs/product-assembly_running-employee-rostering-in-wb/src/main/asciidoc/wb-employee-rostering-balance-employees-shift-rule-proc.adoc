= Create a guided rule to balance employee shift numbers

The `BalanceEmployeesShiftNumber` guided rule creates a soft constraint that ensures shifts are assigned to employees in a way that is balanced as evenly as possible. It does this by creating a score penalty that increases when shift distribution is less even. The score formula, implemented by the rule, incentivizes the Solver to distribute shifts in a more balanced way.

.Procedure
. Go to *Menu* -> *Design* -> *Projects* and click the project name.
. Click *Add Asset* -> *Guided Rule*.
. Enter `BalanceEmployeesShiftNumber` as the *Guided Rule* name and select the `employeerostering.employeerostering` *Package*. 
. Click *Ok* to create the rule asset.
. Add a *WHEN* condition by clicking the image:5686.png[] in the *WHEN* field.
. Select `Employee` in the *Add a condition to the rule* window. Click *+Ok*. 
. Click on the `Employee` condition to modify the constraints and add the variable name `$employee`.
. Add the *WHEN* condition `From Accumulate`. 
.. Above the `From Accumulate` condition, click *click to add pattern* and select `Number` as the fact type from the drop-down list.
.. Add the variable name `$shiftCount` to the `Number` condition.
.. Below the `From Accumulate` condition, click *click to add pattern* and select the `ShiftAssignment` fact type from the drop-down list.
.. Add the variable name `$shiftAssignment` to the `ShiftAssignment` fact type.
.. Click on the `ShiftAssignment` condition again and from the *Add a restriction on a field* drop-down list, select `employee`.
.. Select `equal to` from the drop-down list next to the `employee` constraint.
.. Click the image:6191.png[edit] icon next to the drop-down button to add a variable, and click *Bound variable* in the *Field value* window.
.. Select `$employee` from the drop-down list.
.. In the *Function* box type `count($shiftAssignment)`.
. Add the *THEN* condition by clicking the image:5686.png[] in the *THEN* field.
. Select `Modify Soft Score` in the *Add a new action* window. Click *+Ok*.
.. Type the following expression into the box: `-($shiftCount.intValue()*$shiftCount.intValue())`
. Click *Validate* in the upper-right corner to check all rule conditions are valid. If the rule validation fails, address any problems described in the error message, review all components in the rule, and try again to validate the rule until the rule passes.
. Click *Save* to save the rule.
