// Purpose statement for the assembly
As a system administrator or business rules developer, you can migrate your existing project data and server environment in {PRODUCT_OLD} 6.4 to {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}. Red Hat provides migration tools wherever possible to facilitate migration, but in some cases, manual migration or asset re-creation is required.

.Prerequisites
* {PRODUCT_OLD} 6.4 is installed and contains artifacts that you want to migrate to {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}.
* {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} is installed on a separate instance from {PRODUCT_OLD} 6.4 (on {EAP} or other instance). For installation options, see {URL_PLANNING_INSTALL}[_{PLANNING_INSTALL}_].
