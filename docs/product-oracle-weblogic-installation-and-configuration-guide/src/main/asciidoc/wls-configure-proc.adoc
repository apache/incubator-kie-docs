= Configuring {WEBLOGIC}

Before you deploy {KIE_SERVER} with {WEBLOGIC}, you must configure environment variables, security settings, JMS requirements, and other properties on {WEBLOGIC}. These configurations promote an optimal integration with {KIE_SERVER}.

.Prerequisites
* {WEBLOGIC} is installed and running.
* You are logged in to the WebLogic Administration Console.









=== Create JMS connection factories

To send and receive messages from {KIE_SERVER}, you must create a JMS connection factory for receiving messages and another JMS connection factory for sending messages.
ifdef::BA[]
You will also need to create several other connection factories for {CENTRAL}.
endif::BA[]
The following connection factories are required:

ifdef::BA[]
* `KIE.RESPONSE.ALL`: receiving all responses produced by {PRODUCT}.
+
Default value: `jms/cf/KIE.RESPONSE.ALL`.
endif::BA[]

ifdef::BA[]
* `KIE.SESSION`: sending messages to the process engine.
+
Default value: `jms/cf/KIE.SESSION`.
endif::BA[]

ifdef::BA[]
* `KIE.TASK`: sending messages to the task service.
+
Default value: `jms/cf/KIE.TASK`.
endif::BA[]

ifdef::BA[]
* `KIE.AUDIT`: sending messages with audit trail.
+
Default value: `jms/cf/KIE.AUDIT`.
endif::BA[]

ifdef::BA[]
* `KIE.SIGNAL`: sending messages with external scoped signals.
+
Default value: `jms/cf/KIE.SIGNAL`.
endif::BA[]

* `KIE.SERVER.REQUEST`: for all requests to {KIE_SERVER}.
+
Default value: `jms/cf/KIE.SERVER.REQUEST`.

* `KIE.SERVER.RESPONSE`: for receiving all responses produced by {KIE_SERVER}.
+
Default value: `jms/cf/KIE.SERVER.RESPONSE`.

Perform the following steps for each connection factory.

.Procedure
. Navigate to *Services* -> *Messaging* -> *JMS Modules* to see a list of JMS modules.
. Select your previously created module, then click *New* to create a new JMS resource.
. Select *Connection Factory* and click *Next*.
. Enter the name of the connection factory (for example
ifdef::BA[]
`KIE.RESPONSE.ALL`)
endif::BA[]
ifdef::DM[]
`KIE.SERVER.REQUEST`)
endif::DM[]
and the JNDI name (for example
ifdef::BA[]
`jms/cf/KIE.RESPONSE.ALL`)
endif::BA[]
ifdef::DM[]
`jms/cf/KIE.SERVER.REQUEST`)
endif::DM[]
and click *Next*. The connection factory automatically selects the servers assigned to the JMS Module as the default.
. Click *Finish* to complete the connection factory creation.

=== Create JMS queues

JMS queues are the destination end points for point-to-point messaging. You must create the following JMS queues:

ifdef::BA[]
* `KIE.RESPONSE.ALL`: for Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite responses.
+
Default value: `jms/KIE.RESPONSE.ALL`.
endif::BA[]

ifdef::BA[]
* `KIE.SESSION`: for process-based operations.
+
Default value: `jms/KIE.SESSION`.
endif::BA[]

ifdef::BA[]
* `KIE.TASK`: for task-based operations.
+
Default value: `jms/KIE.TASK`.
endif::BA[]

ifdef::BA[]
* `KIE.AUDIT`: for asynchronous audit logs.
+
Default value: `jms/KIE.AUDIT`.
endif::BA[]

ifdef::BA[]
* `KIE.SIGNAL`: for external scoped signals.
+
Default value: `jms/KIE.SIGNAL`.
endif::BA[]

* `KIE.SERVER.REQUEST`: for all requests to the {KIE_SERVER}.
+
Default value: `jms/KIE.SERVER.REQUEST`.
* `KIE.SERVER.RESPONSE`: for the {KIE_SERVER} responses.
+
Default value: `jms/KIE.SERVER.RESPONSE`.

Repeat the following steps to create each queue:

. Navigate to *Services* -> *Messaging* -> *JMS Modules* to see the list of JMS modules.
. Select your previously created module, then click *New* to create a new JMS resource.
. Select *Queue* and click *Next*.
. Enter the name of the queue (for example
ifdef::BA[]
`KIE.RESPONSE.ALL`)
endif::BA[]
ifdef::DM[]
`KIE.SERVER.REQUEST`)
endif::DM[]
and the JNDI name (for example
ifdef::BA[]
`jms/KIE.RESPONSE.ALL`)
endif::BA[]
ifdef::DM[]
`jms/KIE.SERVER.REQUEST`)
endif::DM[]
and then click *Next*.

. Choose the JMS module subdeployment that connects to the JMS server.
. Click *Finish* to complete the queue creation.

== Configuring unified execution servers

To configure {CENTRAL} to manage the {KIE_SERVER} and use the same data source, follow the instructions in the {URL_ADMIN_GUIDE}#unified_execution_servers[Unified Execution Servers] section of the _{ADMIN_GUIDE}_.
