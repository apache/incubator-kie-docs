= Setting system properties for the headless {PRODUCT_SHORT} controller

After you install the headless {PRODUCT_SHORT} controller, set the system properties listed in this section on your application server or servers to enable proper interaction with the headless {PRODUCT_SHORT} controller.

[NOTE]
====
For optimal results, install {KIE_SERVER} and the headless {PRODUCT_SHORT} controller on different servers in production environments. In development environments, you can install {KIE_SERVER} and the headless {PRODUCT_SHORT} controller on the same server. In either case, be sure to make these property changes on all application servers where the controller is installed.
