= Installing the Controller

This section describes how to install the Controller on Oracle Weblogic Server.

You can install the Controller and use the REST API or the {KIE_SERVER} Java Client API to interact with it.

.Prerequisites
* An Oracle Weblogic Server instance configured as described in this document
* Sufficient user permissions to complete the installation.
* The `rhdm-7.0-controller-ee7.zip` file, extracted to a temporary directory. To download this file:
+
--
.. Click *Download* next to *{PRODUCT} 7.0.0 Add Ons* on the Product Downloads page of the https://access.redhat.com[Red Hat Customer Portal].
.. Unzip the `rhdm-7.0.0.GA-add-ons.zip` file. The `rhdm-7.0-controller-ee7.zip` file is in the unzipped directory.
--

.Procedure
. Create a user and password for the Controller in the `kie-server` group, for example `controller/pwd1234`. For information about creating users, see <<wls-security-set-proc>>.
. Navigate to *Deployments* to view all existing applications.
. Click *Install*.
. Navigate to the extracted archive location for `controller.war` and select it. Click *Next* to continue.
. Select *Install this deployment as an application* as the targeting style and click *Next*.
. Keep the application name as `controller` and set the security model to `DD Only`. Leave the remaining options as default and click *Next* to continue.
. In the *Additional Configuration* section, choose *No, I will review the configuration later* and click *Finish*.

. To verify that the Controller is working on {WEBLOGIC}, enter the following command:
+
[source]
----
curl -X GET "http://<HOST>:<PORT>/controller/rest/controller/management/servers" -H  "accept: application/xml" -u '<CONTROLLER>:<CONTROLLER_PWD>'
----
+
In this command, replace `<USER_NAME>` and `<PASSWORD>` with the user credentials that you created in step 1.
+
The output of this command provides information about the {KIE_SERVER} instance.

. In a web browser, enter a URL similar to `http://localhost:7001/kie-wb/rest/controller`.
[Note]
====
Alternatively, you can use the {KIE_SERVER} Java API Client to access the Controller.
