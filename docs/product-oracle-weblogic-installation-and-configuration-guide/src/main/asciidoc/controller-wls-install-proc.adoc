= Installing and running the {KIE_SERVER} Controller with {WEBLOGIC}

To use the {KIE_SERVER} REST API or Java Client API to interact with {KIE_SERVER}, you can install the {KIE_SERVER} Controller with {WEBLOGIC}. The {KIE_SERVER} Controller manages {KIE_SERVER} configuration in a centralized way so that you can use the Controller to create and maintain containers and perform other server-level tasks.

.Prerequisites
* An {WEBLOGIC} instance is configured as described in xref:wls-configure-proc[].
* You have sufficient user permissions to complete the installation.

.Procedure
. Navigate to the https://access.redhat.com/jbossnetwork/restricted/listSoftware.html[Software Downloads] page in the Red Hat Customer Portal (login required), and select the product and version from the drop-down options:
* *Product:* {PRODUCT_SHORT}
* *Version:* {PRODUCT_VERSION}
. Download *{PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION_LONG} Add-Ons*.
. Extract the downloaded `{PRODUCT_FILE}-add-ons.zip` folder to a temporary directory.
. In the WebLogic Administration Console, navigate to *Security Realms* -> *Users and Groups*.
. In the *kie-server* group that you created previously, create a user for the Controller, such as `controller`, and a password for this new user and click *OK*. For more information about creating groups and users, see xref:wls-users-set-proc[].
. Navigate to *Deployments* to view all existing applications.
. Click *Install*.
. Navigate to the temporary directory where you downloaded and extracted the `{PRODUCT_FILE}-add-ons.zip` folder, and go to `{PRODUCT_FILE}-add-ons/{PRODUCT_INIT}-{PRODUCT_VERSION}-controller-ee7.zip/controller.war`.
. Select the `controller.war` file and click *Next* to continue.
. Select *Install this deployment as an application* as the targeting style and click *Next*.
. Keep the application name as `controller` and set the security model to `DD Only`. Leave the remaining options as default and click *Next* to continue.
. In the *Additional Configuration* section, choose *No, I will review the configuration later* and click *Finish*.
. In your command terminal, enter the following command to verify that the Controller is working on {WEBLOGIC}:

----
curl -X GET "http://<HOST>:<PORT>/controller/rest/controller/management/servers" -H  "accept: application/xml" -u '<CONTROLLER>:<CONTROLLER_PWD>'
----

`<HOST>` is the ID or name of the {KIE_SERVER} host, for example, `localhost` or `192.7.8.9`.

`<PORT>` is the port of the {KIE_SERVER} host, for example, `7001`.

`<CONTROLLER>` and `<CONTROLLER_PWD>` are the user credentials that you created in this section.

The command should return information about the {KIE_SERVER} instance.

[NOTE]
====
Alternatively, you can use the {KIE_SERVER} Java API Client to access the Controller.

If {KIE_SERVER} is not running, stop and restart the {WEBSPHERE} instance and try again to access the {KIE_SERVER} URL or API.
