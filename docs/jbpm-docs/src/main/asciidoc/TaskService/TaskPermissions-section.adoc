= Task Permissions
:imagesdir: ..


Only users associated with a specific task are allowed to modify or retrieve information about the task.
This allows users to create a jBPM workflow with multiple tasks and yet still be assured of both the confidentiality and integrity of the task status and information associated with a task. 

Some task operations will end up throwing a `org.jbpm.services.task.exception.PermissionDeniedException` when used with information about an unauthorized user.
For example, when a user is trying to directly modify the task (for example, by trying to claim or complete the task), the `PermissionDeniedException` will be thrown if that user does not have the correct role for that operation.
Furthermore, a user will not be able to view or retrieve tasks that the user is not involved with, especially if this is via the jBPM Console or KIE Workbench applications. 

User 'Administrator' and group 'Administrators' are automatically added to each  Human Task.

== Task Permissions Matrix


The permisions matrix below summarizes the actions that specific user roles are allowed to do.
On the left side, possible operations are listed while user roles are listed across the top of the matrix. 

The cells of the permissions matrix contain one of three possible characters, each of which indicate the user role permissions for that operation: 

* a "``+`` indicates that the user role CAN do the specified operation
* a "`-`" indicates that the user role MAY NOT do the specified operation
* a "`0`" indicates that the user role MAY NOT do the specified operation, and that it is also not an operation that matches the user's role ("not applicable")

Furthermore, the following words or abbreviations in the table header refer to the following roles: 

.Task roles in the permissions table
[cols="1,1,1", frame="all", options="header"]
|===
| Word
| Role
| Description

| Initiator
| Task Initiator
| The user who creates the task instance

| Stakeholder
| Task Stakeholder
| The user involved in the task: this user can influence the progress of a task, by performing administrative actions on the task instance

| Potential
| Potential Owner
| The user who can claim the task before it has been claimed, or after it has been released or forward: only tasks that have the status "Ready" may be claimed; a potential owner becomes the actual owner of a task by claiming the task

| Actual
| Actual Owner
| The user who has claimed the task and will progress the task to completion or failure

| Administrator
| Business Adminstrator
| A "super user" who may modify the status or progress of a task at any point in a task's lifecycle
|===

User roles are assigned to users by the definition of the task in the jBPM (BPMN2) process definition.

.Permissions Matrices
The following matrix describes the authorizations for all operations which modify a task:

The matrix below describes the authorizations used when retrieving task information.
In short, it says that all users which have any role with regards to the specific task, are allowed to see the task.
This applies to all operations that are used to retrieve any type of information about the task.
