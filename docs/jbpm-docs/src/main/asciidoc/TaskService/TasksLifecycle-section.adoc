= Task Lifecycle
:imagesdir: ..


From the perspective of a process, when a user task node is encountered during the execution, a human task is created.
The process will then only leave the user task node when the associated human task has been completed or aborted. 

The human task itself usually has a complete life cycle itself as well.
For details beyond what is described below,  please check out the WS-HumanTask specification.
The following diagram is from the WS-HumanTask specification and  describes the human task life cycle.

A newly created task starts in the "Created" stage.
Usually, it will then automatically become "Ready",  after which the task will show up on the task list of all the actors that are allowed to execute the task.
The task will stay "Ready" until one of these actors claims the task, indicating that he or she will be executing it. 

When a user then eventually claims the task, the status will change to "Reserved". Note that a task that only has one potential  (specific) actor will automatically be assigned to that actor upon creation of the task.
When the user who has claimed the  task starts executing it, the task status will change from "Reserved" to "InProgress". 

Lastly, once the user has performed and completed the task, the task status will change to "Completed". In this step,  the user can optionally specify the result data related to the task.
If the task could not be completed, the user could  also indicate this by using a fault response, possibly including fault data, in which case the status would change to "Failed". 

While the life cycle explained above is the normal life cycle, the specification also describes a number of other  life cycle methods, including: 

* Delegating or forwarding a task, so that the task is assigned to another actor 
* Revoking a task, so that it is no longer claimed by one specific actor but is (re)available to all actors allowed to take it 
* Temporarly suspending and resuming a task 
* Stopping a task in progress 
* Skipping a task (if the task has been marked as skippable), in which case the task will not be executed
