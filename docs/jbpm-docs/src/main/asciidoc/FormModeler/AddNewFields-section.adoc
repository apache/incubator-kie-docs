You can add fields to forms either by its origin or by selecting one type of form field. 

Let's see what has been created automatically for this purchase order form.

.Form properties have been added by default, but are not still configured

* Add fields by origin: this tab allows you to add fields to the form based on the data origins defined. These fields will have the correct configuration on the "Input binding expression" and "Output binding expression" properties, so when the form is submitted, the fields values will be stored in the corresponding Data Origin.

* Add fields by type: this tab allows you to freely add fields to the form from the Field Types palette on the Form Modeler. These fields won't be storing their values on any Data Origin until they have a correct configuration on the "Input binding expression" and "Output binding expression" properties.

To see a complete list of the available field types go to <<_sect_formmodeler_fieldtypes,Field types section>>. 

Notice the data model 'po' of type 'org.jbpm.examples.purchases.PurchaseOrder' is composed of three properties. 

* Simple: property of type text (description). We will adjust the view settings.
* Complex: property of type object (header).
* Complex: property of type array of objects (lines)

Now all these properties had to be configured.
