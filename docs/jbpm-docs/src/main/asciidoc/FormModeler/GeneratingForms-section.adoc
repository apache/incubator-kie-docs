Forms are related to tasks by following a naming convention.
If a form with a name formName-taskform is defined in the same package as the process, then this form is used by the human task engine to display and capture information from user. 

Also, if a form named ProcessId-task form is created, it will be used as the initial form when starting this process. 

For example, for our process the following forms would be generated.
