= Configure process and human tasks

To hold values capture by forms, process variables can be created.
These variables can be of a simple type like 'String' or a complex type.
These complex types can be defined by using the Data Modeler tool, or be just regular POJOs (Plain Java Objects) created with any Java IDE. 

In this example, we define a variable 'po' of type 'org.jbpm.examples.purchases.PurchaseOrder', defined with the Data Modeler tool.

This variable is declared in the 'variables definition' property for the process. 

After that, we must configure which variables are set as input parameters to the task, which ones will receive the response back from the form and establish the mappings.
This is done by setting the 'DataInputSet', 'DataOutputSet' and 'Assignments' properties for any human task.
See screenshots below for details.
