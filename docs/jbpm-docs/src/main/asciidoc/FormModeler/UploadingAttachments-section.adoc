On this section we are going to describe step by step how to attach documents to your process variables from your forms and how you can configure to store the uploaded documents anywhere (File System, Data Base, Alfresco...) using the __Pluggable Variable Persistence__. 

== Process and forms configuration


To make your process manage documents you have to define your process variables as usual using the Custom Type ``org.jbpm.document.Document``.
Each variable defined as _Document_ will be shown on the form as a FILE input.

When the process forms are genereated and a `org.jbpm.document.Document` variable si found a File input will be placed on the form.

Each time a document is uploaded using a form the Form Engine will generate an instance of `org.jbpm.document.Document` to be stored on the process variable. 

== Marshalling strategy and deployment configuration


In order to store the document using the _Pluggable Variable Persistence_ you'll have to define your _Marshalling Strategy_ to manage the uploaded Documents.
To start create a Maven project with your favourite IDE and add the following dependencies: 

[source,xml]
----

<dependency>
  <groupId>org.kie</groupId>
  <artifactId>kie-api</artifactId>
  <version>{version}</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.jbpm</groupId>
  <artifactId>jbpm-document</artifactId>
  <version>{version}</version>
</dependency>
----


Once you did that is time to create your __Document Marshalling Strategy__, to do so you just have to create a class that extends: 

[source,java]
----

package org.jbpm.document.marshalling;

public abstract class AbstractDocumentMarshallingStrategy implements ObjectMarshallingStrategy {

  public abstract Document buildDocument( String name, long size, Date lastModified, Map<String, String> params );

  public void write( ObjectOutputStream os, Object object )
        throws IOException;

  public Object read( ObjectInputStream os )
        throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException;

  public byte[] marshal( Context context, ObjectOutputStream os, Object object )
        throws IOException;

  public Object unmarshal( Context context, ObjectInputStream is, byte[] object,
        ClassLoader classloader ) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException;

  public Context createContext();
}
----


The methods to implement are: 

* **`Document buildDocument( String name, long size, Date lastModified, Map<String, String> params )`**: Creates a valid Document instance 
  with the data received. This method is called when a document is uploaded to create the Document instance `before` marshalling the document content.
* **`byte[] marshal( Context context, ObjectOutputStream os, Object object )`**: Marshals the given object and returns the marshalled object as `byte[]`
* **`Object unmarshal( Context context, ObjectInputStream is, byte[] object, ClassLoader classloader )`**: Reads the object received as `byte[]` 
  and returns the unmarshalled object
* **`void write(ObjectOutputStream os, Object object)`**: Implement for backguards compatibility, it should do the same functionallity than 
  **`byte[] marshal( Context context, ObjectOutputStream os, Object object )`**
* **`Object read(ObjectInputStream os)`**: Implement for backguards compatibility, it should do the same functionallity than 
  **`Object unmarshal( Context context, ObjectInputStream is, byte[] object, ClassLoader classloader )`**

You can see how the default _DocumentMarshallingStrategy_ is implemented looking at https://github.com/kiegroup/jbpm/blob/master/jbpm-document/src/main/java/org/jbpm/document/marshalling/DocumentMarshallingStrategy.java[this link].

After creating your _Document Marshalling Strategy_ and add it to your server classpath the only thing remaining is to configure your project deployment descriptor add it to the marshalling strategies list.
To do it you just have to open the Kie-Workbench on your browser, open your project on the Authoring view and edit the _kie-deployment-descriptor.xml_ file located on `<yourproject>/src/main/resources/META-INF` and add your _Document Marshalling Strategy_ to the `<marshalling-strategies>` list like this: 

[source,xml]
----

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<deployment-descriptor
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.jboss.org/jbpm deployment-descriptor.xsd"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
  <persistence-unit>org.jbpm.domain</persistence-unit>
  <audit-persistence-unit>org.jbpm.domain</audit-persistence-unit>
  <audit-mode>JPA</audit-mode>
  <persistence-mode>JPA</persistence-mode>
  <runtime-strategy>SINGLETON</runtime-strategy>
  <marshalling-strategies>
    <marshalling-strategy>
      <resolver>reflection</resolver>
      <identifier>
        org.jbpm.document.marshalling.DocumentMarshallingStrategy
      </identifier>
    </marshalling-strategy>
  </marshalling-strategies>
  <event-listeners/>
  <task-event-listeners/>
  <globals/>
  <work-item-handlers/>
  <environment-entries/>
  <configurations/>
  <required-roles/>
</deployment-descriptor>

Since this is done you're able to build your project and upload your documents on your process.

[NOTE]
====
On this example we are configuring the default ``DocumentMarshallingStrategy``, please use it  for test and demo purposes.
