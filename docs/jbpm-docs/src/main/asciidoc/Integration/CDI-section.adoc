= CDI

== Overview

jBPM 6 comes with out of the box integration with CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection). Although most of the API can be used in CDI world there are some dedicated modules that are designed especially for CDI containers.
The most important one is jbpm-services-cdi that provides cdi wrappers on top of jbpm services, these shall be used in most of the cases were CDI is available for jBPM integration.
It provides following set of services:

* DeploymentService
* ProcessService
* UserTaskService
* RuntimeDataService
* DefinitionService

These services are first class citizens for CDI world so they are available for injection in any other CDI bean.

=== DeploymentService

Service responsible for deploying DeploymentUnits into runtime environment.
By deploying given deployment unit becomes ready for execution and has RuntimeManager created for it.DeploymentService can next be used to retrieve:

* RuntimeManager instance for given deployment id
* DeployedUnit that represents complete deployment process for given deployment id
* list of all deployed units known to the deployment service

Deployment service stores the deployed units by default in memory and thus in case of a need to restore all previously deployed units, component that uses deployment service needs to store that information itself.
Common places for such a store are database, file system, repository of some sort, etc.
Deployment service will fire CDI events on deployment and undeployment to allow application components to react real time to these events to be able to store deployments or remove them from the store when they are undeployed.

* DeploymentEvent with qualifier @Deploy will be fired on deployment
* DeploymentEvent with qualifier @Undeploy will be fired on undeployment

use CDI observer mechanism to get notification on above events.
First to save deployments in the store of your choice:

[source,java]
----
    public void saveDeployment(@Observes @Deploy DeploymentEvent event) {
        // store deployed unit info for further needs 
        DeployedUnit deployedUnit = event.getDeployedUnit();
    }
----

next to remove it when it was undeployed

[source,java]
----
    public void removeDeployment(@Observes @Undeploy DeploymentEvent event) {
        // remove deployment with id event.getDeploymentId()
    }
----

[NOTE]
====
Deployment service comes with deployment synchronization mechanism that allows to persist deployed units into data base (since version 6.2) that is by default enabled.
See jbpm services section for more details.
====

Due to the fact that there might be several implementation of DeploymentService use of qualifiers is needed to instruct CDI container which one shall be injected.
jBPM comes with two out of the box:

* @Kjar - KmoduleDeploymentService that is tailored to work with KmoduleDeploymentUnits that are small descriptor on top of a kjar - recommended to use in most of the cases
* @Vfs - VFSDeploymentDService that allows to deploy assets directly from VFS (Virtual File System) that is provided by http://droolsjbpm.github.io/uberfire/[UberFire
  framework].
  Due to that fact VFSDeploymentService and VFSDeploymentUnit are not bundled with jbpm core modules but with jbpm-console-ng modules.

The general practice is that every implementation of DeploymentService should come with dedicated implementation of DeploymentUnit as these two provided out of the box.

=== FormProviderService

FormProviderService provides access to form representations usually displayed on UI for both process forms and user task forms.
It is built on concept of isolated FormProviders that can provide different capabilities and be backed by different technologies.
FormProvider interface describes contract for the implementations 

[source,java]
----
public interface FormProvider {

    int getPriority();

    String render(String name, ProcessDesc process, Map<String, Object> renderContext);

    String render(String name, Task task, ProcessDesc process, Map<String, Object> renderContext);
}
----

Implementations of FormProvider interface should always define priority as this is the main driver for the FormProviderService to ask for the content of the form of a given provider.
FormProviderService will collect all available providers and iterate over them asking for the form content (rendered) in their priority order.
The lower the number the higher priority it gets during evaluation, e.g.
provider with priority 5 will be evaluated before provider with priority 10.
FormProviderService will iterate over available providers as long as one delivers the content.
In the worse case scenario, simple text based forms will be returned.

jBPM comes with following FormProviders out of the box:

* Fremarker based implementation to support jbpm version 5 process and task forms - priority 3
* Default forms provider, considered last resort if none of the other providers deliver content this one will always provide simplest possible forms - lowest priority (1000)
* when form modeler is used there is additional FormProvider available to deliver forms modeled in that tool - priority 2

=== RuntimeDataService

RuntimeDataService provides access to actual data that is availabe on runtime such as

* available processes to be executed - with various filters
* active process instances - with various filters
* process instance history 
* process instance variables
* active and completed nodes of process instance

Default implementation of RuntimeDataService is observing deployment events and index all deployed processes to expose them to the calling components.
So whatever gets deployed RuntimeDataService will be aware of that.

=== DefinitionService

Service that provides access to process details stored as part of BPMN2 XML. 

[NOTE]
====
Before using any method that provides information, *buildProcessDefinition* must be invoked to populate repository with process information taken from BPMN2 content.
====

BPMN2DataService provides access to following data:

* overall description of process for given process definition
* collection of all user tasks found in the process definition
* information about defined inputs for user task node
* information about defined outputs for user task node
* ids of reusable processes (call activity) defined within given process definition
* information about process variables defined within given process definition 
* information about all organizational entities (users and groups) included in the process definition.
  Depending on the actual process definition the returned values for users and groups can contain

** actual user or group name
** process variable that will be used to get actual user or group name on runtime e.g.
  #{manager}


=== Configuring CDI integration

To make use of jbpm-services-cdi in your system you'll need to provide some beans for the out of the box services to satisfy all dependencies they have.
There are several beans that depends on actual scenario

* entity manager and entity manager factory
* user group callback for human tasks
* identity provider to pass authenticated user information to the services

When running in JEE environment like an JBoss Application Server following producer bean should satisfy all requirements of the jbpm-services-cdi

[source,java]
----
public class EnvironmentProducer { 
   
    @PersistenceUnit(unitName = "org.jbpm.domain")
    private EntityManagerFactory emf;

    @Inject
    @Selectable
    private UserGroupInfoProducer userGroupInfoProducer;

    @Inject
    @Kjar
    private DeploymentService deploymentService;

    @Produces
    public EntityManagerFactory getEntityManagerFactory() {
        return this.emf;
    }

    @Produces
    public org.kie.api.task.UserGroupCallback produceSelectedUserGroupCalback() {
        return userGroupInfoProducer.produceCallback();
    }

    @Produces
    public UserInfo produceUserInfo() {
        return userGroupInfoProducer.produceUserInfo();
    }

    @Produces
    @Named("Logs")
    public TaskLifeCycleEventListener produceTaskAuditListener() {
        return new JPATaskLifeCycleEventListener(true);
    }

    @Produces
    public DeploymentService getDeploymentService() {
        return this.deploymentService;
    }

    @Produces
    public IdentityProvider produceIdentityProvider {
        return new IdentityProvider() {
             // implement IdentityProvider
        };
    }
}
----

Then beans.xml for the application should enable proper alternative for user group callback (that will be taken based on @Selectable qualifier)

[source,xml]
----
<beans xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee https://docs.jboss.org/cdi/beans_1_0.xsd">

  <alternatives>
    <class>org.jbpm.kie.services.cdi.producer.JAASUserGroupInfoProducer</class>
  </alternatives>

</beans>
----



[NOTE]
====
org.jbpm.kie.services.cdi.producer.JAASUserGroupInfoProducer is just an example here which usually is the good fit for JBoss Application Server to reuse security settings on application server regardless of what it actually is (LDAP, DB, etc). Check Human Task section for more alternatives for UserGroupCallback.
====

Optionally there can be several other producers provided to deliver:

* WorkItemHandlers
* Process, Agenda, WorkingMemory event listeners

These components can be provided by implementing following interfaces

[source,java]
----
/**
 * Allows to provide custom implementations to deliver WorkItem name and WorkItemHandler instance pairs
 * for the runtime.
 * <br/>
 * It will be invoked by RegisterableItemsFactory implementation (especially InjectableRegisterableItemsFactory 
 * in CDI world) for every KieSession. Recommendation is to always produce new instances to avoid unexpected 
 * results. 
 *
 */
public interface WorkItemHandlerProducer {

    /**
     * Returns map of (key = work item name, value work item handler instance) of work items 
     * to be registered on KieSession
     * <br/>
     * Parameters that might be given are as follows:
     * <ul>
     *  <li>ksession</li>
     *  <li>taskService</li>
     *  <li>runtimeManager</li>
     * </ul>
     * 
     * @param identifier - identifier of the owner - usually RuntimeManager that allows the producer to filter out
     * and provide valid instances for given owner
     * @param params - owner might provide some parameters, usually KieSession, TaskService, RuntimeManager instances
     * @return map of work item handler instances (recommendation is to always return new instances when this method is invoked)
     */
    Map<String, WorkItemHandler> getWorkItemHandlers(String identifier, Map<String, Object> params);
}
----

and

[source,java]
----
/**
 * Allows do define custom producers for know EventListeners. Intention of this is that there might be several 
 * implementations that might provide different listener instance based on the context they are executed in. 
 * <br/>
 * It will be invoked by RegisterableItemsFactory implementation (especially InjectableRegisterableItemsFactory 
 * in CDI world) for every KieSession. Recommendation is to always produce new instances to avoid unexpected 
 * results.
 *
 * @param <T> type of the event listener - ProcessEventListener, AgendaEventListener, WorkingMemoryEventListener
 */
public interface EventListenerProducer<T> {

    /**
     * Returns list of instances for given (T) type of listeners
     * <br/>
     * Parameters that might be given are as follows:
     * <ul>
     *  <li>ksession</li>
     *  <li>taskService</li>
     *  <li>runtimeManager</li>
     * </ul>
     * @param identifier - identifier of the owner - usually RuntimeManager that allows the producer to filter out
     * and provide valid instances for given owner
     * @param params - owner might provide some parameters, usually KieSession, TaskService, RuntimeManager instances
     * @return list of listener instances (recommendation is to always return new instances when this method is invoked)
     */
    List<T> getEventListeners(String identifier, Map<String, Object>  params);
}
----

Beans implementing these two interfaces will be collected on runtime and consulted when building KieSession by RuntimeManager.
See RuntimeManager section for more details on this.

A complete runnable example of application built with CDI can be found https://github.com/jsvitak/jbpm-6-examples/tree/master/rewards-cdi-jsf[here].

== RuntimeManager as CDI bean

[NOTE]
====
Even though RuntimeManager can be directly injected, it's recommended to utilize jbpm services when frameworks like CDI, ejb or Spring is used.
jBPM services bring in significant amount of features that encapsulate best practices when using RuntimeManager.
====

RuntimeManager itself can be injected as CDI bean into any other CDI bean within the application.
It has then requirement to get RungimeEnvironment properly produces to allow RuntimeManager to be correctly initialized.
RuntimeManager comes with three predefined strategies and each of them gets CDI qualifier so it can be referenced:

* @Singleton
* @PerRequest
* @PerProcessInstance

Producer that was defined in Configuration section should be now enhanced with producer methods to provide RuntimeEnvironment

[source,java]
----
public class EnvironmentProducer { 
   
    //add same producers as for services

    @Produces
    @Singleton
    @PerRequest
    @PerProcessInstance
    public RuntimeEnvironment produceEnvironment(EntityManagerFactory emf) {
        
        RuntimeEnvironment environment = RuntimeEnvironmentBuilder.Factory.get()
                .newDefaultBuilder()
                .entityManagerFactory(emf)
                .userGroupCallback(getUserGroupCallback())
                .registerableItemsFactory(InjectableRegisterableItemsFactory.getFactory(beanManager, null))
                .addAsset(ResourceFactory.newClassPathResource("BPMN2-ScriptTask.bpmn2"), ResourceType.BPMN2)
                .addAsset(ResourceFactory.newClassPathResource("BPMN2-UserTask.bpmn2"), ResourceType.BPMN2)
                .get();
        return environment;
    }
}
----

In this example single producer method is capable of providing RuntimeEnvironment for all strategies of RuntimeManager by specifying all qualifiers on the method level.

Once complete producer is available, RuntimeManager can be injected into application's CDi bean

[source,java]
----
public class ProcessEngine {

    @Inject
    @Singleton
    private RuntimeManager singletonManager;

    public void startProcess() {
        
        RuntimeEngine runtime = singletonManager.getRuntimeEngine(EmptyContext.get());
        KieSession ksession = runtime.getKieSession();
        
        ProcessInstance processInstance = ksession.startProcess("UserTask");
        
        singletonManager.disposeRuntimeEngine(runtime);     
    }
}
----

That's all what needs to be configured to make use of CDI power with jBPM.

[NOTE]
====
An obvious limitation of injecting directly RuntimeManager via CDI is that there might be only one RuntimeManager in the application.
That in some case can be desired and that's why there is such option.
In general recommended approach is to make use of DeploymentService whenever there is a need to have many RuntimeManagers active within application.
====

As an alternative to DeploymentService, RuntimeManagerFactory can be injected and then RuntimeManager instance can be created manually by the application.
In such case EnvironmentProducer stays same as for DeploymentService and following is an example of simple ProcessEngine bean

[source,java]
----
public class ProcessEngine {

    @Inject
    private RuntimeManagerFactory managerFactory;
    
    @Inject
    private EntityManagerFactory emf;
    
    @Inject
    private BeanManager beanManager;

    public void startProcess() {
        RuntimeEnvironment environment = RuntimeEnvironmentBuilder.Factory.get()
                .newDefaultBuilder()
                .entityManagerFactory(emf)
                .addAsset(ResourceFactory.newClassPathResource("BPMN2-ScriptTask.bpmn2"), ResourceType.BPMN2)
                .addAsset(ResourceFactory.newClassPathResource("BPMN2-UserTask.bpmn2"), ResourceType.BPMN2)
                .registerableItemsFactory(InjectableRegisterableItemsFactory.getFactory(beanManager, null))
                .get();
        
        RuntimeManager manager = managerFactory.newSingletonRuntimeManager(environment);
        RuntimeEngine runtime = manager.getRuntimeEngine(EmptyContext.get());
        KieSession ksession = runtime.getKieSession();
        
        ProcessInstance processInstance = ksession.startProcess("UserTask");
        
        manager.disposeRuntimeEngine(runtime);
        manager.close();     
    }

}
