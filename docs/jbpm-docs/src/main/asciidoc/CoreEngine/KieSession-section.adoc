:imagesdir: ..

Once you've loaded your knowledge base, you should create a session to  interact with the engine.
This session can then be used to start new processes, signal events, etc.
The following code snippet shows how easy it is to create a session based on the previously created knowledge base, and to start a process (by id).

[source,java]
----

KieSession ksession = kbase.newKieSession();
ProcessInstance processInstance = ksession.startProcess("com.sample.MyProcess");
----

== ProcessRuntime

The `ProcessRuntime` interface defines all the session methods for interacting with processes, as shown below.

[source,java]
----

  /**
	 * Start a new process instance.  The process (definition) that should
	 * be used is referenced by the given process id.
	 * 
	 * @param processId  The id of the process that should be started
	 * @return the ProcessInstance that represents the instance of the process that was started
	 */
    ProcessInstance startProcess(String processId);

    /**
	 * Start a new process instance.  The process (definition) that should
	 * be used is referenced by the given process id.  Parameters can be passed
	 * to the process instance (as name-value pairs), and these will be set
	 * as variables of the process instance. 
     * 
	 * @param processId  the id of the process that should be started
     * @param parameters  the process variables that should be set when starting the process instance 
	 * @return the ProcessInstance that represents the instance of the process that was started
     */
    ProcessInstance startProcess(String processId,
                                 Map<String, Object> parameters);

    /**
     * Signals the engine that an event has occurred. The type parameter defines
     * which type of event and the event parameter can contain additional information
     * related to the event.  All process instances that are listening to this type
     * of (external) event will be notified.  For performance reasons, this type of event
     * signaling should only be used if one process instance should be able to notify
     * other process instances. For internal event within one process instance, use the
     * signalEvent method that also include the processInstanceId of the process instance
     * in question. 
     * 
     * @param type the type of event
     * @param event the data associated with this event
     */
    void signalEvent(String type,
                     Object event);

    /**
     * Signals the process instance that an event has occurred. The type parameter defines
     * which type of event and the event parameter can contain additional information
     * related to the event.  All node instances inside the given process instance that

     * will only be processed inside the given process instance.  All other process instances
     * waiting for this type of event will not be notified.
     * 
     * @param type the type of event
     * @param event the data associated with this event
     * @param processInstanceId the id of the process instance that should be signaled
     */
    void signalEvent(String type,
                     Object event,
                     long processInstanceId);

    /**
     * Returns a collection of currently active process instances.  Note that only process
     * instances that are currently loaded and active inside the engine will be returned.
     * When using persistence, it is likely not all running process instances will be loaded
     * as their state will be stored persistently.  It is recommended not to use this
     * method to collect information about the state of your process instances but to use
     * a history log for that purpose.
     * 
     * @return a collection of process instances currently active in the session
     */
    Collection<ProcessInstance> getProcessInstances();

    /**
     * Returns the process instance with the given id.  Note that only active process instances
     * will be returned.  If a process instance has been completed already, this method will return
     * null.
     * 
     * @param id the id of the process instance
     * @return the process instance with the given id or null if it cannot be found
     */
    ProcessInstance getProcessInstance(long processInstanceId);

    /**
     * Aborts the process instance with the given id.  If the process instance has been completed
     * (or aborted), or the process instance cannot be found, this method will throw an
     * IllegalArgumentException.
     * 
     * @param id the id of the process instance
     */
    void abortProcessInstance(long processInstanceId);

    /**
     * Returns the WorkItemManager related to this session.  This can be used to
     * register new WorkItemHandlers or to complete (or abort) WorkItems.
     * 
     * @return the WorkItemManager related to this session
     */
    WorkItemManager getWorkItemManager();
----

== Event Listeners

The session provides methods for registering and removing listeners.
A `ProcessEventListener` can be used to listen to process-related events, like starting or completing a process, entering and leaving a node, etc.
Below, the different methods of the `ProcessEventListener` class are shown.
An event object provides access to related information, like the process instance and node instance linked to the event.
You can use this API to register your own event listeners.

[source,java]
----
public interface ProcessEventListener {

  void beforeProcessStarted( ProcessStartedEvent event );
  void afterProcessStarted( ProcessStartedEvent event );
  void beforeProcessCompleted( ProcessCompletedEvent event );
  void afterProcessCompleted( ProcessCompletedEvent event );
  void beforeNodeTriggered( ProcessNodeTriggeredEvent event );
  void afterNodeTriggered( ProcessNodeTriggeredEvent event );
  void beforeNodeLeft( ProcessNodeLeftEvent event );
  void afterNodeLeft( ProcessNodeLeftEvent event );
  void beforeVariableChanged(ProcessVariableChangedEvent event);
  void afterVariableChanged(ProcessVariableChangedEvent event);

}
----

A note about before and after events: these events typically act like a stack, which means that any events that occur as a direct result of the previous event, will occur between the before and the after of that event.
For example, if a subsequent node is triggered as result of leaving a node, the node triggered events will occur inbetween the beforeNodeLeftEvent and the afterNodeLeftEvent of the node that is left (as the triggering of the second node is a direct result of leaving the first node).  Doing that allows us to derive cause relationships between events more easily.
Similarly, all node triggered and node left events that are the direct result of starting a process will occur between the beforeProcessStarted and afterProcessStarted events.
In general, if you just want to be notified when a particular event occurs, you should be looking at the before events only (as they occur immediately before the event actually occurs). When only looking at the after events, one might get the impression that the events are fired in the wrong order, but because the after events are triggered as a  stack (after events will only fire when all events that were triggered as a result of this event have already fired).  After events should only be used if you want to make sure that all processing related to this has ended (for example, when you want to be notified when starting of a particular process instance has ended.

Also note that not all nodes always generate node triggered and/or node left events.
Depending on the type of node, some nodes might only generate node left events, others might only generate node triggered events.
Catching intermediate events for example are not generating triggered events (they are only generating left events, as they are not really triggered by another node, rather activated from outside).  Similarly, throwing intermediate events are not generating left events (they are only generating  triggered events, as they are not really left, as they have no outgoing connection).

jBPM out-of-the-box provides a listener that can be used to create an audit log (either to the console or the a file on the file system).  This audit log contains all the different events that occurred at runtime so it's easy to figure out what happened.
Note that these loggers should only be used for debugging purposes.
The following logger implementations are supported by default:

. Console logger: This logger writes out all the events to the console.
. File logger: This logger writes out all the events to a file using an XML representation.
  This log file might then be used in the IDE to generate a tree-based visualization of the events that occurred during execution.
. Threaded file logger: Because a file logger writes the events to disk only when closing the logger or when the number of events in the logger reaches a predefined level, it cannot be used when debugging processes at runtime.
  A threaded file logger writes the events to a file after a specified time interval, making it possible to use the logger to visualize the progress in realtime, while debugging processes. 

The `KieServices` lets you add a `KieRuntimeLogger` to your session, as shown below.
When creating a console logger, the knowledge session for which the logger needs to be created must be passed as an argument.
The file logger also requires the name of the log file to be created, and the threaded file logger requires the interval (in milliseconds) after which the events should be saved.
You should always close the logger at the end of your application.

[source,java]
----

  import org.kie.api.KieServices;
  import org.kie.api.logger.KieRuntimeLogger;
  ...
  KieRuntimeLogger logger = KieServices.Factory.get().getLoggers().newFileLogger(ksession, "test");
  // add invocations to the process engine here,
  // e.g. ksession.startProcess(processId);
  ...
  logger.close();
----

The log file that is created by the file-based loggers contains an XML-based overview of all the events that occurred at runtime.
It can be opened in Eclipse,  using the Audit View in the Drools Eclipse plugin, where the events are visualized as a tree.
Events that occur between the before and after event are shown as children of that event.
The following screenshot shows a simple example, where a process is started, resulting in the activation of the Start node, an Action node and an End node, after which the process was completed.

== Correlation Keys

A common requirement when working with processes is ability to assign a given process instance some sort of business identifier that can be later on referenced without knowing the actual (generated) id of the process instance.
To provide such capabilities, jBPM allows to use CorrelationKey that is composed of CorrelationProperties.
CorrelationKey can have either single property describing it (which is in most cases) but it can be represented as multi valued properties set.

Correlation capabilities are provided as part of interface 
[source,java]
----
CorrelationAwareProcessRuntime
---- 

that exposes following methods: 

[source,java]
----

      /**
      * Start a new process instance.  The process (definition) that should
      * be used is referenced by the given process id.  Parameters can be passed
      * to the process instance (as name-value pairs), and these will be set
      * as variables of the process instance.
      *
      * @param processId  the id of the process that should be started
      * @param correlationKey custom correlation key that can be used to identify process instance
      * @param parameters  the process variables that should be set when starting the process instance
      * @return the ProcessInstance that represents the instance of the process that was started
      */
      ProcessInstance startProcess(String processId, CorrelationKey correlationKey, Map<String, Object> parameters);

      /**
      * Creates a new process instance (but does not yet start it).  The process
      * (definition) that should be used is referenced by the given process id.
      * Parameters can be passed to the process instance (as name-value pairs),
      * and these will be set as variables of the process instance.  You should only
      * use this method if you need a reference to the process instance before actually
      * starting it.  Otherwise, use startProcess.
      *
      * @param processId  the id of the process that should be started
      * @param correlationKey custom correlation key that can be used to identify process instance
      * @param parameters  the process variables that should be set when creating the process instance
      * @return the ProcessInstance that represents the instance of the process that was created (but not yet started)
      */
      ProcessInstance createProcessInstance(String processId, CorrelationKey correlationKey, Map<String, Object> parameters);

      /**
      * Returns the process instance with the given correlationKey.  Note that only active process instances
      * will be returned.  If a process instance has been completed already, this method will return
      * null.
      *
      * @param correlationKey the custom correlation key assigned when process instance was created
      * @return the process instance with the given id or null if it cannot be found
      */
      ProcessInstance getProcessInstance(CorrelationKey correlationKey);
----

Correlation is usually used with long running processes and thus require persistence to be enabled to be able to permanently store correlation information.

== Threads

In the following text, we will refer to two types of "multi-threading":  _logical_ and _technical_.
 _Technical multi-threading_ is what happens when multiple  threads or processes are started on a computer, for example by a Java or  C program. _Logical multi-threading_ is what we see in  a BPM process after the process reaches a parallel gateway, for  example.
From a functional standpoint, the original process will then split  into two processes that are executed in a parallel fashion.

Of course, the jBPM engine supports logical multi-threading: for example,  processes that include a parallel gateway.
We've chosen to implement logical  multi-threading using one thread: a jBPM process that includes logical multi-threading  will only be executed in one technical thread.
The main reason for doing  this is that multiple (technical) threads need to be be able to communicate  state information with each other if they are working on the same process.
This requirement brings with it a number of complications.
While it might  seem that multi-threading would bring performance benefits with it, the extra  logic needed to make sure the different threads work together well means  that this is not guaranteed.
There is also the extra overhead incurred because  we need to avoid race conditions and deadlocks.

In general, the jBPM engine executes actions in serial.
For example,  when the engine encounters a script task in a process, it will synchronously  execute that script and wait for it to complete before continuing execution.
Similarly, if a process encounters a parallel gateway, it will sequentially  trigger each of the outgoing branches, one after the other.
This is possible  since execution is almost always instantaneous, meaning that it is extremely  fast and produces almost no overhead.
As a result, the user will usually  not even notice this.
Similarly, action scripts in a process are also synchronously executed, and the engine will wait for them to finish before continuing the  process.
For example, doing a `Thread.sleep(...)` as part of  a script will not make the engine continue execution elsewhere but will  block the engine thread during that period.

The same principle applies to service tasks.
When a service task is  reached in a process, the engine will also invoke the handler of this service  synchronously.
The engine will wait for the `completeWorkItem(...)`  method to return before continuing execution.
It is important that your  service handler executes your service asynchronously if its execution is  not instantaneous.

An example of this would be a service task that invokes an external  service.
Since the delay in invoking this service remotely and waiting for  the results might be too long, it might be a good idea to invoke this service  asynchronously.
This means that the handler will only invoke the service  and will notify the engine later when the results are available.
In the  mean time, the process engine then continues execution of the process.
 

Human tasks are a typical example of a service that needs to be invoked  asynchronously, as we don't want the engine to wait until a human actor  has responded to the request.
The human task handler will only create a new task  (on the task list of the assigned actor) when the human task node is triggered.
The engine will then be able to continue execution on the rest of the process  (if necessary) and the handler will notify the engine asynchronously when  the user has completed the task.
