Designer includes a number of system properties which you can use to customize its functionality. In this section we
go through each one and explain what it does and how you can use it.

== System Properties
System properties and their values can be set on appserver starup with the

Default is true.

|*org.jbpm.designer.formstype*
|Sets the type of process/task forms to be generated/edited. If not set Designer will ask users to choose the type (".form", ".frm").
By setting this property you declare to use one of these two form types and users will no longer be asked to choose.
| "form" / "frm"

|*designer.preprocess*
|Designer performs a number of pre-processing steps before it displays the process model. These include install of default workitem definitions, icons, etc.
Allows you to completely disable these pre-processing steps. Use caution when setting this to false as it will affect Designer functioning properly within the workbench.
Default is true.
| true / false

|*designer.skin*
|Allows users to choose between pre-defined Designer color themes. Default is "default".
| "default" / "olive" / "purple" / "slickness"

|*org.jbpm.service.repository*
|You can pre-install a number of custom workitems on server startup so they are available for the users in addition to the default ones
Designer installs during the pre-processing steps. This property allows you to set a location to your service repository.
| location to your repository, for example http://www.myservicerepository.org/repo or file://my/service/repo

|*org.jbpm.service.servicetasknames*
|Comma-separated list of custom workitem names which you would like to be installed on server startup. Names have to match
the "name" attribute as defined in your workitem definition and exist in the repository defined by
system property *org.jbpm.service.repository*
| comma-separated string, for example "MyWorkitem, MyOtherWorkitem, ..."

|*designerdataobjects*
|Can be used to enable/disable of BPMN2 Data Object nodes to be present or not in the shape menu. Default is "true".
| "true" / "false"

== Development System Properties
These system properties are designed for development purposes only. It is recommended not to set/change them
in production environments.
Designer includes an api abstraction ontop of the workbench file repository. Via these development properties
you can define an alternative repository for business process data. Again in order for Designer to play along
nicely in the workbench it is recommended not set these unless in a development environment.
