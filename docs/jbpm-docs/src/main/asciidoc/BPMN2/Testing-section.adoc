:imagesdir: ..

Even though business processes aren't code (we even recommend you to make them as high-level as possible and to avoid adding implementation details), they also have a life cycle like other development artefacts.
And since business processes can be updated dynamically, testing them (so that you don't break any use cases when doing a modification) is really important as well.

== Unit testing

When unit testing your process, you test whether the process behaves as expected in specific use cases, for example test the output based on the existing input.
To simplify unit testing, jBPM includes a helper class called *JbpmJUnitBaseTestCase* (in the jbpm-test module) that you can use to greatly simplify your JUnit testing, by offering:

* helper methods to create a new RuntimeManager and RuntimeEngine for a given (set of) process(es)

** you can select whether you want to use persistence or not


* assert statements to check

** the state of a process instance (active, completed, aborted)
** which node instances are currently active
** which nodes have been triggered (to check the path that has been followed)
** get the value of variables


For example, consider the following "hello world" process containing a start event, a script task and an end event.
The following JUnit test will create a new session, start the process and then verify whether the process instance completed successfully and whether these three nodes have been executed.

public class ProcessPersistenceTest extends JbpmJUnitBaseTestCase {

    public ProcessPersistenceTest() {
        // setup data source, enable persistence
        super(true, true);
    }

    @Test
    public void testProcess() {
        // create runtime manager with single process - hello.bpmn
        createRuntimeManager("hello.bpmn");
 
        // take RuntimeManager to work with process engine
        RuntimeEngine runtimeEngine = getRuntimeEngine();

        // get access to KieSession instance
        KieSession ksession = runtimeEngine.getKieSession();

        // start process
        ProcessInstance processInstance = ksession.startProcess("com.sample.bpmn.hello");

        // check whether the process instance has completed successfully
        assertProcessInstanceCompleted(processInstance.getId(), ksession);

        // check what nodes have been triggered
        assertNodeTriggered(processInstance.getId(), "StartProcess", "Hello", "EndProcess");
    }
}

JbpmJUnitBaseTestCase acts as base test case class that shall be used for jBPM related tests.
It provides four usage areas:

* JUnit life cycle methods

** setUp: executed @Before and configures data source and EntityManagerFactory, cleans up Singleton's session id
** tearDown: executed @After and clears out history, closes EntityManagerFactory and data source, disposes RuntimeEngines and RuntimeManager

* Knowledge Base and KnowledgeSession management methods

** createRuntimeManager creates RuntimeManager for given set of assets and selected strategy
** disposeRuntimeManager disposes RuntimeManager currently active in the scope of test
** getRuntimeEngine creates new RuntimeEngine for given context

* Assertions

** assertProcessInstanceCompleted
** assertProcessInstanceAborted
** assertProcessInstanceActive
** assertNodeActive
** assertNodeTriggered
** assertProcessVarExists
** assertNodeExists
** assertVersionEquals
** assertProcessNameEquals

* Helper methods

** getDs - returns currently configured data source
** getEmf - returns currently configured EntityManagerFactory
** getTestWorkItemHandler - returns test work item handler that might be registered in addition to what is registered by default
** clearHistory - clears history log
** setupPoolingDataSource - sets up data source


JbpmJUnitBaseTestCase supports all three predefined RuntimeManager strategies as part of the unit testing.
It's enough to specify which strategy shall be used whenever creating runtime manager as part of single test:

public class ProcessHumanTaskTest extends JbpmJUnitBaseTestCase {
    
    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(ProcessHumanTaskTest.class);

    public ProcessHumanTaskTest() {
        super(true, false);
    }
    
    @Test
    public void testProcessProcessInstanceStrategy() {
        RuntimeManager manager = createRuntimeManager(Strategy.PROCESS_INSTANCE, "manager", "humantask.bpmn");
        RuntimeEngine runtimeEngine = getRuntimeEngine(ProcessInstanceIdContext.get());
        KieSession ksession = runtimeEngine.getKieSession();
        TaskService taskService = runtimeEngine.getTaskService();
        
        int ksessionID = ksession.getId();
        ProcessInstance processInstance = ksession.startProcess("com.sample.bpmn.hello");

        assertProcessInstanceActive(processInstance.getId(), ksession);
        assertNodeTriggered(processInstance.getId(), "Start", "Task 1");
        
        manager.disposeRuntimeEngine(runtimeEngine);
        runtimeEngine = getRuntimeEngine(ProcessInstanceIdContext.get(processInstance.getId()));
        
        ksession = runtimeEngine.getKieSession();
        taskService = runtimeEngine.getTaskService();
        
        assertEquals(ksessionID, ksession.getId());
        
        // let john execute Task 1
        List<TaskSummary> list = taskService.getTasksAssignedAsPotentialOwner("john", "en-UK");
        TaskSummary task = list.get(0);
        logger.info("John is executing task {}", task.getName());
        taskService.start(task.getId(), "john");
        taskService.complete(task.getId(), "john", null);

        assertNodeTriggered(processInstance.getId(), "Task 2");
        
        // let mary execute Task 2
        list = taskService.getTasksAssignedAsPotentialOwner("mary", "en-UK");
        task = list.get(0);
        logger.info("Mary is executing task {}", task.getName());
        taskService.start(task.getId(), "mary");
        taskService.complete(task.getId(), "mary", null);

        assertNodeTriggered(processInstance.getId(), "End");
        assertProcessInstanceCompleted(processInstance.getId(), ksession);
    }
}

Above is more complete example that uses PerProcessInstance runtime manager strategy and uses task service to deal with user tasks.

=== Testing integration with external services

Real-life business processes typically include the invocation of external services (like for example a human task service, an email server or your own domain-specific services). One of the advantages of our domain-specific process approach is that you can specify yourself how to actually execute your own domain-specific nodes, by registering a handler.
And this handler can be different depending on your context, allowing you to use testing handlers for unit testing your process.
When you are unit testing your business process, you can register test handlers that then verify whether specific services are requested correctly, and provide test responses for those services.
For example, imagine you have an email node or a human task as part of your process.
When unit testing, you don't want to send out an actual email but rather test whether the email that is requested contains the correct information (for example the right to email, a personalized body, etc.).

A TestWorkItemHandler is provided by default that can be registered to collect all work items (a work item represents one unit of work, like for example sending one specific email or invoking one specific service and contains all the data related to that task) for a given type.
This test handler can then be queried during unit testing to check whether specific work was actually requested during the execution of the process and that the data associated with the work was correct.

The following example describes how a process that sends out an email could be tested.
This test case in particular will test whether an exception is raised when the email could not be sent (which is simulated by notifying the engine that the sending the email could not be completed). The test case uses a test handler that simply registers when an email was requested (and allows you to test the data related to the email like from, to, etc.). Once the engine has been notified the email could not be sent (using abortWorkItem(..)), the unit test verifies that the process handles this case successfully by logging this and generating an error, which aborts the process instance in this case.

[source,java]
----
public void testProcess2() {

    // create runtime manager with single process - hello.bpmn
    createRuntimeManager("sample-process.bpmn");
    // take RuntimeManager to work with process engine
    RuntimeEngine runtimeEngine = getRuntimeEngine();

    // get access to KieSession instance
    KieSession ksession = runtimeEngine.getKieSession();

    // register a test handler for "Email"
    TestWorkItemHandler testHandler = getTestWorkItemHandler();

    ksession.getWorkItemManager().registerWorkItemHandler("Email", testHandler);

    // start the process
    ProcessInstance processInstance = ksession.startProcess("com.sample.bpmn.hello2");

    assertProcessInstanceActive(processInstance.getId(), ksession);
    assertNodeTriggered(processInstance.getId(), "StartProcess", "Email");

    // check whether the email has been requested
    WorkItem workItem = testHandler.getWorkItem();
    assertNotNull(workItem);
    assertEquals("Email", workItem.getName());
    assertEquals("me@mail.com", workItem.getParameter("From"));
    assertEquals("you@mail.com", workItem.getParameter("To"));

    // notify the engine the email has been sent
    ksession.getWorkItemManager().abortWorkItem(workItem.getId());
    assertProcessInstanceAborted(processInstance.getId(), ksession);
    assertNodeTriggered(processInstance.getId(), "Gateway", "Failed", "Error");

}

=== Configuring persistence

You can configure whether you want to execute the JUnit tests using persistence or not.
By default, the JUnit tests will use persistence, meaning that the state of all process instances will be stored in a (in-memory H2) database (which is started by the JUnit test during setup) and a history log will be used to check assertions related to execution history.
When persistence is not used, process instances will only live in memory and an in-memory logger is used for history assertions.

Persistence (and setup of data source) is controlled by the super constructor and allows following

* default, no arg constructor - the most simple test case configuration (does NOT initialize data source and does NOT configure session persistence) - this is usually used for in memory process management, without human task interaction
* super(boolean, boolean) - allows to explicitly configure persistence and data source.
  This is the most common way of bootstrapping test cases for jBPM

** super(true, false) - to execute with in memory process management with human tasks persistence
** super(true, true) - to execute with persistent process management with human tasks persistence
* super(boolean, boolean, string) - same as super(boolean, boolean) but allows to use another persistence unit name than default (org.jbpm.persistence.jpa)
