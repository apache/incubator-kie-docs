= Events

== Start event

.Start event

The start of the process.
A process should have exactly one start node (none start node which does not have event definitions), which cannot have incoming connections and should have one outgoing connection.
Whenever a process is started, execution will start at this node and  automatically continue to the first node linked to this start event, and so on.
It contains the following properties:

* __Id__: The id of the node (which is unique within one node container).
* __Name__: The display name of the node.

== End events

=== End event

.End event

The end of the process.
A process should have one or more end events.
The End Event should have one incoming connection and cannot have any outgoing connections.
It contains the following properties:

* __Id__: The id of the node (which is unique within one node container).
* __Name__: The display name of the node.
* __Terminate__: An End Event can terminate the entire process or just the path.
  When a process instance is terminated, it means its state is set to completed and all other nodes  that might still be active (on parallel paths) in this process instance are canceled.
  Non-terminating end events are simply end for this path (execution of this branch will end here), but other parallel paths can still continue.
  A process instance will automatically complete if there are no more active paths inside that process instance (for example, if a process instance reaches a non-terminating end node but there are no more active branches inside the process instance, the process instance will be completed anyway).  Terminating end events are visualized using a full circle inside the event node, non-terminating event nodes are empty.
  Note that, if you use a terminating event node inside a sub-process, you are terminating just that sub-process and top level continues.

=== Throwing error event

.Throwing error event

An Error Event can be used to signal an exceptional condition in the process.
It should have one incoming connection and no outgoing connections.
When an Error Event is reached in the process, it will throw an error with the given name.
The process will search for an appropriate error handler that is capable of handling this kind of fault.
If no error handler is found, the process instance will be aborted.
An Error Event contains the following properties:

* __Id__: The id of the node (which is unique within one node container).
* __Name__: The display name of the node.
* __FaultName__: The name of the fault.
  This name is used to search for appropriate exception handlers that are capable of handling this kind of fault.
* __FaultVariable__: The name of the variable that contains the data associated with this fault.
  This data is also passed on to the exception handler (if one is found).

Error handlers can be specified using boundary events.

== Intermediate events

=== Catching timer event

.Catching timer event

Represents a timer that can trigger one or multiple times after a given period of time.
A Timer Event should have one incoming connection and one outgoing connection.
The timer delay specifies how long the timer should wait before triggering the first time.
When a Timer Event is reached in the process, it will start the associated timer.
The timer is canceled if the timer node is canceled (e.g., by completing or aborting the enclosing process instance). Consult the section "`<<_sec.timers>>`" for more information.
The Timer Event contains the following properties:

* __Id__: The id of the node (which is unique within one node container).
* __Name__: The display name of the node.
* __Timer delay__: The delay that the node should wait before triggering the first time.
  The expression should be of the form ``[#d][#h][#m][#s][#[ms]]``.
  This allows you to specify the number of days, hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds (which is the default if you don't specify anything). For example, the expression "1h" will wait one hour before triggering the timer.
  The expression could also use #{expr} to dynamically derive the delay based on some process variable.
  Expr in this case could be a process variable, or a more complex expression based on a process variable (e.g.
  myVariable.getValue()). It does support CRON like expression as well.
* __Timer period__: The period between two subsequent triggers.
  If the period is 0, the timer should only be triggered once.
  The expression should be of the form ``[#d][#h][#m][#s][#[ms]]``.
  You can specify the number of days, hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds (which is the default if you don't specify anything).  For example, the expression "1h" will wait one hour before triggering the timer again.
  The expression could also use #{expr} to dynamically derive the period based on some process variable.
  Expr in this case could be a process variable, or a more complex expression based on a process variable (e.g.
  myVariable.getValue()).

Timer events could also be specified as boundary events on sub-processes and tasks that are not automatic tasks like script task that have no wait state as timer will not have a change to fire before task completion.

=== Catching signal event

.Catching signal event
image::Chapter-5-CoreEngine/IntermediateSignalEvent.png[]

A Signal Event can be used to respond to internal or external events during the execution of the process.
A Signal Event should have one incoming connections and one outgoing connection.
It specifies the type of event that is expected.
Whenever that type of event is detected, the node connected to this event node will be triggered.
It contains the following properties:

* __Id__: The id of the node (which is unique within one node container).
* __Name__: The display name of the node.
* __EventType__: The type of event that is  expected.
* __VariableName__: The name of the variable that will contain the data associated with this event (if any) when this event occurs.

A process instance can be signaled that a specific event occurred using

[source,java]
----
ksession.signalEvent(eventType, data, processInstanceId)
----

This will trigger all (active) signal event nodes in the given process instance that are waiting for that event type.
Data related to the event can be passed using the data parameter.
If the event node specifies a variable name, this data will be copied to that variable when the event occurs.

It is also possible to use event nodes inside sub-processes.
These event nodes will however only be active when the sub-process is active.

You can also generate a signal from inside a process instance.
A script (in a script task or using on entry or on exit actions) can use

[source,java]
----
kcontext.getKieRuntime().signalEvent(eventType, data, kcontext.getProcessInstance().getId());
----

A throwing signal event could also be used to model the signaling of an event.
