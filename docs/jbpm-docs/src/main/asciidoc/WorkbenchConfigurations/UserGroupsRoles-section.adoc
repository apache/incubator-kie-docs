By default the KIE-Workbench uses the JBoss AS configured users to work.
In order to create a new user we need to use the ./add-user.sh script located inside the /bin/ directory.
Using this script we will be creating all the users required by our business processes, and for that reason we will be also assigning them groups and roles.

As you can see in the previous image, using the ./add-user.sh script you can create a new user for the Application User (first two options: option B, and empty realm). Note that you need to use different strings for the user name and for the password.
For now you can create users with role admin, so it will have access to all the screens of the tool and then you can write the groups where the user belongs.
In this case the user salaboy has Role: admin and he belongs to the IT group.
There are some restricted words that cannot be used as group names.
For now avoid using "`analyst`", "`admin`", "`developer`" for group names.
