= Jobs Management


The Jobs page allows you to monitor and trigger Asynchronous Jobs scheduled to the jBPM Executor Service.
You can access to the *Jobs* option from the *Manage* top level menu of the jBPM Workbench.

The Jobs List shows all the Jobs that were scheduled and their status.
The Filter on top of the table  helps the administrator to monitor the Jobs execution and take corrective actions in case of Failure.
Check the jBPM Executor section of the documentation for more information.

Administrators can also schedule manually new Jobs from the User Interface via the Actions -> Settings option.
By specifying the command class name and the parameters needed to run the command a new Job can be created.
This manually created jobs will not be associated with any process instance.
Notice also that the Due Date parameter allows the execution to be deferred for the future.
If the Due Date is the time of scheduling the jBPM Executor Service will execute the command as soon as there is an Executor Thread available.
The number of retries will help the command to be executed more than once if it fails.
This can help in situations when the business logic requires an external service to be called where the runtime cannot rely on that service to be available 100% of the time.
