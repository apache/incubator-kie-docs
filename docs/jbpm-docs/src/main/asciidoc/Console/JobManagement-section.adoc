= Jobs Management


The Jobs page allows you to monitor and trigger Asynchronous Jobs scheduled to the jBPM Executor Service.
You can access to the *Jobs* option from the *Manage* top level menu of the jBPM Workbench.

The Jobs List shows all the Jobs that were scheduled and their status.
The Filter on top of the table  helps the administrator to monitor the Jobs execution and take corrective actions in case of Failure.
Check the jBPM Executor section of the documentation for more information.

== Bulk actions

The jobs list provides now a way to perform actions over multiple jobs, in a single operation.
After one or more jobs are selected from the list, the bulk actions menu becomes available, with all supported actions.
The available operations in this screen are 'Cancel' and 'Requeue'. If that operation is not allowed, regarding the job status,
over any of the selected item, a notification is displayed and the operation is not executed on that item.

Administrators can also manually schedule new Jobs from the User Interface via the *New Job* option.
By specifying the command class name and the parameters needed to run the command a new Job can be scheduled to run immediately or at later time.
Any job created manually, will not be associated with any process instance.
Notice also that the Due Date parameter allows the execution to be deferred for a later time in the future.
If the Due Date is set to *Run now*, the jBPM Executor Service will execute the command as soon as there is an Executor Thread available.
The number of retries will help the command to be executed more than once if it fails.
This can help in situations when the business logic requires an external service to be called where the runtime cannot rely on that service to be available 100% of the time.
