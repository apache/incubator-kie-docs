This chapter describes the screens related with the creation and management of  process definitions and process instances.
 

Once you have modelled, configured all the technical details and build and deployed your projects containing your business processes you  should be able to see all the available process definitions in the Process Definition List.
For all the process definitions listed in the  Process Definitions List you will be able to inspect the Process Definition details and start as many Process Instances as needed.
The following sections describes the features provided by all the screens in charge of the manipulation of process definitions and process instances.
You can find these screens under the *Process Management* Menu, in the jBPM Console NG or in KIE Workbench. 

You can find the source code related with the process definition and instances manupilation inside this module: http://github.com/kiegroup/jbpm-wb/tree/master/jbpm-wb-process-runtime[

== Process Definitions

The process definition section is composed by two main screens: the Process Definition Lists and the Process Definition Details.

=== The Process Definition List

The process definition list shows all the available process definitions that were deployed into the platform.
Look at the Deployments section for more information about how to check all the deployment units available in the platform runtime.


image::Console/img/process-definitions-list.png[]

You can click in the list rows to access to the details of the process definition. You can also look at all the process
instances for the selected process definition selecting 'View Process Instances' action.

=== The Process Definition Details

The process definition details shows all the available information about the process definition.
You can consider this screen as a brief about the process model.
You can quickly see if there is a Sub Process associated with it, or how many users and groups are participating in the selected definition.

image::Console/img/process-definitions-details.png[]

Notice that you can View the Process Model (Read Only mode) selecting 'Diagram' tab .

=== Creating Process Instances

You can create new Process Instances from the Process Definition List (Action Column), from the Process Definition Detail view or from the Process Instance section.

image::Console/img/process-definitions-new-instance.png[]

When you create a Process Instance usually a Form will be presented to introduce the information required by the process to be started.
Once you complete the required information and click on the Submit button, the instance will be created and the details of the Process Instance will be displayed on top of the Process Definition Details.


== Process Instances

The process instances section is composed by two main screens: the Process Instance Lists and the Process Instance Details.
In this case the Process Instance Details provides several tabs with the  runtime information related with the process. 

image::Console/img/process-instances-list.png[]

Each row inside the process instance list represent a running process instance from a particular Process Definition.
Each execution is differentiated from all the others by the internal state of the information that the process is manipulating.
In order to inspect this information you can click in each row to see the process instance details in full screen mode.

image::Console/img/process-instances-details.png[]

=== Process Instance Detail

Let's go throw the different details tabs to see what king of information is provided:

As you can see the Process Instance Detail first tab gives you a quick overview about what is going on inside the process.
This is by showing  the current state of the instance and also the current activity that is being executed.
The process variables tab display all the process variables  that are being manipulated by the instance with the
exception of the variables that contains documents.


image::Console/img/process-instances-variables.png[]

If the process contains a variable of the type: org.jbpm.Document it will be listed in the Documents tab, for easy access, download and manipulation of the attached documents.
Notice that at this point you cannot attach new documents to currently running instances, but this feature will be added in future versions. 


image::Console/img/process-instances-documents.png[]

Finally, the Logs tab shows two types of logs for different end users.
There are two types of Logs available inside the tab: Business and Technical.
 


image::Console/img/process-instances-logs.png[]

To complement the process logs you can open the Process Model that shows the completed activies in grey and the current activities highlighted in red.

=== Process Instance List

This list works with the concept of Management Screen view used along the admin console sections (Jobs, Tasks, Process
 Instance and Execution Errors). We are going to explain how it is defined going throw the process instance list and
 after the generic view description we will describe the process instance list specific behaviour.

==== Console Management list view
We consider this king of view as a set of visualization parameters that modify what items has to be displayed and how
the items have to be shown.

A view embrace

* Columns to be shown
* Items by page
* Sorting by column criteria
* Restrictions over the displayed items listprovided by:
** Quick filter creation
** Saved filters management.
* General actions shared by all item list like 'Refresh'
* Specific actions depending on each screen.

We find here different areas with different purposes: Filtering, general section configuration
and specific view parameter setting in the data grid presentation:

image::Console/img/process-instances-areas.png[]

- (1) Breadcrumb area: Contains breadcrumbs and the server template selector.
- (2) Filters area: Contains a dock for filter creation and a dock with saved filters
The docks are placed in the expandable panel on the left side of the screen.
The selections made inside any of the docks are immediately reflected in the table on the right.

That panels can be expanded or collapsed using the standard workbench docks controls.

*Filter dock*

Contains a set of available filters to create quick filters over the left side panel list.
Allows you to quickly find data related to Process Instances, Jobs, Tasks and Execution Errors.A set of pre defined filters
are defined into the related views. The user is able to restrict the data by adding new active filters.
This can be done by either selecting values from the dropdown list or providing values to the different attributes in
the input box.

You will notice that the data is filtered as you add or remove any of the active filters.

image::Console/img/ConsoleItemListFilters.png[align="center", title="Filters dock opened"]

There are different types of filters:

-- Checkboxes (state and errors on the image):

Allow to select multiple values for one specific field. Any action on checkbox generate and applies that restriction
on the active filter.

-- Filter by:

Dropdown with the available fields to filter. Depending on the kind of field the input box have different
allowed values (numeric or any text)

-- Dropdown filled with specific values. (ie: in this process instances list it is filled with the available Process names)

-- Date fields filter:

Once of the filter box is selected a list of date predefined filters like 'Last Hour', 'Today',.. are displayed, and also
the posibility of define a custom range of dates

image::Console/img/console-datefilter.png[align="left", title="Date field filter opened"]

At the end of this dock there is the option to create a new saved 'Advanced Filter'. When the user selects it, a
"New Item list" popup appears and let to introduce parameters related with the new filter like the name, the description
 and the filter restrictions.

image::Console/img/console-newAdvancedFilter.png[align="left", title="New Advanced filter popup"]

If the view has to include a restriction over a specific column, then the link 'Add new' has to be selected. A drop down
list with all the columns to create restrictions

image::Console/img/console-newAdvancedFilter_2.png[align="left", title="New Advanced filter: select column"]

Once the column is selected, depending of its type, a new dropdown list is open with the kind of restrictions available
for the selected column and the necessary form to add them.

image::Console/img/console-newAdvancedFilter_3.png[align="left", title="New Advanced filter: define condition over selected column"]

One filter can include a list of different conditions over different columns and the editor allow remove each one
clicking th 'x' button near them

Once the view creation parameters are defined, the 'Ok' button launch the defined filter saving and
applies that on the list.

*Saved Filter dock*

The 'Saved filters' dock allows manage the stored filters: It present a list with the current stored filters

image::Console/img/ConsoleItemListSavedFilters.png[align="center", title="Saved filters dock opened"]


*** Filters can be deleted
*** The defaults filters can be always restored as in the previous version with the 'Restore default filters' button.
*** Filters can be applied: When a user selects one filter, that is applied on the current list and the 'Active filters'
 displays the restrictions contained in that filter.

*** The user has the ability to modify/complete filters and save it to be reused later. The new way to save filter
is selecting 'Save filters' at 'Active filters' area. A name for the new saved filter is requested and a new filter
with the current restrictions is added to 'Saved filters' list.

It's not allowed to have filters with the same name. When the user tries to save a filter with an existing name, currently an error is shown.

image::Console/img/ConsoleItemListSavedFiltersError.png[align="center", title="Not allowed save filter with the same existing filter name"]


- (3) Manage screen selector.
The drop-down offers navigation to the all manage screens: Process Definitions, Process Instances, Tasks, Execution Errors
and Jobs have been created. This selector allows the user to switch process admin screens quickly and easily.

image::Console/img/ConsoleManageSelector.png[title="Manage screen selector"]

- (4) Toolbar area.
This toolbar has been designed to contain each screen specific actions and provides different kinds of visualizations:
icons for common actions like 'Refresh' that are self-explained, buttons for primary actions and it's prepared for containing
kebab with a list of available actions.

- (5)  Filter status area.
Shows the currently applied filters and provides options to clear individual filters or to clear
them all. The user has the ability to save the currently applied filter as a new saved filter, which
becomes available in Saved filters dock (see Filters area above)

- (6)  The list table area.
In this area can be done:
** Specific view configuration like. selecting visible columns, specify the number of items by page.
In this area the user can change dynamically the view editable parameters like visible columns, set the sorting column (ASC/DESC)
or set the number of items to show in a page.

image::Console/img/process-instances-column_selector.png[]

The number of items to show in a page can be configurable too, from the page size dropdown list

image::Console/img/process-instances-number-items.png[]

** Bulk actions in some of the management screens like Process Instances, Execution errors the posibility of bulk action
is provided over the selected items. In this case the available actions are 'Abort' or 'Signal'

image::Console/img/process-instances-specific-area.png[]

** Perform actions on individual list item using the kebab button control. When there are more than one available actions
the kebab groups the available actions. There are different areas at kebab: primary actions first and separately
the navigation to other screens ones.

image::Console/img/ConsoleItemList.png[align="center", title="Item list design"]

==== Specific actions for Process Instance List.

The user can perform the following specific action over the process instances:

** Navigate to related tasks
** Navigate to related jobs
** In case there are related errors, navigate to them

image::Console/img/process-instances-error.png[align="center", title="View related error when it exists"]

** Abort process instance(s). This action requires a double confirmation before aborting the instance(s).
** Signal process instance(s). When the action signaling a process instance is performed, a popup is opened asking for
the signal name and signal data. (When this signal is done in a bulk action, the defined signal is used for all selected
process instances.

image::Console/img/process-instance-signal.png[align="center", title="Signal popup"]


==== Special filter in process instance list

There is an specific restriction than makes the process instance list view, have a different behaviour.
This happend when a filter over the column 'PROCESSID' is defined.

In this case, the columns available to show have been incremented with the specified process variables which have value.
The user can then, view process instance variables from a specific process id, in the same grid of the process instances.
