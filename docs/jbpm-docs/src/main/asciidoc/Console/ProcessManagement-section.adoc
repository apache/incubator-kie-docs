This chapter describes the screens related with the creation and management of process definitions and process instances.


Once you have modelled, configured all the technical details and build and deployed your projects containing your business processes you  should be able to see all the available process definitions in the Manage Process Definitions section.
For all the process definitions listed in there you will be able to inspect the Process Definition details and start as many Process Instances as needed.
The following sections describes most features available to manage process definitions and process instances from the jBPM Workbench.
You can find these screens under the *Manage* menu: *Process Definitions* or *Process Instances*, in the jBPM Workbench.

You can find the source code related to the process definition and instances screens in the http://github.com/kiegroup/jbpm-wb/tree/master/jbpm-wb-process-runtime[jbpm-wb-process-runtime] module.
Feel free to report issues, send Pull Requests and get in contact with the team via comments in github.

== Process Definitions Management

The process definition section is composed by two main screens: the Process Definition Lists and the Process Definition Details.

=== Process Definition List

The process definition list shows all the available process definitions that were deployed into the platform.
Look at the Deployments section for more information about how to check all the deployment units available in the platform runtime.

You can click in the items in the list to access the details of the process definition. You can also look at all the process
instances for the selected process definition selecting 'View Process Instances' action.

=== Process Definition Details

The process definition details shows all the available information about the process definition.
You can consider this screen as a brief about the process model.
You can quickly see if there is a Sub Process associated with it, or how many users and groups are participating in the selected definition.

Notice that you can View the Process Model (Read Only mode) selecting 'Diagram' tab .

=== Creating new Process Instances

You can create new Process Instances from the Process Definition List (Action Column), from the Process Definition Detail view or from the Process Instance section.

When you create a Process Instance usually a Form will be presented to introduce the information required by the process to be started.
Once you complete the required information and click on the Submit button, the instance will be created and the details of the Process Instance will be displayed on top of the Process Definition Details.


== Process Instances Management

The process instances section is composed by two main screens: the Process Instance Lists and the Process Instance Details.
In this case the Process Instance Details provides several tabs with the  runtime information related with the process. 

image::Console/img/process-instances-list.png[]

Each row inside the process instance list represent a running process instance from a particular Process Definition.
Each execution is differentiated from all the others by the internal state of the information that the process is manipulating.
In order to inspect this information you can click in each row to see the process instance details in full screen mode.

=== Specific actions

The user can perform the following specific action over the process instances:

** Navigate to related tasks
** Navigate to related jobs
** In case there are related errors, navigate to them

** Abort process instance(s). This action requires a double confirmation before aborting the instance(s).
** Signal process instance(s). When the action signaling a process instance is performed, a popup is opened asking for
the signal name and signal data. (When this signal is done in a bulk action, the defined signal is used for all selected
process instances.

=== Special filter

There is an specific restriction than makes the process instance list view to have a different behaviour.
This happens when a filter over the column 'PROCESSID' is defined.

In this case, the columns available to show have been incremented with the specified process variables which have value.
The user can then, view process instance variables from a specific process id, in the same grid of the process instances.

=== Process Instance Details

Let's go through the different tabs to see what kind of information is provided:

As you can see the *Instance Details* tab gives you a quick overview about what is going on inside the process.
This is by showing the current state of the instance and also the current activity that is being executed.
The *Process Variables* tab displays all the process variables that are being manipulated by the instance with the
exception of the variables that contains documents.

If the process contains a variable of the type: org.jbpm.Document it will be listed in the *Documents* tab, for easy access, download and manipulation of the attached documents.
Please note that at this point you cannot attach new documents to currently running instances, but this feature will be added in future versions. See https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBPM-7572[JBPM-7572].

The *Logs* tab shows two types of logs: Business and Technical.
In the Business view, only the most relevant events from a business perspective are presented.
As for the Technical view, the full list of audit events concerning any node in the process instance is displayed.

Finally, to complement the process logs you can open the *Diagram* tab that shows the completed activities in grey and the current activities highlighted in red.
