:imagesdir: ..

Processes almost always have some kind of data to work with.
The data modeler allows non-technical users to view, edit or create these data models. 

Typically, a business process analyst or data analyst will capture the requirements for a process or application and turn these into a formal set of interrelated data structures.
The new Data Modeler tool provides an easy, straightforward and visual aid for building both logical and physical data models, without the need for advanced development skills or explicit coding.
The data modeler is transparently integrated into the workbench.
Its main goals are to make data models first class citizens in the process improvement cycle and allow for full process automation through the integrated use of data structures (and the forms that will be used to interact with them).
