= 10-Minute Tutorial using the Workbench
:imagesdir: ..


Open up the process management console:

http://localhost:8080/jbpm-console

[NOTE]
====
It could take a minute to start up the AS and web application.
If the web page doesn't show up after a while, make sure you don't have a firewall blocking that port, or another application already using the port 8080.
You can always take a look at the server log jbpm-installer/jboss-as-7.1.1.Final/standalone/log/server.log

Log in, using krisv / krisv as username / password.

Using a prebuilt Evaluation example, the http://people.redhat.com/kverlaen/jbpm6F-installer-console.swf[following screencast] gives an overview of how to manage your process instances.
It shows you: 

* How to build and deploy a process
* How to start a new process instance
* How to look up the current status of a running process instance
* How to look up your tasks
* How to complete a task
* How to generate reports to monitor your process execution

The workbench supports the entire life cycle of your business processes: authoring, deployment, process management, tasks and dashboards. 

* The project authoring perspective allows you to look at existing repositories, where each project 
  can contain business processes (but also business rules, data models, forms, etc.). By default, 
  the workbench will download two sample playground repositories, containing examples to look at. 
** In this screencast, the Evaluation project inside the jbpm-playground repository is used.
* The project explorer shows all available artifacts:
** evaluation: business process describing the evaluation process as a sequence of tasks
** evaluation-taskform: process form to start the evaluation process
** PerformanceEvaluation-taskform: task form to perform the evaluation tasks
* To make a process available for execution, you need to successfully build and deploy it first.
  To do so, open up the Project Editor (from the Tools menu) and click Build & Deploy.
* To manage your process definitions and instances, click on the "Process Management" menu option 
  at the top menu bar an select one of available options depending on you interest: 
** Process Definitions - lists all available process definitions
** Process Instances - lists all active process instances (allows to show completed,
  aborted as well by changing filter criteria)
* Process definitions panel allow you to start a new process instance by clicking on the "Play" 
  button. The process form (as defined in the project) will be shown, where you need to fill in 
  the necessary information to start the process. In this case, you need to fill the user you want 
  to start an evaluation for (in this case use "krisv") and a reason for the request, after which 
  you can complete the form. Some details about the process instance that was just started will be 
  shown in the process instance details panel. From there you can access additional details: 
** Process model - to visualize current state of the process
** Process variables - to see current values of process variables

+
The process instance that you just started is first requiring a self-evaluation of the user and is 
waiting until the user has completed this task.
* To see the tasks that have been assigned to you, choose the "Tasks" menu option on the top 
  bar and select "Task List" (you may need to click refresh to update your task view).  The personal
  tasks table should show a "Performance Evaluation" task reserved for you. After starting the task,
  you can complete the task, which will open up the task form related to this task. You can fill
  in the necessary data and then complete the form and close the window. After completing the task, you
  could check the "Process Instances" once more to check the progress of your process instance. You
  should be able to see that the process is now waiting for your HR manager and project manager to also
  perform an evaluation. You could log in as "john" / "john" and "mary" / "mary" to complete these
  tasks.
* After starting and/or completing a few process instances and human tasks, you can generate
  a report of what has happened so far. Under "Dashboards", select "Process & Task Dashboard".  
  This is a set of see predefined charts that allow users to spot what is going on in the system.
  Charts can be fully customized as well, as explained in the Business Activity Monitoring chapter.
