= New and Noteworthy in jBPM 7.10.0
:imagesdir: ..

The following features were added to jBPM 7.10

== jBPM Server Full Distribution Docker image

Version 7.10 introduces another way for people to get started very quickly.
As an addition to the http://jbpm.org/learn/gettingStarted.html[single zip distribution] that we recently added on version 7.8.0.Final,
you can now also use the https://hub.docker.com/r/jboss/jbpm-server-full/[jbpm-server-full] Docker image to have a fully configured and running environment.

If you already have https://docs.docker.com/install/[Docker] installed on your local machine, all you need to do is run the following command:

[source]
----
docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 8001:8001 -d --name jbpm-server-full jboss/jbpm-server-full:latest
----

Once container and web applications started, you can navigate to it and login using the username `wbadmin` and password `wbadmin`
or any of the users available in the http://jbpm.org/learn/gettingStarted.html[getting started] document.

    http://localhost:8080/jbpm-console

that's all that is needed to get fully configured and running jBPM distribution that includes:

- WildFly server
- jBPM Console (aka workbench)
- KIE Server
- jBPM Case Management showcase
- jBPM Service repository

Everything configured to work together smoothly and you can access them at following locations:

- jBPM console - http://localhost:8080/jbpm-console
- KIE Server - http://localhost:8080/kie-server/services/rest/server
- KIE Server Swagger docs - http://localhost:8080/kie-server/docs
- jBPM case management - http://localhost:8080/jbpm-casemgmt
- jBPM Service repository - http://localhost:8080/repository

For mode details please read our updated http://jbpm.org/learn/gettingStarted.html[Getting Started] page, where you can find advanced information about using this new Docker image.

== Jobs Management: Added bulk actions

The jobs list provides now a way to perform actions over multiple jobs, in a single operation.
After one or more jobs are selected from the list, the bulk actions menu becomes available, with all supported actions.
The available operations in this screen are 'Cancel' and 'Requeue'. If that operation is not allowed, regarding the job status,
over any of the selected item, a notification is displayed and the operation is not executed on that item.

== Process Instances Management: Further flexibility to access process instance related data

When retrieving process instance data, from one or more Kie Server instances, we used to enforce the rule that only data from active deployment units would be available.
That is not a requirement any longer, as long as the data is persisted in the data base, it is now possible to list and display most of the information for any process instance.
There is no need for the container to be running in order to list process instances in the *Manage Process Instances* area.
Please note that the following data is not available when the deployment unit is not available:

- Process instance diagram: As the actual image is hosted as part of the container resources, it is not possible to display the diagram.
- Process instance variables: Only variables that changed its value during the process execution are listed.
