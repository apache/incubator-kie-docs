= New and Noteworthy in jBPM 7.0.0
:imagesdir: ..

The following features were added to jBPM 7.0

== Business Dashboards

The _Business Dashboards_ section in the top menu bar opens up a new perspective which can be used to
author brand new dashboards.

From this very new perspective, aside from creating new content, it is also possible to change the layout of the top
menu bar by adding, removing or moving entries around. The menu entries are linked to existing perspectives and can
be modified, thus making extremely easy to create and publish new perspectives in the top menu bar.

Altogether, it provides a rich environment which allows for both changes in the application content and its menus. A
detailed introduction to the new solution can be found at the <<_sect_bam_businessdashboards,Business Dashboards>> section.

IMPORTANT: Notice, the former dashboard tooling was a separated web application. The new solution has been
completely rewritten from scratch and it is fully integrated in the workbench.


== Case Management Showcase

A new showcase application that will allow an easy and comprehensive look into case management has been added. This component is
available to allow to have quick and rather complete view at the cases (both definitions and instances).
To make it possible to deal with various type of cases that component was made generic to:

** Bring in visibility to the technical users
** Provide insight in where the case instance is
** Allow to perform certain operations on a case instance which might not be visible to end users through the case app

Case management should be business focused and domain specific to bring in the most value to the end users. With that
purpose, version 7.x brings a set of building blocks, as pieces that are focused in specific case features.

In this version we can find the following _building blocks_:

* _Case List_.
Allows sort and filter the case list, perform general case operations and start new cases.

* _Case Details_.
* _Case Stages_.
* _Case Comments_.
* _Case Roles_.
* _Case Milestones_.
* _Case Overview_.
This building block, provides a generic building block composition and exposes the general
case actions like 'Complete'.

.Case Overview brings a default building block composition

This application can be used standalone or can be automatically provisioned by workbench and accessible from within the workbench UI.

IMPORTANT: The Case Management Showcase application launcher is only available from the workbench UI if the application
has been automatically provisioned or a url has been provided via org.jbpm.casemgmt.showcase.url system property.
