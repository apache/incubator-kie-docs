= New and Noteworthy in jBPM 7.0.0
:imagesdir: ..

The following features were added to jBPM 7.0

== Business Dashboards

The _Business Dashboards_ section in the top menu bar opens up a new perspective which can be used to
author brand new dashboards.

From this very new perspective, aside from creating new content, it is also possible to change the layout of the top
menu bar by adding, removing or moving entries around. The menu entries are linked to existing perspectives and can
be modified, thus making extremely easy to create and publish new perspectives in the top menu bar.

Altogether, it provides a rich environment which allows for both changes in the application content and its menus. A
detailed introduction to the new solution can be found at the <<_sect_bam_businessdashboards,Business Dashboards>> section.

IMPORTANT: Notice, the former dashboard tooling was a separated web application. The new solution has been
completely rewritten from scratch and it is fully integrated in the workbench.
