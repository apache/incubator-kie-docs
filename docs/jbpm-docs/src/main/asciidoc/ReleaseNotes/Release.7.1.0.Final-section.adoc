:imagesdir: ..

The following features were added to jBPM 7.1

== Workbench

The following are the jBPM-specific enhancements made in the workbench.


=== New error handling

Execution errors are now detected and stored by the system (e.g. exceptions while running a process instance or a job once exceeded the max retry number).
The process instance list includes a new column that displays the number of errors which are not marked as acknowledged, for each process instance. When the column is clicked a popup is displayed, which will allow users to navigate to the new error perspective.
