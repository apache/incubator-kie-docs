= New and Noteworthy in jBPM 7.1.0
:imagesdir: ..

The following features were added to jBPM 7.1

== Workbench

The following are the jBPM-specific enhancements made in the workbench.

=== Quick search filters for runtime data

To allow you to quickly find data related to Process Instances, Jobs, Tasks and Errors, a new set of pre defined filters has been introduced into the related views.
These filters are always available in the "Search" tab when you first access any of the pages related to the domain mentioned above.
By default, you will notice that at least one filter is defined. That is done so that only the most relevant data is shown.
You're free to restrict the data even further by adding new filters. This can be done by either selecting values from the dropdown list or proving values to the different attributes in the input box.
You will notice that the data is filtered as you add or remove any of the active filters.

The complete list of views where quick search filters have been added include:

* Process Instances
* Tasks
* Task Administration
* Jobs
* Execution Errors

=== New error handling

Execution errors are now detected and stored by the system (e.g., exceptions while running a process instance or a job once the max retry number has been exceeded).
The process instance list includes a new column that displays the number of errors per process instance which are not marked as acknowledged. When the column is clicked a popup is displayed, which will allow users to navigate to the new error perspective.

=== New Execution Errors View

A new view to explore and acknowledge the new generated execution error has been added.

.Access to the new Execution Errors view

The *Execution Errors* view shows a list of errors. It contains a 'Search' tab that provides quick search capabilities
filtering by the different fields like Process Instance Id, Job Id and Type.

This view also provides a set of predefined filters: All, New (pending of acknowledgement) and Acknowledged.

The unacknowledged errors can be acknowledged singly, selecting the related error action. This new view also allows
 acknowledgment of multiple errors. To acknowledge multiple errors at once, please select all errors you wish to
 acknowledge and use the 'Bulk Acknowledge' button.


=== Advanced Queries with ORDER BY clause

The `QueryService` used in executing advanced queries only supported sorting with ORDER BY clauses having the following pattern:

[source,sql]
----
ORDER BY Column1, Column2, ... ASC|DESC;
----

which limited the sorting to either ascending or descending for all columns.

The desired behavior, that of a full ORDER BY clause

[source,sql]
----
ORDER BY Column1 ASC|DESC, Column2 ASC|DESC, ..., ColumnN ASC|DESC;
----

allowing sort order per column, is now possible.  Please see the documentation for examples of how to apply the new full ORDER BY clause when using the QueryService.
