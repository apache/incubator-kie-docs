= New and Noteworthy in jBPM 7.1.0
:imagesdir: ..

The following features were added to jBPM 7.1

== Workbench

The following are the jBPM-specific enhancements made in the workbench.

=== Quick search filters for runtime data

To allow you to quickly find data related to Process Instances, Jobs, Tasks and Errors, a new set of pre defined filters has been introduced into the related views.
These filters are always available in the "Search" tab when you first access any of the pages related to the domain mentioned above.
By default, you will notice that at least one filter is defined. That is done so that only the most relevant data is shown.
You're free to restrict the data even further by adding new filters. This can be done by either selecting values from the dropdown list or proving values to the different attributes in the input box.
You will notice that the data is filtered as you add or remove any of the active filters.

The complete list of views where quick search filters have been added include:

* Process Instances
* Tasks
* Task Administration
* Jobs
* Execution Errors

=== New error handling

The system now detects and stores execution errors, such as exceptions while running a process instance or a job once the maximum retry number has been exceeded.
The process instance list includes a new column that displays the number of errors per process instance which are not marked as acknowledged. When the column is clicked a popup is displayed, which will allow users to navigate to the new error perspective.

=== New Execution Errors View

A new view to explore and acknowledge the new generated execution error has been added.

.Access to the new Execution Errors view

The *Execution Errors* view shows a list of errors. It contains a 'Search' tab that provides quick search capabilities
filtering by the different fields like Process Instance Id, Job Id and Type.

This view also provides a set of predefined filters: All, New (pending of acknowledgement) and Acknowledged.

The unacknowledged errors can be acknowledged singly, selecting the related error action. This new view also allows
 acknowledgment of multiple errors. To acknowledge multiple errors at once, please select all errors you wish to
 acknowledge and use the 'Bulk Acknowledge' button.


=== New task admin perspective and actions

The former task list perspective has been divided into two:

** Task list perspective: Aims to be used by task operators, in order to work with their assigned (or potentially assigned) tasks.
** Task administration perspective: Designed to be used by administrators, which can manage tasks belonging to other users. This perspective is only available for users with roles **``**admin**``** and **``**process-admin**``**. It is similar to the former "Admin" filter tab on the former task list perspective.

The tasks which are displayed on the task administration perspective are determined by the current user permissions. The list shows the tasks that have the current user or the current user's group associated as business administrator. By default the system associates all tasks to the user **``**Administrator**``** (configured via the **``**org.jbpm.ht.admin.user**``** system property) and the group **``**Administrators**``** (configured via the **``**org.jbpm.ht.admin.group**``** system property), so in order to display all tasks, your **``**admin**``** or **``**process-admin**``** user needs to belong to the **``**Administrators**``** group.

IMPORTANT: Notice that the mentioned roles and group configurations are related to the KIE server's, not the Workbench's (in case they have separate user configurations).


In addition, the Suspend and Resume action buttons have been enabled on both perspectives. They are visible depending on the state of the associated task in regard to the current user.


=== Advanced Queries with ORDER BY clause

The `QueryService` used in executing advanced queries only supported sorting with ORDER BY clauses having the following pattern:

[source,sql]
----
ORDER BY Column1, Column2, ... ASC|DESC;
----

which limited the sorting to either ascending or descending for all columns.

The desired behavior, that of a full ORDER BY clause

[source,sql]
----
ORDER BY Column1 ASC|DESC, Column2 ASC|DESC, ..., ColumnN ASC|DESC;
----

allowing sort order per column, is now possible.  Please see the documentation for examples of how to apply the new full ORDER BY clause when using the QueryService.
