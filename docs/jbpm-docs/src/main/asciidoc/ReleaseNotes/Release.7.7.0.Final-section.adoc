= New and Noteworthy in jBPM 7.7.0
:imagesdir: ..

The following features were added to jBPM 7.7

== jBPM executor redesigned

up to version 7.7, jBPM executor used default mechanism based on polling. It periodically polls data base to check if there are any jobs to be
executed. This does not scale too good and was main motivation to approach redesign. With version 7.7, jBPM executor is enhanced to remove polling mechanism
and instead relies on specialised ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor that respects job's priority.

This allows to have really efficient processing with less load on the data base (and less locks on data base). New mechanism does cover all
possible types of jobs including retries and requeues. With additional JMS trigger (that was already present since version 6.3) this provides
complete and fast asynchronous job processing solution.
To read up more on this see http://mswiderski.blogspot.com/2018/02/redesigned-jbpm-executor.html[this article] and async section in the docs.

== UserInfo interface allows to get user id by email

Small addition to UserInfo interface (and its default implementations) was provided to allow to find user id by email address. This is the reverse
operation that was already there - get email address by user id. With this, email integration (such as completing task by email) can be
easily implemented.
