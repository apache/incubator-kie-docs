= New and Noteworthy in jBPM 7.5.0
:imagesdir: ..

The following features were added to jBPM 7.5

== Case management

jBPM 7.5 brings number of case management improvements.

=== Sub case support

Sub case support is provided as additional activity that can be easily drag and dropped into existing case definitions or even
into regular processes to allow creating case instances from within business process.

It allows to provide all information as for regular start case plus enables users to decide what should happen after case is started.
For more information take a look at this http://mswiderski.blogspot.com/2017/10/sub-cases-for-case-instance-and-process.html[article]

=== Case file and case comment authorization

Access to case file and case comments can be restricted to particular case roles. By default the access is open unless specified
differently.

Access restrictions can be set for comment:

- when adding a comment
- when updating a comment

Access restrictions to case file can be set:

- in case definition
- when starting a case
- when setting case file items

More detailed explanation of this feature can be found http://mswiderski.blogspot.com/2017/10/case-management-improvements-data.html[here]

=== Case close with message

Support for close of case instance was added with optional message. That message will then show up in case instance as outcome message.
It accompanies case abort and destroy operations to provide complete coverage of the possible end states of the case instance.

=== Case comments notifications

Case comments have been equipped with optional support for notifications, by default email notifications with template support.
Whenever any of the case roles is mentioned in the comment (@onwer) email notification will be sent to user or group of users assigned
to that role. See more details in this http://mswiderski.blogspot.com/2017/11/case-management-mention-someone-in.html[article]

== Document list marshalling strategy

A common requirement is to have a list of documents to be handled by business process, jBPM does provide support for physical
documents (e.g. pdf) since version 6 with custom marshalling strategy. Though it only allows to handle single document per process
variable. With version 7.5 there is a new marshalling strategy provided to allow handling list of
documents `org.jbpm.document.marshalling.DocumentsMarshallingStrategy`. It does rely on the `DocumentMarshallingStrategy` to process
individual documents so they are properly stored in document management system.

This marshalling strategy accepts only `org.jbpm.document.Documents` type that represents list of documents.


== Update task metadata and variables in single operation

UserTaskService has been extended to provide operation to update meta data of a task and its input and output data at the same time.
It allows to update following meta data of a task:

- name
- description
- priority
- expiration date
- form name

Same feature is available via KIE Server REST and JMS api.

== Quartz improvements - db job store aware of deployed kjars

Quartz scheduler service has been improved to allow to fetch jobs only for deployments (kie containers) that are currently available in the
running system. This applies only to Quartz setup with data base job store and requires additional changes in quartz configuration file:

....
org.quartz.jobStore.driverDelegateClass=org.jbpm.process.core.timer.impl.quartz.DeploymentsAwareStdJDBCDelegate
....

there is another PostgreSQL delegate class (due to handling of blob data)

....
org.quartz.jobStore.driverDelegateClass=org.jbpm.process.core.timer.impl.quartz.DeploymentsAwarePostgreSQLDelegate
....

they both do the same logic to find next trigger to fire - query for triggers based on trigger group id that now is set to deploymentId of the kjar.

== Move of jBPM work items into dedicated repository

As part of preparation work for revamped Service Repository, some jBPM work items have been moved to dedicated https://github.com/kiegroup/jbpm-work-items[GitHub repository].
This is intended to allow easier contribution from community to build up a comprehensive list of work items that users
can simply import from Service repository and use in their processes.

== XStream security improvements

XStream is used as one of data formats (next to JSON and XML-JAXB) used by KIE Server when interacting with runtimes. It might be  exposed to certain security
issues that could allow to push malicious code over the wire and affect server upon serialization process.
This has been addressed by hardening security policy on XStream instances used by KIE Server marshaller. By default it allows only few selected classes
from KIE projects plus classes found in kjar.

Additional classes can be added to the policy globally by system property *org.kie.server.xstream.enabled.packages* that accepts wildcard expressions.

== KIE Server < - > KIE Controller communication security

KIE server uses either REST or WebSocket to communicate with KIE Controller. Up till now, the only way to provide password was to use system
properties which had certain drawbacks from security stand point. Version 7.5 brings in support for keystore based password storage that
KIE Server and KIE Controller can use on runtime to load password.

Take a look at section 'KIE Execution Server -> Securing password using key store' for more details

== Business rule task fire limit

Business rule task has been enhanced to limit number of fired rules to avoid situation where rules run into infinite loop and make server
completely unresponsive. Fire limit is set by default to 10000 and can be configured:

 - globally (per JVM) via system property *org.jbpm.rule.task.firelimit*
 - per business rule task via data input named *FireRuleLimit*


in case fire rule limit is reached service will throw exception to indicate possible dangerous situation.

== Swagger based KIE Server documentation

KIE Server documentation, that is hosted on running KIE Server has been completely rewritten based on Swagger. It provides
nice looking UI plus possibility to try different endpoints directly from within the documentation.

Moreover, it does filter endpoints based on active KIE Server extensions and shows endpoints that are actually available.

It is build as KIE Server extension itself and thus can be disabled if not needed, like production environments.
More on this can be found http://mswiderski.blogspot.com/2017/10/improved-kie-server-documentation.html[here].

== Email work item with template support

Email work item (jar that provides support for emails) has been enhanced with support for html templates based on freemarker template engine.
It is automatically available as soon as the jbpm-work-item-email library is on class path. It supports three system proeprties
that configure it:

- org.jbpm.email.templates.dir - mandatory property that specifies absolute directory path where templates can be found
- org.jbpm.email.templates.watcher.enabled - (default false) optional setting to enable watcher thread for added/changed/deleted template files so they can be seen without server restart
- org.jbpm.email.templates.watcher.interval - (default 5) optional setting for watcher thread that specifies polling interval

Templates are loaded on start up and when discovered any changes to it (in case watcher thread is configured).

To use this feature from Email work item (service node) add extra data input called *Template* that will be the file name of the template (without extension .html).

== Updated jBPM Service Repository

jBPM Service Repository has had a complete overhaul and is now generated from the https://github.com/kiegroup/jbpm-work-items[list of contributed work items].
It now contains an user-friendly "Home Page" that lists all available workitems, specific workitem information, as well direct
download links the workitem resources. Community contributions to the workitem repository are welcome
and contributors names are showcased on the repository home page.

The service repository can also be generated locally by building the https://github.com/kiegroup/jbpm-work-items[jBPM workitems module].
The look/feel of the generated repository can be completely customized by updating the https://github.com/kiegroup/jbpm-work-items/blob/master/repository/src/main/resources/index.html[repository home page].

Need to have and maintain a repository-wide index.conf file has been removed. service repository importer available in https://github.com/kiegroup/jbpm-designer[jbpm-designer]
has also been updated to list all workitems available in the given repository regardless of the existence of this index.conf file.

== Process Designer (Preview)
