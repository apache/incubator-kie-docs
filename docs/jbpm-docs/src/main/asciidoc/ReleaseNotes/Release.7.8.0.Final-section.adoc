= New and Noteworthy in jBPM 7.8.0
:imagesdir: ..

The following features were added to jBPM 7.8

== CMMN 1.1 native execution

jBPM version 7.8 introduces native support for execution of CMMN 1.1 cases. It provides main constructs support and does not aim
at full specification coverage. Constructs that are currently available are:

- tasks (human task, process task, decision task, case task)
- discretionary tasks (same as above)
- stages
- milestones
- case file items
- sentries (both entry and exit)

Not all attributes of tasks are supported - required, repeat and manual activation are currently not supported. Although most of the
behaviour can still be achieved using different constructs.
Sentries for individual tasks are limited to entry criteria while entry and exit are supported for stages and milestones.

Decision task by default maps to DMN decision although ruleflow group based is also possible with simplified syntax -
decisionRef should be set to ruleflow-group attribute.

Event listeners are not supported as they do not bring much value for execution and instead CaseEventListener support in jBPM should
be used as substitute.

jBPM does not provide any modeling capabilities for CMMN and focuses purely on execution of the model.

Even with the support of CMMN jBPM still promotes BPMN2 and the most powerful way of
designing your case definition where you can take advantage of the both specifications.

== Single zip distribution of jBPM

Version 7.8 introduces simplified distribution to let people start very quickly. It is a single zip distribution that requires
just three steps:

<1> download
<2> unzip
<3> run

[source]
----

 curl https://download.jboss.org/jbpm/release/7.8.0.Final/jbpm-server-7.8.0.Final-dist.zip --output jbpm-server-distribuion.zip  <1>

 unzip jbpm-server-distribuion.zip -d jbpm-server <2>

 jbpm-server/bin/standalone.sh <3>
----


that's all that is needed to get fully configured and running jBPM distribution that includes:

- WildFly server
- jBPM console (aka workbench)
- KIE Server
- jBPM case management showcase
- jBPM Service repository

Everything configured to work together smoothly and you can access them at following locations:

- jBPM console - http://localhost:8080/jbpm-console
- KIE Server - http://localhost:8080/kie-server/services/rest/server
- KIE Server Swagger docs - http://localhost:8080/kie-server/docs
- jBPM case management - http://localhost:8080/jbpm-casemgmt
- jBPM Service repository - http://localhost:8080/repository

In addition, this distribution simplifies switching to other databases - MySQL and PostgreSQL. As simple as just running a script
from within jbpm-server/bin directory

[source]
----
./jboss-cli.sh --file=jbpm-mysql-config.cli      (Unix / Linux)

jboss-cli.bat --file=jbpm-mysql-config.cli     (Windows)
----

== Pluggable Startup strategy in KIE Server

KIE server has be equipped with additional pluggable mechanism that allows to control the startup behaviour. Main use case is to allow
finer control over what KIE containers are deployed and in what order. Primary usage pattern is to allow to use monitoring application
(workbench) to manage processes and tasks on immutable KIE Servers. That means they are not under control of the KIE Server Controller
but rather decide themselves what containers should be deployed.

There are two out of the box strategies provided:

- ControllerBasedStartupStrategy - default startup strategy that will favour controller configuration whenever is given and thus override
any local configuration. In case controller endpoint is not present it will fallback to what is known in the local server state file
- LocalContainersStartupStrategy - strategy that will always deploy containers configured in the server state file regardless of
the controller configuration although when controller endpoint is given it will connect to it.

Users can implement they own startup strategies by implementing `org.kie.server.services.api.StartupStrategy` interface and then packaging
it in ServiceLoader way - it needs to have services file that defines the implementation class which is then used upon startup of the
server via discovery mechanism.

To specify which startup strategy should be used a system property `org.kie.server.startup.strategy` should be set
to the name of the class (simple name) implementing given strategy.

Example:
-Dorg.kie.server.startup.strategy=ControllerBasedStartupStrategy

== Custom queries as data set editor in workbench

Custom queries are really powerful features and frequently used. jBPM 7.8 introduces a data set editor to allow use of it
in workbench environment. This editor allows to build data sets that can later on be used to build pages and dashboards based on
actual information retrieved from KIE servers on runtime.

These data sets are scoped to server templates and by that will only target particular subset of KIE Servers. Moreover by using KIE Server
as the source of data, it removes the need to directly access databases which (especially in cloud environments) might not be desired
or even possible. Additionally, these queries are executed in user context (user performing the query is actually user who is logged
into workbench) which makes the results tailored to given user - important from security point of view - will only see data that is
authorised to see.

== Support for FEEL language as expressions for sequence flows

Drools provides support for DMN and FEEL language from the early days of version 7. jBPM added support for decision evaluation
some time ago too. Now it was time to add FEEL language support for sequence flows of the process definition.
Users who work with DMN can unify the language used for expressing condition logic to just single one - FEEL.

== Milestone condition support for multiple instances

Milestone used in specific situation where there are multiple instances of the same milestone node active at the same time
requires additional check upon match. This is to allow extra filtering of matches to find the right instance to be completed.

This advanced use case manifests itself when users model logic for multi instance activation where just simple rule is not enough.
An example of it is to have a stage that includes milestone and each of the stage deals with other types of document to be processed.
Milestone in that stage tracks progress of the document, although it should track individual documents of each stage. So an extra validation
on the milestone is required.
And for that exact scenario a `MatchVariable` was introduced. This is an extra parameter on milestone itself (next to condition) that specifies
name of the variable it should compare with matched items. So if the stage has a variable documentType and then the rule in milestone is as follows:

[source, text]
----
$caseData : CaseData()
$documentType : DocumentType(uploaded == true) from $caseData.getData(docName)
----

user can set `MatchVariable` parameter to `documentType` to compare the activation item (`$documentType`) with `documentType`
variable taken from stage instance and only if this match that milestone instance will be completed.


== Case instance migration

Similar as there is support for process instance migration, version 7.8 introduces case instance migration. This essentially
allows to move given case instance from one definition to another - in other words migrate to another case project version.
This instance migration ensures that all active process instances for given case instance are migrated at the same time, thus
it's required to provide mapping of case definition and process definitions at the time when doing migration.

Same as for process instance migration, there is optional parameter for mapping nodes from old to new version of case or process
definition.

== Even more improvements around service repository and work items

jBPM 7.8 continues with improvements for service repository and work items to make them as simple as possible to be build and used.
It's very powerful feature that is underused usually due to the difficult entry level... but that is now the past. The future looks much
brighter than ever. Have a look at http://mswiderski.blogspot.com/2018/04/jbpm-work-items-are-really-simple.html[this article] to
see how easy it is to build your own service tasks and make use of them in your processes.
