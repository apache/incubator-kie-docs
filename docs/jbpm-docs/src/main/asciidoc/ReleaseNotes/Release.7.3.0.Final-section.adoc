The following features were added to jBPM 7.3


== KIE Server Maven Plugins

With version 7.3 KIE Server has been empowered with additional Maven Plugins that allow to interact with KIE Server and KIE Controller REST api directly from within a build.
This enables easier integration with CI/CD pipelines when building KJars so they can be directly deployed to execution environment (both managed and unmanaged KIE Servers).
