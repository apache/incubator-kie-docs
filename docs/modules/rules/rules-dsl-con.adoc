= Domain Specific Language (DSL)

A Domain Specific Language (DSL) is a rule language defined specifically for your problem domain. You or a business analyst user can then create rules using only the predefined language. This simplifies the process of rule creation for users without deep knowledge of rules and the rule language.

You can define DSL sentences in the Domain Specific Language Definitions Editor in your *Project Explorer*. See the _{DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE}_ for more information about domain specific languages.

The DSL syntax is extended to provide hints to control how the DSL variables are rendered. The following hints are supported:

* `{<varName>:<regular expression>}`
+
This will render a text field in place of the DSL variable when the DSL sentence is used in the guided rule editor.
The content of the text field will be validated against the regular expression.
* `{<varName>:ENUM:<factType.fieldName>}`
+
This will render an enumeration in place of the DSL variable when the DSL sentence is used in the guided rule editor. The `<factType.fieldName>` binds the enumeration to the model fact and field enumeration definition.
This could be either a Knowledge Base enumeration or a Java enumeration, defined in a data model JAR file.
* `{<varName>:DATE:<dateFormat>}`
+
This will render a date selector in place of the DSL variable when the DSL sentence is used in the guided rule editor.
* `{<varName>:BOOLEAN:<[checked | unchecked]>}`
+
This will render a drop-down selector in place of the DSL variable, providing boolean choices, when the DSL sentence is used in the guided rule editor.
