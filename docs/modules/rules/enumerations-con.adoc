= Enumerations

Enumerations are an optional type of asset that you can configure to include additional values in other assets in your project package. For example, configured enumerations can be selected from drop-down lists in a guided decision table in the same package. Double-click a cell to view the enumeration drop-down list if the cell condition is based on the same fact and field as the enumeration.
