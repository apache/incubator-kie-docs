= Types of notifications

The verification and validation feature uses three types of notifications:

* image:gdtValidationVerificationIconError.png[] Error: A serious problem that may lead to the guided decision table failing to work as designed at run time. Conflicts, for example, are reported as errors.
* image:gdtValidationVerificationIconWarning.png[] Warning: Likely a serious problem that may not prevent the guided decision table from working but requires attention. Subsumptions, for example, are reported as warnings.
* image:gdtValidationVerificationIconInfo.png[] Information: A moderate or minor problem that may not prevent the guided decision table from working but requires attention. Missing columns, for example, are reported as information.


[NOTE]
====
{CENTRAL} verification and validation does not prevent you from saving an incorrect change.
The feature only reports issues while editing and you can still continue to overlook those and save your changes.
