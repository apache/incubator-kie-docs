= Using {CENTRAL} to deploy and manage a project

You can use {CENTRAL} to build and deploy a project. If you connect multiple {KIE_SERVERS} to {CENTRAL}, you can use the web UI to deploy and manage project assets on all the servers.

You can group {KIE_SERVERS} into different server configurations. Servers belonging to the same server configuration run the same services, but you can deploy different projects or different versions of projects on different server configurations.

IMPORTANT: You cannot move a {KIE_SERVER} into a different server configuration using {CENTRAL}. You must change the configuration file of the server to change the server configuration name for it.
