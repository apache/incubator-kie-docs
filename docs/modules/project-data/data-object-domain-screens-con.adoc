= Data Object Domain Screens

You can use these domain screen options to add various types of annotations and data object configurations. The domain screen tabs can be selected from the right side of the data object editor screen.

== Drools & jBPM


The *Drools & jBPM* screen allows configuration of Drools-specific attributes.

The Data Modeler in {CENTRAL} supports editing of the pre-defined annotations of fact model classes and attributes.
The following Drools annotations are supported, and can be customized using the *Drools & jBPM* interface:

* [property]``TypeSafe``
* [property]``ClassReactive``
* [property]``PropertyReactive``
* [property]``Role``
* [property]``Timestamp``
* [property]``Duration``
* [property]``Expires``
* [property]``Remotable``

For the fields within the fact model, the [property]``position`` and [property]``Equals`` annotations are supported.
The *Drools & jBPM* screen when a specific field is selected looks as follows:

== Persistence


The *Persistence* screen can be used to configure attributes on basic JPA annotations for persistence.
For fine tuning of annotations, or to add specific annotations, use the *Advanced* screen.


.The Class Persistence View

When a specific field is selected the *Persistence* screen appears as follows:

The following annotations can be managed via the *Persistence* screen.

.Type Annotations
[cols="35%,65%", options="header"]

| Automatically Generated When the Data Object is Persistable

|javax.persistence.Entity
|Yes

|javax.persistence.Table
|No

|javax.persistence.ElementCollection
|Yes - generated by the UI when a new field has one or multiple of a base java type, such as Integer, Boolean, String. This annotation cannot be edited with the *⁠Persistence*
 screen tool (use the *Advanced*
 screen tool instead).
|Created by a field marked as `list`.

All other JPA annotations can be added using the *Advanced*
 screen.

== Advanced

The *Advanced* screen is used for fine-tuning of annotations. Annotations can be configured, added and removed using the Advanced Domain screen.
These can be any annotation that is on the classpath.

.Advanced Annotations Option

When you add a new annotation, the required parameters are determined.

.Annotation Parameters

== OptaPlanner

Beginning with version 7.0, {CENTRAL} enables you to leverage planner-specific functionality, such as configuring a Data Object as a planning entity, or a planning solution. See the {URL_PLANNER_GUIDE}[{PLANNER}] guide for further information about Data Modeler planning capabilities.
