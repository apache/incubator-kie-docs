= Defining Advanced Field Data

After you have defined a *GIVEN* input fact, you can further define it by adding a literal value, bound variable, or a new fact.

.Prerequisite
* A *GIVEN* fact has been added to the test scenario. See <<test-scenarios-create-proc>> for details.

.Procedure
. Within the *GIVEN* fact, click *Add a field* and add a property for your object.
. Click image:6191.png[] next to the added property.
. Select one of the following types of field values:
+
--
* *Literal value:* Creates an open field in which you enter a specific literal value.
* *Bound variable* Sets the value of the field to the fact bound to a selected variable. The field type must match the bound variable type.
* *Create new fact* Enables you to create a new fact and assign it as a field value of the parent fact. Click on the fact to be assigned as a field value to be supplied with a drop down of various field values. These values may be given further field values.
