= Adding globals in test scenarios

Globals are named objects that are visible to the rule engine but are different from the objects for facts. Accordingly, the changes in the object of a global do not trigger the re-evaluation of rules. You can use and validate global fields in a test scenario.

.Procedure
. Go to *Menu* -> *Design* -> *Projects* and click the project name.
. Click *Add Asset* -> *Global Variable(s)* to create a global definition.
. Define your global variable name and type.
. Go to your test scenario, click *Data Objects* -> *New item* to import the object type for your global in your test. If you do not import the type of your global variable, the variable will not be accessible for your test.
. In the *Model* tab, click image:6176.png[] next to the *(globals)* label, select the global, and click *Add*.
