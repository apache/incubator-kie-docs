[[_wb.installation]]
= Installation

[[_wb.warinstallation]]
== War installation


Use the `war` from the workbench distribution zip that corresponds to your application server.
The differences between these `war` files are mainly superficial.
For example, some JARs might be excluded if the application server already supplies them.

* ``eap7``: tailored for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7
* ``tomcat8``: tailored for Apache Tomcat 8
+

[NOTE]
====
Apache Tomcat requires additional configuration to correctly install the Workbench.
Please consult the `README.md` in the `war` for the most up to date procedure.
====
* ``wildfly11``: tailored for Wildfly 11


[[_wb.workbenchdata]]
== Workbench data


The workbench stores its data, by default in the directory ``$WORKING_DIRECTORY/.niogit``, for example ``wildfly-11.0.0.Final/bin/.niogit``, but it can be overridden with the <<_wb.systemproperties,system property>>``-Dorg.uberfire.nio.git.dir``.

[NOTE]
====
In production, make sure to back up the workbench data directory.
====

[[_wb.systemproperties]]
== System properties


Here's a list of all system properties:

* **``org.appformer.m2repo.url``**: Location of the for the default Maven repository the workbench uses when looking for dependencies. Usually this points to the Maven repository inside the Workbench for example ``http://localhost:8080/kie-wb/maven2``. Please set this before starting up the Workbench. Default: File path to the inner m2 repository.

* **``org.kie.verification.disable-dtable-realtime-verification``**: Disables the realtime validation and verification of decision tables. Default: `false`
* **``org.kie.workbench.controller``**: URL for connecting with a Kie Server Controller, for example: `ws://localhost:8080/kie-server-controller/websocket/controller`.
[NOTE]
====
Only Web Socket protocol is supported for connecting with a remote Kie Server Controller.
When specifying this proporty, the Workbench will automatically disable all the features related to running the embbeded controller.
====

[NOTE]
====
Please refer to <<usingTokenBasedAuthentication, Using token based authentication>> for more details about how to use token based authentication.
====
* **``kie.keystore.keyStoreURL``**: URL to a keystore which should be used for connecting with a remote Kie Server Controller.
* **``kie.keystore.keyStorePwd``**: Password to a keystore.
* **``kie.keystore.key.ctrl.alias``**: Alias of the key where password is stored.
* **``kie.keystore.key.ctrl.pwd``**: Password of an alias with stored password.

To change one of these system properties in a WildFly or JBoss EAP cluster:

. Edit the file ``$JBOSS_HOME/domain/configuration/host.xml``.
. Locate the XML elements `server` that belong to the `main-server-group` and add a system property, for example:
+

[source,xml]
----
<system-properties>
  <property name="org.uberfire.nio.git.dir" value="..." boot-time="false"/>
  ...
</system-properties>

== Trouble shooting

[[_wb.troubleshootingloadingspinner]]
=== Loading.. does not disappear and Workbench fails to show


There have been reports that Firewalls in between the server and the browser can interfere with Server Sent Events (SSE) used by the Workbench.

The issue results in the "Loading..." spinner remaining visible and the Workbench failing to materialize.

The workaround is to disable the Workbench's use of Server Sent Events by adding file `/WEB-INF/classes/ErraiService.properties` to the exploded WAR containing the value ``errai.bus.enable_sse_support=false``.
Re-package the WAR and re-deploy.

Some Users have also reported disabling Server Sent Events does not resolve the issue. The solution found to work is to configure the JVM to use a different Entropy Gathering Device on Linux for `SecureRandom`. This can be configured by setting System Property `java.security.egd` to `file:/dev/./urandom`. See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33166198/kie-workbench-not-loading-after-login/39110177#39110177[this]  Stack Overflow post for details.

Please note however this affects the JVM's random  number generation and may present other challenges where strong cryptography is required. Configure with caution.

=== Not able to clone KIE Workbench Git repository using ssh protocol.
Git clients using ssh to interact with the Git server that is bundled with Workbench are authenticated and authorized to perform git commands by the security API that is part of the Uberfire backend server.  When using an LDAP security realm, some git clients were not being authorized as expected.  This was due to the fact that for non-web clients such as Git via ssh, the principal (i.e., user or group) name assigned to a user by the application server's user registry is the more complex DN associated to that principal by LDAP. The logic of the Uberfire backend server looked for on exact match of roles allowed with the principal name returned and therefore failed.

It is now possible to control the role-principal matching via the system property

[source, property]
----
org.uberfire.ldap.regex.role_mapper
----

which takes as its value a Regex pattern to be applied when matching LDAP principal to role names.  The pattern must contain the literal word variable 'role'.  During authorization the variable is replaced by each of the allow application roles.  If the pattern is matched the role is added to the user.

For instance, if the DN for the admin group in LDAP is

[source, property]
----
DN: cn=admin,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com
----

and its intended role is admin, then setting `org.uberfire.ldap.regex.role_mapper` with value

[source, regex]
----
cn[\\ ]*=[\\ ]*role
----

will find a match on role 'admin'.
