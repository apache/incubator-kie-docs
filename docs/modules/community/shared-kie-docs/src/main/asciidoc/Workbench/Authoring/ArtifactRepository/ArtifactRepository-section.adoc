= Artifact Repository


Projects often need external artifacts in their classpath in order to build, for example a domain model JARs.
The artifact repository holds those artifacts.

The Artifact Repository is a full blown Maven repository.
It follows the semantics of a Maven remote repository: all snapshots are timestamped.
But it is often stored on the local hard drive.

By default the artifact repository is stored under ``$WORKING_DIRECTORY/repositories/kie``, but it can be overridden with the <<_wb.systemproperties,system property>>``-Dorg.guvnor.m2repo.dir``.
There is only 1 Maven repository per installation.

The Artifact Repository screen shows a list of the artifacts in the Maven repository:

To add a new artifact to that Maven repository, either:

* Use the upload button and select a JAR. If the JAR contains a POM file under `META-INF/maven` (which every JAR build by Maven has), no further information is needed. Otherwise, a groupId, artifactId and version need be given too.

* Using Maven, `mvn deploy` to that Maven repository. Refresh the list to make it show up.


[NOTE]
====
This remote Maven repository is relatively simple.
It does not support proxying, mirroring, ... like Nexus or Archiva.
