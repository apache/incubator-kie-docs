[[_wb.datasources]]
= Data Source Management

The data source management system provides the ability of defining data sources for accessing external databases.
This data sources can be later used by other workbench components like the Data Sets.

[[_wb.databasedrivers]]
== Database Drivers

To be able to communicate with the target database a data source will need a database driver to access it.
This is why the system additionally provides the ability of defining database drivers for the data sources operation.
A database driver is basically a JDBC compliant driver. We will see them in the next topics.

[[_wb.datasourceauthoringperspective]]
== Data Source Authoring Page

Everything related to the authoring of data sources and drivers can be found under the _Data Source Authoring_ page accessible from the following top level menu entry: __Extensions>Data Sources__, as shown in the following screenshot.

.Data Source Authoring Page

[NOTE]
====
This page is only intended for Administrator users, since defining data sources can be considered a low level task.
====

[[_wb.datasourceexplorer]]
== Data Source Explorer

The _Data Source Explorer_ lists the data sources and drivers currently defined in the system, at the same time it provides the required actions for managing them.

.Data Source Explorer

* (1) Action link for creating a new data source
* (2) List of currently available data sources
* (3) Action link for creating a new driver
* (4) List of currently available drivers

[[_wb.datasourcecreation]]
== New Data Source Wizard

Clicking on the _New Data Source_ action link opens the New Data Source Wizard:

.New Data Source Wizard
image::Workbench/Authoring/DataSourceManagement/NewDataSourceWizard.png[align="center"]

The following required parameters define a data source:

* Name: A unique name for the data source definition.

* Connection URL: A JDBC database connection url compliant with the selected driver type.
This is an example of a connection url for a PostgreSQL database: _jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/appformer_.

* User: A user name in the target database.

* Password: The corresponding user password.

* Driver: Selects the JDBC driver to be used for connecting to the target database. _Note that the connection url format may vary depending on the driver, and different database vendors typically provides different drivers._

* Test connection: Once clicked, the system will show a dialog similar to the one below showing the connection test status.

.Test Connection Status

[NOTE]
====
While not required, it's recommended to use the test connection button to check the correctness of the data source parameters prior to finishing the data source creation.
====

[[_wb.datasourceeditor]]
== Data Source Editor

The _Data Source Editor_ is opened by clicking on a data source item in the _Data Source Explorer_.

The following screenshot shows the _Data Source Editor_ opened for the data source of the example above.

.Data Source Editor
image::Workbench/Authoring/DataSourceManagement/DataSourceEditor.png[align="center"]

* Main Panel: The main panel basically lets you modify the data source configuration parameters.

* Test connection: Tests the connection.

[NOTE]
====
It's a recommended practice to test the connection prior saving a modified data source.
====

[[_wb.datasourcecontent]]
== Data Source Content Browser

The data source content browser is opened by clicking on the _Browse Content_ button, and enables the navigation through the database structure pointed by the data source.
The navigation is performed in three levels, _Schemas level_, _Current schema level_ and _Current table level_.

* Schemas level: lists all the database schemas accessible by current data source.
Which schemas are listed depends on the database access rights granted to the user which was used in the connection configuration.
Similarly for the following item.

* Current schema level: shows all the database tables for the selected schema.

* Current table level: shows the table content for the selected table.

The following screenshots show the information shown at each level, for a user that realized the following navigation steps.
Selects the _"public"_ schema -> Selects the _"country"_ table.

_Schema Selection_:

Clicking on the _Open_ button opens the _Current schema level_ for the selected schema.

.Database schemas

_Table Selection_:

Clicking on the _Open_ button opens the _Current table level_ for the selected table.

.Schema tables

_Table information_:

The rows for the selected table are shown at this level.

.Table rows

[[_wb.externaldatasources]]
== External Data Sources

External data sources are typically not defined in current workbench, instead they exist in current container and for some containers like Wildfly 11 or the JBoss EAP 7 servers they can still be listed in read only mode.
In this cases only the _Data Source Content Browser_ is enabled.

[[_wb.drivercreation]]
== New Driver Wizard

Clicking on the _New Driver_ action link opens the New Driver Wizard:

.New Driver Wizard
image::Workbench/Authoring/DataSourceManagement/NewDriverWizard.png[align="center"]

The following required parameters define a Driver:

* Name: A unique name for the driver definition.

* Driver Class Name: The java fully qualified name for the class that implements the JDBC driver contract.

* Group Id: The maven group id for the artifact that contains the JDBC driver implementation.

* Artifact Id: The maven artifact id for the artifact that contains the JDBC driver implementation.

* Version: The maven version for the artifact that contains the JDBC driver implementation.

[NOTE]
====
Some commercial database drivers (like Oracle) are not available in the maven central repository.
You can use those by first uploading them via _Artifact Repository_ page and then continue with the driver configuration as for the drivers available in the maven central repository.
====

[[_wb.drivereditor]]
== Driver Editor

The _Driver Editor_ is opened by clicking on a driver item in the _Data Source Explorer_.

The following screenshot shows the _Driver Editor_ opened for the driver of the example above.

.Driver Editor
image::Workbench/Authoring/DataSourceManagement/DriverEditor.png[align="center"]

* Main Panel: The main panel basically lets you modify the driver configuration parameters.
See _New Driver Wizard_.

[[_wb.bydefaultdrivers]]
== By Default Drivers

The system is shipped with a set of by default configured drivers for the most common used open source databases.
And they are aligned with the latest database versions supported by the Wildfly 11 and the JBoss EAP 7 servers.

.By Default Drivers
image::Workbench/Authoring/DataSourceManagement/DefaultDrivers.png[align="center"]

[NOTE]
====
The by default drivers initialization can be disabled by setting the datasource.management.disableDefaultDrivers configuration property to true.
It can be set by configuring the proper value in the datasource-management.properties file, or by passing the system property  -Ddatasource.management.disableDefaultDrivers=true to the JVM.
For more information see Advanced Settings.
====

[[_wb.advancedsettings]]
== Advanced Settings

The data source management system advanced settings can be found in the datasource-management.properties file in the WEB-INF/classes
directory of the given Workbench distribution file.

The data source management system has the ability of working with two different internal implementations for the data
sources and drivers. An implementation based on the Wildfly/EAP native data sources and drivers, and a container
independent implementation.
Wildfly/EAP Workbench distributions are configured by default for using the native Wildlfy/EAP
containers implementations, and Tomcat8 distributions are configured for using the container independent implementations.
This latter implementation can also be used for Wildfly/EAP containers.

The valid combinations are:

WildflyDataSourceProvider + WildflyDriverProvider +
or +
DBCPDataSourceProvider + DBCPDriverProvider

The datasource.management.wildfly.xxxxx  properties are only suited for the WildflyXXXProviders.

[NOTE]
====
The properties above can also be set by passing system properties to the JVM using the Java standard mechanism. e.g. -Ddatasource.management.wildfly.port=1234.
