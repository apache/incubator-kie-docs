= First steps to create a data model


By default, a data model is always constrained to the context of a project.
For the purpose of this tutorial, we will assume that a correctly configured project already exists and the authoring page is open.

To start the creation of a data model inside a project, take the following steps: 

. From the home panel, select the Desing page and select the given project.

.Go to authoring page and select a project

+
. Open the Data Modeller tool by clicking on a Data Object file, or using the "Create New Asset -> Data Object" menu option. Set Data Object name to "PurchaseOrder" and click Ok.
+

This will start up the Data Modeller tool, which has the following general aspect:

The "Editor" tab is divided into the following sections:

* The new field section is dedicated to the creation of new fields, and is opened when the "add field" button is pressed.

* The Data Object's "field browser" section displays a list with the data object fields.

+
* The "Data Object / Field general properties" section. This is the rightmost section of the Data Modeller editor and visualizes the "Data Object" or "Field" general properties, depending on user selection. 
+ 
Data Object general properties can be selected by clicking on the Data Object Selector.

* On workbench's right side a new "Tool Bar" is provided that enables the selection of different context sensitive tool windows that will let the user do domain specific configurations. Currently four tool windows are provided for the following domains "Drools & jBPM", "OptaPlanner", "Persistence" and "Advanced" configurations.

The "Source" tab shows an editor that allows the visualization and modification of the generated java code. 

* Round trip between the "Editor" and "Source" tabs is possible, and also source code preservation is provided. It means that not matter where the Java code was generated (e.g. Eclipse, Data modeller), the data modeller will only update the necessary code blocks to maintain the model updated.

The "Overview" tab shows the standard metadata and version information as the other workbench editors.
