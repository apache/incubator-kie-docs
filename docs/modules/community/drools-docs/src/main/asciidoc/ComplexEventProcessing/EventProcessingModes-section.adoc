= Event Processing Modes
:imagesdir: ..


Rules engines in general have a well known way of processing data and rules and provide the application with the results.
Also, there is not many requirements on how facts should be presented to the rules engine, specially because in general, the processing itself is time independent.
That is a good assumption for most scenarios, but not for all of them.
When the requirements include the processing of real time or near real time events, time becomes and important variable of the reasoning process.

The following sections will explain the impact of time on rules reasoning and the two modes provided by Drools for the reasoning process.
