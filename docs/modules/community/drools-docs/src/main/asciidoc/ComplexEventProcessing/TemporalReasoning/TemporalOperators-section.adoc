= Temporal Operators
:imagesdir: ../..


Drools implements all 13 operators defined by Allen and also their logical complement (negation). This section details each of the operators and their parameters.

== After


The after evaluator correlates two events and matches when the temporal distance from the current event to the event being correlated belongs to the distance range declared for the operator.

Lets look at an example:

[source]
----
$eventA : EventA( this after[ 3m30s, 4m ] $eventB )
----


The previous pattern will match if and only if the temporal distance between the time when $eventB finished and the time when $eventA started is between ( 3 minutes and 30 seconds ) and ( 4 minutes ). In other words:

[source]
----
 3m30s <= $eventA.startTimestamp - $eventB.endTimeStamp <= 4m
----


The temporal distance interval for the after operator is optional:

* If two values are defined (like in the example below), the interval starts on the first value and finishes on the second.
* If only one value is defined, the interval starts on the value and finishes on the positive infinity.
* If no value is defined, it is assumed that the initial value is 1ms and the final value is the positive infinity.


[NOTE]
====
It is possible to define negative distances for this operator.
Example:

[source]
----
$eventA : EventA( this after[ -3m30s, -2m ] $eventB )
----
====

[NOTE]
====
If the first value is greater than the second value, the engine automatically reverses them, as there is no reason to have the first value greater than the second value.
Example: the following two patterns are considered to have the same semantics:

[source]
----
$eventA : EventA( this after[ -3m30s, -2m ] $eventB ) 
$eventA : EventA( this after[ -2m, -3m30s ] $eventB )
----
====

[NOTE]
====
The __after__, _before_ and _coincides_ operators can be used to define constraints between events, java.util.Date attributes, and long attributes (interpreted as timestamps since epoch) in any combination.
Example:

[source]
----
EventA( this after $someDate )
----
====

== Before


The before evaluator correlates two events and matches when the temporal distance from the event being correlated to the current correlated belongs to the distance range declared for the operator.

Lets look at an example:

[source]
----
$eventA : EventA( this before[ 3m30s, 4m ] $eventB )
----


The previous pattern will match if and only if the temporal distance between the time when $eventA finished and the time when $eventB started is between ( 3 minutes and 30 seconds ) and ( 4 minutes ). In other words:

[source]
----
 3m30s <= $eventB.startTimestamp - $eventA.endTimeStamp <= 4m
----


The temporal distance interval for the before operator is optional:

* If two values are defined (like in the example below), the interval starts on the first value and finishes on the second.
* If only one value is defined, then the interval starts on the value and finishes on the positive infinity.
* If no value is defined, it is assumed that the initial value is 1ms and the final value is the positive infinity.


[NOTE]
====
It is possible to define negative distances for this operator.
Example:

[source]
----
$eventA : EventA( this before[ -3m30s, -2m ] $eventB )
----
====

[NOTE]
====
If the first value is greater than the second value, the engine automatically reverses them, as there is no reason to have the first value greater than the second value.
Example: the following two patterns are considered to have the same semantics:

[source]
----
$eventA : EventA( this before[ -3m30s, -2m ] $eventB ) 
$eventA : EventA( this before[ -2m, -3m30s ] $eventB )
----
====

[NOTE]
====
The __after__, _before_ and _coincides_ operators can be used to define constraints between events, java.util.Date attributes, and long attributes (interpreted as timestamps since epoch) in any combination.
Example:

[source]
----
EventA( this after $someDate )
----
====

== Coincides


The coincides evaluator correlates two events and matches when both happen at the same time.
Optionally, the evaluator accept thresholds for the distance between events' start and finish timestamps.

Lets look at an example:

[source]
----
$eventA : EventA( this coincides $eventB )
----


The previous pattern will match if and only if the start timestamps of both $eventA and $eventB are the same AND the end timestamp of both $eventA and $eventB also are the same.

Optionally, this operator accepts one or two parameters.
These parameters are the thresholds for the distance between matching timestamps.

* If only one parameter is given, it is used for both start and end timestamps.
* If two parameters are given, then the first is used as a threshold for the start timestamp and the second one is used as a threshold for the end timestamp.


In other words:

[source]
----
$eventA : EventA( this coincides[15s, 10s] $eventB )
----


Above pattern will match if and only if:

[source]
----
abs( $eventA.startTimestamp - $eventB.startTimestamp ) <= 15s && 
abs( $eventA.endTimestamp - $eventB.endTimestamp ) <= 10s
----

[WARNING]
====
It makes no sense to use negative interval values for the parameters and the engine will raise an error if that happens.

Example:

[source]
----
EventA( this after $someDate )
----
====

== During


The during evaluator correlates two events and matches when the current event happens during the occurrence of the event being correlated.

Lets look at an example:

[source]
----
$eventA : EventA( this during $eventB )
----


The previous pattern will match if and only if the $eventA starts after $eventB starts and finishes before $eventB finishes.

In other words:

[source]
----
$eventB.startTimestamp < $eventA.startTimestamp <= $eventA.endTimestamp < $eventB.endTimestamp
----


The during operator accepts 1, 2 or 4 optional parameters as follow:

* If one value is defined, this will be the maximum distance between the start timestamp of both event and the maximum distance between the end timestamp of both events in order to operator match. Example:
+

[source]
----
$eventA : EventA( this during[ 5s ] $eventB )
----
+
Will match if and only if:
+

[source]
----
0 < $eventA.startTimestamp - $eventB.startTimestamp <= 5s && 
0 < $eventB.endTimestamp - $eventA.endTimestamp <= 5s
----


* If two values are defined, the first value will be the minimum distance between the timestamps of both events, while the second value will be the maximum distance between the timestamps of both events. Example:
+

[source]
----
$eventA : EventA( this during[ 5s, 10s ] $eventB )
----
+
Will match if and only if:
+

[source]
----
5s <= $eventA.startTimestamp - $eventB.startTimestamp <= 10s && 
5s <= $eventB.endTimestamp - $eventA.endTimestamp <= 10s
----


* If four values are defined, the first two values will be the minimum and maximum distances between the start timestamp of both events, while the last two values will be the minimum and maximum distances between the end timestamp of both events. Example:
+

[source]
----
$eventA : EventA( this during[ 2s, 6s, 4s, 10s ] $eventB )
----
+
Will match if and only if:
+

[source]
----
2s <= $eventA.startTimestamp - $eventB.startTimestamp <= 6s && 
4s <= $eventB.endTimestamp - $eventA.endTimestamp <= 10s
----


== Finishes


The finishes evaluator correlates two events and matches when the current event's start timestamp happens after the correlated event's start timestamp, but both end timestamps occur at the same time.

Lets look at an example:

[source]
----
$eventA : EventA( this finishes $eventB )
----


The previous pattern will match if and only if the $eventA starts after $eventB starts and finishes at the same time $eventB finishes.

In other words:

[source]
----
$eventB.startTimestamp < $eventA.startTimestamp && 
$eventA.endTimestamp == $eventB.endTimestamp
----


The finishes evaluator accepts one optional parameter.
If it is defined, it determines the maximum distance between the end timestamp of both events in order for the operator to match.
Example:

[source]
----
$eventA : EventA( this finishes[ 5s ] $eventB )
----


Will match if and only if:

[source]
----
$eventB.startTimestamp < $eventA.startTimestamp && 
abs( $eventA.endTimestamp - $eventB.endTimestamp ) <= 5s
----

[WARNING]
====
It makes no sense to use a negative interval value for the parameter and the engine will raise an exception if that happens.
====

== Finished By


The finishedby evaluator correlates two events and matches when the current event start timestamp happens before the correlated event start timestamp, but both end timestamps occur at the same time.
This is the symmetrical opposite of finishes evaluator.

Lets look at an example:

[source]
----
$eventA : EventA( this finishedby $eventB )
----


The previous pattern will match if and only if the $eventA starts before $eventB starts and finishes at the same time $eventB finishes.

In other words:

[source]
----
$eventA.startTimestamp < $eventB.startTimestamp && 
$eventA.endTimestamp == $eventB.endTimestamp
----


The finishedby evaluator accepts one optional parameter.
If it is defined, it determines the maximum distance between the end timestamp of both events in order for the operator to match.

----


Will match if and only if:

[source]
----
$eventA.startTimestamp < $eventB.startTimestamp &&

----
$eventA.startTimestamp < $eventB.startTimestamp <= $eventB.endTimestamp < $eventA.endTimestamp
----

----
$eventA : EventA( this includes[ 5s ] $eventB )
----

----
0 < $eventB.startTimestamp - $eventA.startTimestamp <= 5s && 
0 < $eventA.endTimestamp - $eventB.endTimestamp <= 5s
----


* If two values are defined, the first value will be the minimum distance between the timestamps of both events, while the second value will be the maximum distance between the timestamps of both events. Example:

$eventA : EventA( this includes[ 5s, 10s ] $eventB )
----
+
Will match if and only if:

5s <= $eventA.endTimestamp - $eventB.endTimestamp <= 10s
----


* If four values are defined, the first two values will be the minimum and maximum distances between the start timestamp of both events, while the last two values will be the minimum and maximum distances between the end timestamp of both events. Example:

[source]
----
abs( $eventB.startTimestamp - $eventA.endTimestamp ) == 0
----


The meets evaluator accepts one optional parameter.
If it is defined, it determines the maximum distance between the end timestamp of current event and the start timestamp of the correlated event in order for the operator to match.
