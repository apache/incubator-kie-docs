Guided Rules are authored with a UI to control and prompt user input based on knowledge of the object model.

This can also be augmented with DSL sentences.

== Parts of the Guided Rule Editor


The Guided Rule Editor is composed of three main sections.

The following diagram shows the editor in action.
The following descriptions apply to the lettered boxes in the diagram:

.The guided BRL editor
image::Workbench/AuthoringAssets/GuidedEditor-overview.png[align="center"]


A : The different parts of a rule:

* The "WHEN" part, or conditions, of the rule.
* The "THEN" action part of the rule.
* Optional attributes that may effect the operation of the rule.


[[_drools.guidedruleeditorlhs]]
== The "WHEN" (left-hand side) of a Rule


B : This shows a pattern which is declaring that the rule is looking for a "LoanApplication" fact (the fields are listed below, in this case none). Another pattern, "Applicant", is listed below "LoanApplication". Fields "creditRating" and "applicationDate" are listed.
Clicking on the fact name ("LoanApplication") will pop-up a list of options to add to the fact declaration:

* Add more fields (e.g. their "location").
* Assign a variable name to the fact (which you can use later on if needs be)
* Add "multiple field" constraints - i.e. constraints that span across fields (e.g. age > 42 or risk > 2).

C : The "minus" icon ("[-]") indicates you can remove something.
In this case it would remove the whole "LoanApplication" fact declaration.
Depending upon the placement of the icon different components of the rule declaration can be removed, for example a Fact Pattern, Field Constraint, other Conditional Element ("exists", "not exists", "from" etc) or an Action.

D : The "plus" icon ("+") allows you to add more patterns to the condition or the action part of the rule, or more attributes.
In all cases, a popup option box is provided.
For the "WHEN" part of the rule, you can choose from a list of Conditional Elements to add: 

* A Constraint on a Fact: it will give you a list of facts.
* "The following does not exist": the fact plus constraints must not exist.
* "The following exists": at least one match should exist (but there only needs to be one - it will not trigger for each match).
* "Any of the following are true": any of the patterns can match (you then add patterns to these higher level patterns).
* "From": this will insert a new From Conditional Element to the rule.
* "From Accumulate": this will insert a new Accumulate Conditional Element to the rule.
* "From Collect": this will insert a new Collect Conditional Element to the rule.
* "From Entry-point": this allows you to define an Entry Point for the pattern.
* "Free Form DRL": this will let you insert a free chunk of DRL.

If you just put a fact (like is shown above) then all the patterns are combined together so they are all true ("and").

E : This shows the constraint for the "creditRating" field.
Looking from left to right you find:

* The field name: "creditRating". Clicking on it you can assign a variable name to it, or access nested properties of it.
* A list of constraint operations ("equal to" being selected): The content of this list changes depending on the field's data type.
* The value field: It could be one of the following:
** A literal value: depending on the field's data type different components will be displayed:
*** String -> Textbox
*** Any numerical value -> Textbox restricting entry to values valid for the numerical sub-type (e.g. a byte can hold values from -128 to 127). BigDecimal and BigInteger data-types are also supported. Please ensure the appropriate Class has been imported in the Package configuration. The import will be added automatically if a POJO model has been uploaded that exposes an accessor or mutator for a BigDecimal or BigInteger field. BigDecimal values are automatically suffixed with "B" indicating to the underlying Engine that the literal value should be interpreted as a BigDecimal. BigIntegers are suffixed with "I". The user does not need to enter the suffix.
*** Date -> Calendar
*** Enumeration -> Listbox
*** Boolean -> Checkbox
** A "formula": this is an expression which is calculated (this is for advanced users only)
** An Expression - this will let you use an Expression Builder to build up a full mvel expression. (At the moment only basic expressions are supported)

F : This shows the constraint for the "applicationDate" field.
Looking from left to right you find: 

* The field name: "applicationDate".
* A list of constraint operations: "after" being selected.
* A "clock" icon. Since the "applicationDate" is a Date data-type the list of available operators includes those relating to Complex Event Processing (CEP). When a CEP operator is used this additional icon is displayed to allow you to enter additional CEP operator parameters. Clicking the "clock" will cycle the available combinations of CEP operator parameters.


[NOTE]
====
Complex Event Processing operators are also available when the Fact has been declared as an event.
Refer to the "Fact Model" chapter of this user-guide for details on how to add annotations to your Fact model.
Events have access to the full range of CEP operators; Date field-types are restricted to "after", "before" and "coincides".
====

[NOTE]
====
Facts annotated as Events can also have CEP sliding windows defined.

[[_drools.guidedruleeditoraddingpatterns]]
=== Adding Patterns


When clicking on the + button of the WHEN section, a new popup will appear letting you to add a new Pattern to the Rule.
The popup will looks similar to the image below.
In this popup you could select the type of Pattern to add by selecting one of the list items.
In the list you will have an entry for each defined Fact Type, in addition to the already mentioned Conditional Elements like "exists", "doesn't exist", "from", "collect", "accumulate", "from entry-point" and "free form DRL". Once you have selected one of this elements, you can add a new Pattern by clicking on the "Ok" button.
The new pattern will be added at the bottom of the rule's left hand side.
If you want to choose a different position, you can use the combobox placed at the top of the popup.

You can also open this popup by clicking in the [+] button from a Pattern's action toolbar.
If that is the case, the pop-up that appears wouldn't constraint the position combobox, because the new Pattern will be added just after the Pattern where you clicked.

[[_drools.guidedruleeditoraddingconstraints]]
=== Adding constraints


The below dialog is what you will get when you want to add constraints to a fact.
In the top half are the simple options: you can either add a field constraint straight away (a list of fields of the applicable fact will be shown), or you can add a "Multiple field constraint" using AND or OR operands.
In the bottom half of the window you have the Advanced options: you can add a formula (which resolves to True or False - this is like in the example above: "... salary > (2500 * 4.1)". You can also assign a Variable name to the fact (which means you can then access that variable on the action part of the rule, to set a value etc).

[[_drools.guidedruleeditorrhs]]
== The "THEN" (right-hand side) of a Rule


H : This shows an "action" of the rule, the Right Hand Side of a rule consists in a list of actions.
In this case, we are updating the "explanation" field of the "LoanApplication" fact.
There are quite a few other types of actions you can use:

* Insert a completely new Fact and optionally set a field on the Fact.
+ 
The value field can be one of the following:

** A literal value: depending on the field's data type different components will be displayed:
*** String -> Textbox
*** Any numerical value -> Textbox restricting entry to values valid for the numerical sub-type (e.g. a byte can hold values from -128 to 127). BigDecimal and BigInteger data-types are also supported. Please ensure the appropriate Class has been imported in the Package configuration. The import will be added automatically if a POJO model has been uploaded that exposes an accessor or mutator for a BigDecimal or BigInteger field. BigDecimal values are automatically suffixed with "B" indicating to the underlying Engine that the literal value should be interpreted as a BigDecimal. BigIntegers are suffixed with "I". The user does not need to enter the suffix.
*** Date -> Calendar
*** Enumeration -> Listbox
*** Boolean -> Checkbox
** A variable bound to a Fact or Field in the left-hand side. The data-type of the field being set must match the data-type of the variable.
** A "formula": this is an expression which is calculated (this is for advanced users only)
* Logically insert a completely new Fact (see "Truth Maintenance" in the Expert documentation) and optionally set a field on the Fact.

[[_drools.guidedruleeditoroptionalattributes]]
== Optional attributes


The attributes section of a rule provides the means to define metadata and attributes (such as "salience", "no-loop" etc).

Click on the "+" icon to add a new metadata or attribute definition.
Each defined will appear listed in this section.

Click on the "-" icon beside each metadata or attribute to remove it.

[[_drools.guidedruleeditoroptionalattributessalience]]
=== Salience


Each rule has a salience value which is an integer value that defaults to zero.
The salience value  represents the priority of the rule with higher salience values representing higher priority.
Salience  values can be positive or negative. 

[[_drools.guidedruleeditortoolbar]]
== Pattern/Action toolbar


G : Next to each Pattern or Action you will find a toolbar containing 3 buttons.

The first "$$+$$" icon lets you insert a new Pattern/Action at an arbitrary location.
The other "$$+$$" icons allow you to insert a new Pattern/Action below that you have selected.

The remaining arrow icons allow you to move the current Pattern/Action up or down.

[[_drools.guidedruleeditorenumerations]]
== User driven drop down lists

.Data enumeration showing as a drop down list
image::Workbench/AuthoringAssets/EnumDropDown.png[align="center"]


Note that is it possible to limit field values to items in a pre-configured list.
This list is either defined by a Java enumeration or configured as part of the package (using a data enumeration to provide values for the drop down list). These values can be a fixed list, or (for example) loaded from a database.
This is useful for codes, and other fields where there are set values.
It is also possible to have what is displayed on screen, in a drop down, be different to the value (or code) used in a rule.
See the section on data enumerations for how these are configured.

It is possible to define a list of values for one field that are dependent upon the value of one or more other fields, on the same Fact (e.g.
a list of "Cities" depending on the selected "Country region"). Please refer to the section on "Enumerations" for more information.

[[_drools.guidedruleeditordsl]]
== Augmenting with DSL sentences


If the package the rule is part of has a DSL configuration, when when you add conditions or actions, then it will provide a list of "DSL Sentences" which you can choose from - when you choose one, it will add a row to the rule - where the DSL specifies values come from a user, then a edit box (text) will be shown (so it ends up looking a bit like a form). This is optional, and there is another DSL editor.
Please note that the DSL capabilities in this editor are slightly less then the full set of DSL features (basically you can do [when] and [then] sections of the DSL only - which is no different to drools 3 in effect).

The following diagram shows the DSL sentences in action in the guided editor:

.DSL in guided editor

[[_drools.guidedruleeditorcomplexexample]]
== A more complex example:

.A more complex BRL example
image::Workbench/AuthoringAssets/GuidedComplex.png[align="center"]


In the above example, you can see how to use a mixture of Conditional Elements, literal values, and formulas.
The rule has 4 "top level" Patterns and 1 Action.
The "top level" Patterns are:

. A Fact Pattern on Person. This Pattern contains two field constraints: one for birthDate field and the other one is a formula. Note that the value of the birthDate restriction is selected from a calendar. Another thing to note is that you can make calculations and use nested fields in the formula restriction (i.e. car.brand). Finally, we are setting a variable name ($p) to the Person Fact Type. You can then use this variable in other Patterns.
+

[NOTE]
====
The generated DRL from this Pattern will be:

[source]
----
$p : Person( birthDate < "19-Dec-1982" , eval( car.brand == "Ford" && salary > (2500 * 4.1) ))
----
====
. A From Pattern. This condition will create a match for every Address whose street name is "Elm St." from the Person's list of addresses. The left side of the from is a regular Fact Pattern and the right side is an Expression Builder that let us inspect variable's fields.
+

[NOTE]
====
The generated DRL from this Pattern will be: `Address( street == "Elm St." ) from
          $p.addresses`
====
. A "Not Exist" Conditional Element. This condition will match when its content doesn't create a match. In this case, its content is a regular Fact Pattern (on Person). In this Fact Pattern you can see how variables ($p) could be used inside a formula value.
+

[NOTE]
====
The generated DRL from this Pattern will be: `not Person( salary == ( $p.salary * 2 )
          )`
====
. A "From Accumulate" Conditional Element. This is maybe one of the most complex Patterns you can use. It consist in a Left Pattern (It must be a Fact Pattern. In this case is a Number Pattern. The Number is named $totalAddresses), a Source Pattern (Which could be a Fact Pattern, From, Collect or Accumulate conditional elements. In this case is an Address Pattern Restriction with a field restriction in its zip field) and a Formula Section where you can use any built-in or custom Accumulate Function (in this example a count() function is used). Basically, this Conditional Element will count the addresses having a zip code of 43240 from the Person's list of addresses.
+

[NOTE]
====
The generated DRL from this Pattern will be: `$totalAddresses : Number() from accumulate ($a :
          Address( zipCode == " 43240") from $p.addresses, count($a)) `
====
