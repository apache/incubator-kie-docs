= Test Scenario
:imagesdir: ..


Test Scenarios are used to validate that rules and knowledge base work as expected.
When the knowledge base evolves, Test Scenarios guard against regression.

.Example Test Scenario
image::Workbench/AuthoringAssets/TestScenario.png[align="center"]


Given section lists the facts needed for the behaviour.
Expect section lists the expected changes and actions done by the behaviour.
Given facts are passed for the Test Scenario before execution.
During the rule execution, changes in the knowledge base are recorded.
After the execution ends the recorded actions, existing facts in the knowledge base and knowledge base output is compared against the expectations.

== Knowledge Session Selector

.Knowledge Session Selector

Knowledge session selector is used to select the session that the rules are ran against.
The knowledge session needs to be stateful and use the pseudo clock when simulated time is used.
Knowledge sessions are defined in the Project Editor, in the Knowledge bases and Sessions section.

* Insert a new fact - Adds a new fact that will be inserted into the knowledge base before execution.
* Modify an existing fact - Allows editing a fact between knowledge base executions.
* Delete an existing fact - Allows removing facts between executions.
* Activate rule flow group - Allows rules from a rule flow group to be tested, by activating the group in advance.
