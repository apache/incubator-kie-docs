= Package
:imagesdir: ..


A package is a collection of rules and other related constructs, such as imports and globals.
The package members are typically related to each other - perhaps HR rules, for instance.
A package represents a namespace, which ideally is kept unique for a given grouping of rules.
The package name itself is the namespace, and is not related to files or folders in any way.

It is possible to assemble rules from multiple rule sources, and have one top level package configuration that all the rules are kept under (when the rules are assembled). Although, it is not possible to merge into the same package resources declared under different names.
A single Rulebase may, however, contain multiple packages built on it.
A common structure is to have all the rules for a package in the same file as the package declaration (so that is it entirely self-contained).

The following railroad diagram shows all the components that may make up a package.
Note that a package _must_ have a namespace and be declared using standard Java conventions for package names; i.e., no spaces, unlike rule names which allow spaces.
In terms of the order of elements, they can appear in any order in the rule file, with the exception of the `package` statement, which must be at the top of the file.
In all cases, the semicolons are optional.

Notice that any rule attribute (as described the section Rule Attributes) may also be written at package level, superseding the attribute's default value.
The modified default may still be replaced by an attribute setting within a rule.

Import statements work like import statements in Java.
You need to specify the fully qualified paths and type names for any objects you want to use in the rules.
Drools automatically imports classes from the Java package of the same name, and also from the package ``java.lang``.

== global

With `global` you define global variables.
They are used to make application objects available to the rules.
Typically, they are used to provide data or services that the rules use, especially application services used in rule consequences, and to return data from the rules, like logs or values added in rule consequences, or for the rules to interact with the application, doing callbacks.
Globals are not  inserted into the Working Memory, and therefore a global should never be used to establish conditions in rules except when it has a constant immutable value.
The engine cannot be notified about value changes of globals and does not track their changes.
Incorrect use of globals in constraints may yield surprising results - surprising in a bad way.

If multiple packages declare globals with the same identifier they must be of the same type and all of them will reference the same global value.

In order to use globals you must:

. Declare your global variable in your rules file and use it in rules. 
  For example:
+
{empty}
+
[source]
----
global java.util.List myGlobalList;

rule "Using a global"
when
    eval( true )
then
    myGlobalList.add( "Hello World" );
end
----
+
{empty}
. Set the global value on your working memory. It is a best practice to set all global values before asserting any fact to the working memory. Example:
+
[source,java]
----
List list = new ArrayList();
KieSession kieSession = kiebase.newKieSession();
kieSession.setGlobal( "myGlobalList", list );
----


Note that these are just named instances of objects that you pass in from your application to the working memory.
This means you can pass in any object you want: you could pass in a service locator, or perhaps a service itself.
With the new `from` element it is now common to pass a Hibernate session as a global, to allow `from` to pull data from a named Hibernate query.

One example may be an instance of a Email service.
In your integration code that is calling the rule engine, you obtain your emailService object, and then set it in the working memory.
In the DRL, you declare that you have a global of type EmailService, and give it the name "email". Then in your rule consequences, you can use things like email.sendSMS(number, message).

Globals are not designed to share data between rules and they should never be used for that purpose.
Rules always reason and react to the working memory state, so if you want to pass data from rule to rule, assert the data as facts into the working memory.

Care must be taken when changing data held by globals because the rule engine is not aware of those changes, hence cannot react to them.
