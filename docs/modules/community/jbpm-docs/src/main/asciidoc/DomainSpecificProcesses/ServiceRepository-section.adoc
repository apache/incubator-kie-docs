= Service Repository
:imagesdir: ..

A service repository allows easy discovery and use of existing services, as well as contributing new services to the jBPM community.
It should allow public access via URL as well as allow users to locally build and update it as they see fit. The content
of the service repository are domain-specific services that provide integration of your processes with different
types of systems. Their implementation should work out-of-the-box or with minimal configuration to the users.
Users can benefit from the service repository by having pre-tested and ready to use integration points
which they do not have to implement themselves.


== Public jBPM service repository

jBPM provides a public service repository which contains contributed reusable services:

https://docs.jboss.org/jbpm/service-repository/7.5.0.Final

This repository is dynamically generated from the https://github.com/kiegroup/jbpm-work-items[jBPM Workitems GitHub module].
It includes an user-friendly "Home Page" where you can view details about all services provied as well as download links to specific service definitions and implementation (jar).
jBPM tooling as for example the jBPM Designer can be used to discover this service repository and easily install these services into the
workbench for you to start using them inside business processes.

To start implementing and contributing your own service integration points please take a look at https://github.com/kiegroup/jbpm/tree/master/jbpm-workitems/jbpm-workitems-archetype[jBPM Workitems Archetype] module
which can get you up and running with a Maven project quickly. Otherwise feel free to contact someone from the dev team and we will be
happy to help you get started.

== Building and extending the jBPM Service Repository

You can build and extend the jBPM service repository locally. For this simply build the https://github.com/kiegroup/jbpm-work-items[jBPM work items module on GitHub].
The look/feel of the repository can be changed by updating the https://github.com/kiegroup/jbpm-work-items/tree/master/repository/src/main/resources[repository index file].
jBPM tooling can discover your repository even if it's not available on a public URL.

== Using repository workitems in your processes

Within the workbench you can use jBPM Designer editor to easily start importing your services into existing processes.
Inside Designer open up the workitem repository editor and type in the repository URL to connect to, for example

https://docs.jboss.org/jbpm/service-repository/7.5.0.Final

or if you build your repository locally it could look something like

file:///Users/tsurdilovic/devel/jbpm-work-items/repository/target/repository-7.5.0-SNAPSHOT

The repository import feature then will scan the workitem repository and list its content for you to start importing:


.Service repo import
image::DomainSpecificProcesses/ServiceRepoImport.png[width=60%]

Once imported, workitems are going to be included in the Designer shapes section when new processes are created or existing are re-opened.

Another option is to tell your app server that is running the KIE workbench to automatically install specific workitems from your repository
on workbench startup. This is a very nice option which saves time of having to manually import individual workitems
via the repository importer. It automatically registers your workitem handler and its maven dependencies to the workbench which is very handy (same is done via
the manual install using Designer).

For example let's say you have a service repository available at http://mysite.com/myservicerepo and there you have two services, namely BuyStock and SellStock.
To have these services automatically installed in the Workbench you can add the following startup parameters:
====
[source]
----
AS/bin/standalone.sh -Dorg.jbpm.service.repository=http://mysite.com/myservicerepo -Dorg.jbpm.service.servicetasknames=BuyStock,SellStock
----
====

Or if you wanted just the SellStock service installed:
====
[source]
----
AS/bin/standalone.sh -Dorg.jbpm.service.repository=http://mysite.com/myservicerepo -Dorg.jbpm.service.servicetasknames=SellStock
----
====

Currently there is no install-all option available so service names must be individually specified.
When creating a new or opening an existing business process then the Workbench will attempt to install the specified services from the provided repository URL.
This will install the service wid configuration, the spcified icon (if there is one or if not the Workbench will provide a default one for it), the default handler will be added to the deployment descriptor of your Workbench project as well as the specified maven dependencies in the service configuration will be added to the Workbench project pom.xml file.
Please note that currently there is no option to specify maven repositories via the service task configuration so they must be added via the Workbench in its POM Editor by the users.

== Setting up your own service repository

With previous versions of the jBPM Service repository users had to manually set up their workitem configuration (.wid) files as well as
provide jars and the maintain a repo configuratin file (index.conf). With the new version this is no longer the case and if you use Maven
most if not all of the repository artifacts can be generated for you.

If you do have an existing custom repository already set up be rest assured that it will still work as the
overall structure has not changed. In this case there are two things you will notice. One that there is no longer
the need for you to maintain the index.conf file which lists all your repository workitems, and two that you now
can add maven dependencies into your workitem configurations to define depends which can be pulled in at compile or runtime
rather than dependencies which you had to previously provide manually.

Ok, so let's see what are some easy ways to set up your own repository:

==== Create own workitem inside jBPM WorkItems module

Here you would clone the https://github.com/kiegroup/jbpm-work-items[jBPM WorkItems module] from GitHub and create
your own modules for your services. You can follow one of the existing modules to set up your own workitem implementation.
Once you have added your module to the list of modules in the https://github.com/kiegroup/jbpm-work-items/blob/master/pom.xml#L16[main pom], then
also add it to the https://github.com/kiegroup/jbpm-work-items/blob/master/repository/src/main/resources/index.html#L122[repository Home Page setup]
and you are good to go. Once you build the main module all the artifacts and the repository itself will be generated for you
under $moduleHome$/repository/target/repository-$version$.

This is a also a nice way to contribute your workitem impl to the community as it will be already set-up and ready
to do a pull request if you so choose so.

==== Create own workitem with the workitem Maven Archetype

We mentioned before the https://github.com/kiegroup/jbpm/tree/master/jbpm-workitems/jbpm-workitems-archetype[jBPM Workitem Archetype] module.
Creating a workitem project with this archetype will provide you with full generation of all elements needed for the repository.

To get started run the following maven command (update the archetypeVersion as needed):
====
[source]
----
mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=org.jbpm -DarchetypeArtifactId=jbpm-workitems-archetype -DarchetypeVersion=7.5.0-SNAPSHOT -DgroupId=org.jbpm.demo.workitems -DartifactId=myworkitem -DclassPrefix=MyWorkItem -DarchetypeCatalog=local -Dversion=1.0
----
====

This will create a base workitem project for you called myworkitem. If you within that workitem run
====
[source]
----
mvn clean install
----
====

you will find that the Maven build process will generate the workitem configuration, the implementation jar as well as
html that contains your workitem information in the myworkitem/jbpm-workitems-myworkitem/target/jbpm-workitems-myworkitem-1.0.zip file.
You can then simply extract the contents of this zip into your existing custom repository or anywhere on the file system. The zip will have
the following structure (for the base project):
====
[source]
----
index.conf
MyWorkItem/
  - MyWorkItem.json
  - MyWorkItem.wid
  - MyWorkItem.png
  - index.html
  - jbpm-workitems-myworkitem-1.0.jar
----
====

== Workitem Configuration (wid) from Handler Annotations

Generating the workitem configuration used to be a manual process which involved creating a workitem .wid file and having to know mvel
to define your workitem input/output parameters, handler, dependencies etc. You can still manually do that but we have added a way
to define your workitem configuration information in your workitem Java implementation using annotations. Here is an example of this approach
====
[source,java]
----
@Wid(widfile = "DropboxDownloadFileDefinitions.wid", name = "DropboxDownloadFile",
        displayName = "DropboxDownloadFile",
        defaultHandler = "mvel: new org.jbpm.process.workitem.dropbox.DownloadFileWorkitemHandler()",
        parameters = {
                @WidParameter(name = "DocumentPath")
        },
        results = {
                @WidResult(name = "Document")
        },
        mavenDepends = {
                @WidMavenDepends(group = "com.dropbox.core", artifact = "dropbox-core-sdk", version = "3.0.5")
        })
public class DownloadFileWorkitemHandler extends AbstractLogOrThrowWorkItemHandler {
...
}

----
====

Annotating your workitem handler implementation tells the jBPM Workitem Processor to use the defined
information by this annotation to generate the workitem configuration from. It has a number of different properties you can use:

* [property]``widFile``: defines the name of the generated config file
* [property]``name``: - unique name for your service
* [property]``displayName``: - display name to be used within editors such as jBPM Designer
* [property]``parameters``: - define the service data inputs given their name and type
* [property]``results``: - define the service data outputs
* [property]``mavenDepends``: - define a list of maven dependencies needed for your workitem to be executable at runtime.
* [property]``icon``: - should refer to a file with the given file name in the same folder as
  the extended configuration file (so it can be downloaded by the import wizard and used in the process
  diagrams).  Icons should be 16x16 GIF files.
* [property]``category``: - defines the category this service should be placed under when
  browsing the repository.
* [property]``defaultHandler``: -  defines the default handler implementation (i.e. the Java class that implements the `WorkItemHandler` interface and can be used to execute the service).  This can automatically be registered as the handler for that service when importing the service from the repository. You can also use mvel to resolve the default handler expression which has the additional benefit of being able to resolve the handlers parameters, for example:
====
[source]
----
"defaultHandler" : "mvel: new org.jbpm.process.workitem.twitter.TwitterHandler(ksession)",
----
====
Some of the available named parameters you can use are:
====
[source]
----
ksession
taskService
runtimeManager
classLoader
entityManagerFactory
----
====
* [property]``documentation``: - defines a documentation file that describes what the service does and how it works. This property should refer to a HTML file with the given name in the same folder as the extended configuration file (so it can be shown by the import wizard when browsing the repository).
* [property]``version``: - the version (String) of the workitem implmentation

Only setup needed for the @Wid annotation is to use an already provided annotation processor, namely
[source]
----
org.jbpm.process.workitem.core.util.WidProcessor
----
To add this in your projects pom.xml, you can define in the poms <plugins> section:
====
[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
    <configuration>
      <annotationProcessors>
        <annotationProcessor>org.jbpm.process.workitem.core.util.WidProcessor</annotationProcessor>
      </annotationProcessors>
      <compilerArgs>
        <arg>-AwidName=${project.artifactId}</arg>
      </compilerArgs>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
----
====

== Programatically interacting with the service repository

jBPM provides classes in the org.jbpm.process.workitem package which allows you to connect and retrieve your service information. For example:
[source,java]
----
Map<String, WorkDefinitionImpl> workitemsFromRepo =
  WorkItemRepository.getWorkDefinitions("https://docs.jboss.org/jbpm/service-repository/7.5.0.Final");
----
This will provide you with all services defined in the repository. You can then get more detailed information about each of services in the repository using their name as declared in the service wid file, for example we could do (for an example Workitem called "MyWorkitem"):
====
[source,java]
----
workitemsFromRepo.get( "MyWorkitem" ).getName();
workitemsFromRepo.get( "MyWorkitem" ).getDescription();
workitemsFromRepo.get( "MyWorkitem" ).getDefaultHandler();
workitemsFromRepo.get( "MyWorkitem" ).getMavenDependencies();
...
----
====
or you could for example check if the correct version of the service you need is contained in the repository:
====
[source]
----
if( workitemsFromRepo.containsKey( "MyWorkitem" ) && workitemsFromRepo.get( "MyWorkitem" ).getVersion().equals( "1.0" )) {
  // do something
}
----
====
Currently all operations are read-only. There isn't a way to update the service repository automatically.

== Defining extended service configuration with JSON
The previous extended configuration example for the Twitter service was defined with the default mvel configuration. It is also possible to do this with JSON and the Twitter example would look like this:
====
[source,json]
----
[
  [
    "java.util.HashMap",
    {
      "name":"TestServiceFour",
      "displayName":"Twitter",
      "description":"Send a Twitter message",
      "parameters":[
        "java.util.HashMap",
        {
          "Message":["org.jbpm.process.core.datatype.impl.type.StringDataType", {}]
        }
      ],
      "eclipse:customEditor":"org.drools.eclipse.flow.common.editor.editpart.work.SampleCustomEditor",
      "defaultHandler" : "org.jbpm.process.workitem.twitter.TwitterHandler",
      "documentation" : "index.html",
      "dependencies":[
        "java.util.ArrayList", ["file:./lib/jbpm-twitter.jar", "file:./lib/twitter4j-core-2.2.2.jar"]
      ]
    }
  ]
]
----
====
In your service repository you can define the extended configuration of your services with mvel or JSON (or have some defined in one way and some in the other as well).
Defining the extended configuration with JSON might have some benefits if being read by custom web-based clients for example but the mvel configuration option
is default and currently still prefered.
