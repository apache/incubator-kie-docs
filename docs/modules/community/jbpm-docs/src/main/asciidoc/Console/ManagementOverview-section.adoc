= Management Screens Overview

Before we get into the details for the different management concepts, let's explore the common features available in all areas.
We consider this kind of view as a set of visualization parameters that modify which items can be displayed and what information should be shown.

Common features include:

* Columns to be shown
* Items by page
* Sorting by column criteria
* Restrictions over the displayed items list provided by:
** Quick filter creation
** Saved filters management.
* General actions shared by all item list like 'Refresh'
* Specific actions depending on each screen.

We find here different areas with different purposes: Filtering, general section configuration
and specific view parameter setting in the data grid presentation:

- (1) Breadcrumb area: Contains breadcrumbs and the server template selector.
- (2) Filters area: Contains a dock for filter creation and a dock with saved filters
The docks are placed in the expandable panel on the left side of the screen.
The selections made inside any of the docks are immediately reflected in the table on the right.

That panels can be expanded or collapsed using the standard workbench docks controls.

*Filter dock*

Contains a set of available filters to create quick filters over the left side panel list.
Allows you to quickly find data related to Process Instances, Jobs, Tasks and Execution Errors.A set of pre defined filters
are defined into the related views. The user is able to restrict the data by adding new active filters.
This can be done by either selecting values from the dropdown list or providing values to the different attributes in
the input box.

You will notice that the data is filtered as you add or remove any of the active filters.

There are different types of filters:

-- Checkboxes (state and errors on the image):

Allow to select multiple values for one specific field. Any action on checkbox generate and applies that restriction
on the active filter.

-- Filter by:

Dropdown with the available fields to filter. Depending on the kind of field the input box have different
allowed values (numeric or any text)

-- Dropdown filled with specific values. (ie: in this process instances list it is filled with the available Process names)

-- Date fields filter:

Once of the filter box is selected a list of date predefined filters like 'Last Hour', 'Today',.. are displayed, and also
the posibility of define a custom range of dates

At the end of this dock there is the option to create a new saved 'Advanced Filter'. When the user selects it, a
"New Item list" popup appears and let to introduce parameters related with the new filter like the name, the description
 and the filter restrictions.

If the view has to include a restriction over a specific column, then the link 'Add new' has to be selected. A drop down
list with all the columns to create restrictions

Once the column is selected, depending of its type, a new dropdown list is open with the kind of restrictions available
for the selected column and the necessary form to add them.

One filter can include a list of different conditions over different columns and the editor allow remove each one
clicking th 'x' button near them

Once the view creation parameters are defined, the 'Ok' button launch the defined filter saving and
applies that on the list.

*Saved Filter dock*

The 'Saved filters' dock allows manage the stored filters: It present a list with the current stored filters

*** Filters can be deleted
*** The defaults filters can be always restored as in the previous version with the 'Restore default filters' button.
*** Filters can be applied: When a user selects one filter, that is applied on the current list and the 'Active filters'
 displays the restrictions contained in that filter.

*** The user has the ability to modify/complete filters and save it to be reused later. The new way to save filter
is selecting 'Save filters' at 'Active filters' area. A name for the new saved filter is requested and a new filter
with the current restrictions is added to 'Saved filters' list.

It's not allowed to have filters with the same name. When the user tries to save a filter with an existing name, currently an error is shown.
