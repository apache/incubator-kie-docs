= Human Resources Example
:imagesdir: ..


The Human Resource Example's use case can be described as follows: A company wants to hire new developers.
In this process, three departments (that is the Human resources, IT, and Accounting) are involved.
These departments are represented by three users: Katy, Jack, and John respectively. 

.Business Process

Note that only four out of the six defined activities within the business process are User Tasks.
User Tasks require human interaction.
The other two tasks are Service Tasks, which are automated and connected to other systems. 

Each instance of the process will follow certain actions: 

* The human resources team performs the initial interview with the candidate. 
* The IT department team performs the technical interview. 
* Based on the output from the previous two steps, the accounting team creates a job proposal. 
* When the proposal has been drafted, it is automatically sent to the candidate via email. 
* If the candidate accepts the proposal, a new meeting to sign the contract is scheduled. 
* Finally, if the candidate accepts the proposal, the system posts a message about the new hire using Twitter service connector. 


Note, that Jack, John, and Katy represent any employee within the company with appropriate role assigned.

== Building the Human Resources Example


To build the Project: 

. Click **menu:Authoring[Project Authoring]**. 
. Click the project name. 
. Click "Build & Deploy". 

btn:[Build & Deploy]
 creates a new JAR artifact that is deployed to the runtime environment as a new deployment unit.

After successfully building and deploying your project, you can verify its presence in the [label]#Deployments#
 tab.
Click *menu:Deploy[Deployments]* to do so. 

.Deployment Units Section
image::Examples/human-resources-deployment-screen.png[]


You can find all the deployed units in the [label]#Deployments#
 tab.
When you btn:[Build & Deploy]
 a project from the Project Editor, it is deployed using the default configurations.
That means using the Singleton Strategy, the default Kie Base and the default Kie Session. 

If you want a more advanced deployment, undeploy and re-deploy your artifacts using their GAV and selecting non-default settings.
Then, you will be able to set a different strategy, or use a non-default Kie Base or Kie Session. 

Once your artifact that contains the process definition is deployed, the Process Definition will become available in **menu:Process Management[Process Definitions]**. 

== Create a new Process Instance


To create new process instances: 

Click **menu:Process Management[Process Definitions]**. 

Start your instance: 

.Starting Process Instances
image::Examples/human-resources-process-definitions.png[caption="You can start process instances using any of the two highlighted options."]

The [label]#Process Definitions#
 tab contains all the available process definitions in the runtime environment.
In order to add new process definitions, build and deploy a new project. 

Most processes require additional information to create a new process instance.
This is done through forms.
For this project, fill in the name of the candidate that is to be interviewed. 

When you click btn:[Submit]
, you create a new process instance.
This creates the first task, that is available for the Human Resources team.
To see the task, you need to logout and log in as a user with the appropriate role assigned, that is someone from the Human Resources. 

When you start the process, you can interact with the human tasks.
To do so, click **menu:Task[Tasks]**. 

Note that in order to see the tasks in the task list, you need to belong to specific user groups, for which the task is designed.
For example, the HR Interview task is visible only for the members of the HR group, and the Tech Interview Task is visible only to the members of the IT group.
