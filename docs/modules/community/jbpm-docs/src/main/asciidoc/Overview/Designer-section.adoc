:imagesdir: ..


The web-based jBPM Designer allows you to model your business processes in a web-based environment.
It is targeted towards business users and offers a graphical editor for viewing and editing your business processes (using drag and drop), similar to the Eclipse plugin.
It supports round-tripping between the Eclipse editor and the web-based designer.
It also supports simulation of processes.
