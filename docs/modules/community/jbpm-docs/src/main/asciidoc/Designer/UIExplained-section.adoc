Designer UI is composed of a number of sections as shown below:

* (1) Modelling Canvas - this is your process drawing board. After dropping different shapes onto the canvas, you can move them around, connect them, etc. Clicking on a shape on the canvas allows you to set its properties in the expandable Properties Window (3) (as well as create connecting shapes and morph the shape into other shapes).
* (2) Toolbar - the toolbar contains a vast number of functions offered by Designer (described later). These includes operations that can be performed on shapes present on the Canvas. Individual operations are disabled or enabled depending on what is selected. For example, if no shapes are selected, the Cut/Paste/Delete operations are disabled, and become enabled once you select a shape. Hovering over the icons in the Toolbar displays the description text of the operation.
* (3) Properties Panel - this expandable section on the right side of Designer allows you to set both process and shape properties. It is divided into four sections, namely "Core properties", "Extra Properties, "Graphical Settings" and "Simulation Properties". After clicking on a shape in the Canvas, this panel is reloaded to show properties specific to that shape type. If you click on the canvas itself (not on a shape) the panel displays general process properties.
* (4) Object Library Panel - the expandable section on the left side of Designer shows the jBPM BPMN2 (default) shape repository tree. It includes all shapes of the jBPM BPMN2 stencil set which can be used to assemble your processes. If you expand each section sub-group you can see the BPMN2 elements that can be placed onto the Designer Canvas (1) by dragging and dropping the shape onto it.
* (5) View Tabs - currently Designer offers three tabs for Process Modelling, Simulation and Documentation. Process Modelling is the default tab. When users run process simulation, its results are presented in the Simulation tab. Process Documentation tab displays documentation generated from process definition.
* (6) Info Tabs - there are two additional tabs at the top of Designer. The Editor tab includes the process modeling while the Overview tab displays the process metadata such as version history, creation date, last modification date etc.
