This chapter will describe how to deal with unexpected behavior in your business processes using both BPMN2 and technical mechanisms.

The first section will explain Technical Exceptions: we'll go through an example that uses both BPMN2 and  `WorkItemHandler` implementations in order to isolate and handle exceptions caused by a technical component.
We will also explain how to modify the example to suit other use cases.

The second section will define and explain the types of (BPMN2) exceptions that can happen or be used in a business process.
