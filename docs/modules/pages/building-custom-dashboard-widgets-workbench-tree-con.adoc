= Navigation tree

The *Workbench* navigation tree contains the entries that are displayed in {CENTRAL}'s *Main* menu. Changes to this navigation tree structure will be reflected in the *Main* menu on the Home page. Such mechanism can be used, for example, to publish new pages.

Also, additional navigation trees can be created. These custom trees can be used to configure the navigation components within a page. You cannot delete the *Workbench* tree from the *Navigation* panel but you can edit the *Workbench* tree hierarchy to suit your requirements. This feature helps users customize the *Main* menu of {CENTRAL} with new pages.

[NOTE]
====
The *Workbench* tree, which appears by default in the *Navigation* panel, is the main *Menu* of {CENTRAL}.
