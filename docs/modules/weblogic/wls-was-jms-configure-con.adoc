= Configuring Java Message Service (JMS)

The Java Message Service (JMS) is a Java API that {KIE_SERVER} uses to exchange messages with other application servers such as {WEBLOGIC} and {WEBSPHERE}. You must configure your application server to send and receive JMS messages through {KIE_SERVER} to ensure proper collaboration between the two servers.
