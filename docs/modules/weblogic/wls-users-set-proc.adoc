[IMPORTANT]
====
Make sure that the selected user name does not conflict with any known title of a role or a group. For example, if there is a role called `kie-server`, then do not create a user with the user name `kie-server`.
====
. Click the newly created user, then return to the *Groups* tab.
. Use the selection tool to move the `kie-server` group from the *Available* field to the *Chosen* field, and click *Save*.
