[id='_migrating_to_6.4']
== Migrating from 6._X_ to 6.4

The `org.drools.core.command.runtime.rule.ModifyCommand` API is no longer backward compatible in case you create the XML form manually and the Drools engine is using JAXB for unmarshalling. This problem does not occur when the Drools engine uses XStream for unmarshalling. Because the `FactHandle` object is marshalled differently into the XML, you need to modify the content of the `<modify>` element in your XML accordingly.

For example:

.{PRODUCT} 6._X_ ModifyCommand XML
[source,xml]
----
<modify ...>
  ...
  <fact-handle>0:1:1134443700:1:1:DEFAULT:NON_TRAIT:null</fact-handle>
  ...
</modify>
----

Needs to be transformed, for example:

.{PRODUCT} 6.4 ModifyCommand XML 
[source,XML]
----
<modify ...>
  ...
  <fact-handle external-form="0:1:1134443700:1:1:DEFAULT:NON_TRAIT:null">
    <id>1</id>
    <identityHashCode>1134443700</identityHashCode>
    <objectHashCode>1</objectHashCode>
    <recency>1</recency>
    <entryPointId>DEFAULT</entryPointId>
    <traitType>NON_TRAIT</traitType>
  </fact-handle>
  ...
</modify>
----

It is recommended to use a marshaller. In such case, no changes are necessary.

*org.jbpm.rule.task.waitstate*

When set to `false`, a business rule task automatically fires all rules instead of waiting to be triggered from the process event listener or an outside call. This behavior prevents errors during heavy multithreaded usage, however if `org.jbpm.rule.task.waitstate` is set to `false`, the business task is no longer a safe point.

For information about safe points, see the
 https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-jboss-bpm-suite/6.4/single/administration-and-configuration-guide/#chap_persistence[_{PRODUCT} Administration and Configuration Guide_].

NOTE: Starting with {PRODUCT} 6.4 the default for `org.jbpm.rule.task.waitstate` is `false`. For more information, see the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_bpm_suite/6.4/html/6.4_release_notes/chap_fixed_issues#miscellaneous[_{PRODUCT} 6.4 Release Notes_].

[id='_migrating_from_6.x_to_6.3_with_upgrade_tool']
=== Migrating from 6._X_ to 6.3 Using Upgrade Tool

[WARNING]
====
Upgrading from {PRODUCT} 6.1._X_ to {PRODUCT} 6.3 directly may lead to {KIE_SERVER} templates configuration issues.
====

If you are running {PRODUCT} 6.1._X_ or 6.2._X_, you can use the {PRODUCT} upgrade tool to upgrade to {PRODUCT} 6.3. To do so, see the section {URL_INSTALLATION_GUIDE}#upgrading_to_latest_minor_release[Upgrading to Latest Minor Release] in the {PRODUCT} Install Guide for instructions.

In case you wish to upgrade {PRODUCT} 6.0._X_, you must first upgrade to version 6.2 as described in <<_migrating_business_central_project_repository_and_artifacts_from_6.0.x_to_6.2>>, and use the upgrade tool on the upgraded version.

The {PRODUCT} upgrade tool upgrades only the distribution files from version 6.2._X_ or version 6.1._X_ to version 6.3; you must perform the database upgrade manually. See <<_upgrading_db_to_6.3>>.

[NOTE]
====
In case your runtime data and audit data are in separate databases in {PRODUCT}, it is necessary to merge them to a single database before using {PRODUCT} 6.3.
====


[id='_migrating_business_central_project_repository_and_artifacts_from_6.x_to_6.3_manually']
=== Migrating Business Central Project, Repository, and Artifacts from 6._X_ to 6.3 Manually

[NOTE]
====
The manual upgrade process described in this section is the same for all versions of {PRODUCT} starting with 6.1._X_.  For version 6.0._X_, you need to upgrade to version 6.2 first (see <<_migrating_business_central_project_repository_and_artifacts_from_6.0.x_to_6.2>>).
====


The recommended method of upgrading {PRODUCT} 6._X_ Git projects (`.niogit` folder) and Maven local dependencies (`bin/repositories`) manually is to copy over these directories to the new installation. This process will copy over all projects and artifacts.

.Procedure: Migrate the Git Repository
. Turn off {PRODUCT} 6._X_ and 6.3 instances.
. Navigate to the `.niogit` directory, found in the home directory of the {PRODUCT} 6._X_ installation.
. Copy this directory and any subdirectories to the `.niogit` directory of the {PRODUCT} 6.3 installation:
+
[source]
----
cp -R ./ $BPM_6.3_INSTALLATION/.niogit/
----

.Procedure: Migrate the Maven Repository
. Turn off {PRODUCT} 6._X_ and 6.3 instances.
. Navigate to the `repositories` directory, found in the home directory of the {PRODUCT} 6._X_ installation.
. Copy this directory and any subdirectories to the `repositories` directory of the {PRODUCT} 6.3 installation:
+
[source]
----
cp -R ./ $BPM_6.3_INSTALLATION/repositories/
----


[id='_upgrading_db_to_6.3']
=== Upgrading the Database from 6._X_ to 6.3


Regardless of whether you chose to upgrade the {PRODUCT} distribution files manually (according to <<_migrating_business_central_project_repository_and_artifacts_from_6.x_to_6.3_manually>>), or using the upgrade tool (<<_migrating_from_6.x_to_6.3_with_upgrade_tool>>), you must update the database separately by following instructions in <<_sect_database_migration_for_6.x_instances>>.


=== {KIE_SERVER} and Container Migration

If you are migrating from {PRODUCT} 6.2 to a higher version, the {KIE_SERVER} templates are automatically migrated. The controller configuration resides in the system GIT repository and is migrated automatically. However, if you are migrating from {PRODUCT} 6.1 to 6.3 or above, the container data is not automatically migrated due to the difference in controller data structure in version 6.1. To retain the container data, first upgrade to {PRODUCT} 6.2 and then to {PRODUCT} 6.3. Optionally, you can recreate the container data in your upgraded version of {PRODUCT}.

=== Migrating Client Application APIs from 6.1._X_ to 6.2

In this section, we will discuss the migration steps that are specific to migrating from {PRODUCT} 6.1._X_ to 6.2. While the majority of settings and API have remained the same, the differences are highlighted below.


[float]
==== jBPM Executor (embedded mode)

The jBPM Executor has now been exposed as a public API available in the KIE API.
In the event that the `jbpm-executor` service was in use previously, with embedded environments, it is recommended to now create the jBPM Executor using the API.


[float]
==== Deprecated methods

The [method]``TaskSummary.getPotentialOwners()`` is now deprecated and slated for removal.

[float]
==== Update IDs from primitive types


Many IDs were changed from the primitive `long` to the Object ``Long``. While Java can perform auto-casting of these primitive types, it is recommended to update any uses of the following methods to avoid potential issues:
[source]
----
org.kie.api.task.model.Content.getId();
org.kie.api.task.model.TaskData.getOutputContentId();
org.kie.api.task.TaskService.addComment();

[id='_migrating_business_central_project_repository_and_artifacts_from_6.1.x_to_6.2']
=== Migrating Business Central Project, Repository, and Artifacts from 6.1._X_ to 6.2


The recommended method of upgrading the {PRODUCT} 6.1._X_ Git projects (`.niogit`
 folder) and Maven local dependencies (`bin/repositories`
 is to copy over these directories to the new installation.
This process will copy over all projects and artifacts.

.Procedure: Migrate the Git Repository
. Turn off {PRODUCT} 6.1._X_ and 6.2 instances.
. Navigate to the `.niogit` directory, found in the home directory of the {PRODUCT} 6.1 installation.
. Copy this directory and any subdirectories to the `.niogit` directory of the {PRODUCT} 6.2 installation:
+
[source]
----
cp -R ./$BPM_6.2_INSTALLATION/.niogit/
----

.Procedure: Migrate the Maven Repository
. Turn off {PRODUCT} 6.1._X_ and 6.2 instances.

[id='_upgrading_the_database_6.1.x_to_6.2']
=== Upgrading the Database from 6.1._X_ to 6.2

Ensure the database has been upgraded as documented in <<_sect_database_migration_for_6.x_instances>>.

[id='_migrating_client_application_apis_from_6.0.x_to_6.1']
=== Migrating Client Application APIs from 6.0._X_ to 6.1

In this section, we will discuss the migration steps that are specific to migrating from {PRODUCT} 6.0._X_ to 6.1.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When using Red Hat JBoss BRMS/{PRODUCT} prior to 6.1 deployed on Red Hat JBoss EAP, it was possible to load JBoss BRMS/{PRODUCT} libraries from the JBoss EAP modules by correctly configuring `jboss-deployment-structure.xml`.
In Red Hat JBoss BRMS and {PRODUCT} 6.1, there are no modules including Red Hat JBoss BRMS/{PRODUCT} libraries, hence the application developer is responsible to ensure all dependencies will be resolvable during runtime.
For more information, see the {URL_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE}#red_hat_jboss_brms_key_components[Red Hat JBoss BRMS Key Components] section of the {DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE}.
====

[float]
==== Remove Old API


As noted in <<_api_and_backwards_compatibility>>, 6.1 is _not_ backwards compatible with the 5._X_ API, while 6.0._X_ was. Therefore, when migrating from 6.0._X_ to 6.1 version, you will need to remove all references to the old API.

[float]
==== Modify Your (Custom) persistence.xml


There have been several changes in the classes present in the `persistence.xml` file. If you have been using a custom file for persistence, then you need to be aware of these changes and implement them:

* The Task Audit classes have changed from:
+
[source]
----
<class>org.jbpm.services.task.audit.impl.model.GroupAuditTaskImpl</class>
<class>org.jbpm.services.task.audit.impl.model.HistoryAuditTaskImpl</class>
<class>org.jbpm.services.task.audit.impl.model.UserAuditTaskImpl</class>
----
to:
+
[source]
----
<class>org.jbpm.services.task.audit.impl.model.AuditTaskImpl</class>
----

* The Event class has changed from:
+
[source]
----
<class>org.jbpm.services.task.audit.TaskEventImpl</class>
----
to:
+
[source]
----
<class>org.jbpm.services.task.audit.impl.model.TaskEventImpl</class>
----

* There is a new entry for the deployment store:
+
[source]
----
<class>org.jbpm.kie.services.impl.store.DeploymentStoreEntry</class>
----
* There are some new mapping files that need adding:
+
[source]
----
<mapping-file>META-INF/Taskorm.xml</mapping-file>
<mapping-file>META-INF/Servicesorm.xml</mapping-file>
<mapping-file>META-INF/TaskAuditorm.xml</mapping-file>
----


[float]
==== Migrating Classes

6.1 has migrated some API classes to the Services API (and access to those classes has been removed). If you were using these APIs because no alternative was available earlier, migrate to these new classes:
[source]
----
old --> new
org.kie.internal.deployment.DeployedUnit; --> org.jbpm.services.api.model.DeployedUnit;
org.kie.internal.deployment.DeploymentService; -->  org.jbpm.services.api.DeploymentService;
org.kie.internal.deployment.DeploymentUnit; --> org.jbpm.services.api.model.DeploymentUnit;
org.jbpm.kie.services.api.IdentityProvider; --> org.kie.internal.identity.IdentityProvider;
----


[float]
==== Make Changes to Module Ids in Your POMs

The following ids have changed:
[source]
----
old --> new
kie-services-jaxb --> kie-remote-jaxb
kie-services-client --> kie-remote-client
kie-services-remote --> kie-remote-services
----


[float]
==== Review JMS Port Changes

In 6.1, `4447` is the JNDI port to discover JMS [class]``ConnectionFactory`` connection and to get queues.
Port `5445` is used by default for unsecured JMS communication.
Port `5446` is used by default for SSL secured JMS communication.

In 6.0._X_, only port `4447` was necessary to get the JMS [class]``ConnectionFactory``. This factory provided JMS queues and no other port setting was necessary.

[float]
==== Verify Location of Deployment Units


In 6.1, deployment units are located inside the database.
In 6.0, these were stored in the Git repository.
If you want to continue storing your deployment units within the Git repo, you must use the system property [property]``org.kie.git.deployments.enabled`` and set it to true.

This change is backward compatible.
The first time a deployment is run on a new setup it will read up from `system.git` and deploy into runtime (in database storage). At the same time it will remove it from system Git to clean it up.

[float]
==== Modify Remote Class API Code


Between 6.0._X_ and 6.1, the Remote Class API has changed considerably.
For example, in 6.0._X_, you would use the following code for creating a JMS based runtime engine:
[source]
----
import org.kie.services.client.api.command.RemoteRuntimeEngine;
...
RemoteJmsRuntimeEngineBuilder rjmsreBuilder = RemoteJmsRuntimeEngineFactory.newBuilder().addJbossServerHostName(host).addHostName(host).addUserName(username).addPassword(password).addTimeout(timeout).addDeploymentId(deploymentId).addExtraJaxbClasses(classes);

if( useSsl ) {
  rjmsreBuilder.addKeystoreLocation("client0.keystore.jks").addKeystorePassword(storePassword).addTruststorePassword(storePassword).useKeystoreAsTruststore().addJmsConnectorPort(sslPort);
  } else {
    rjmsreBuilder.useSsl(false).addJmsConnectorPort(port);
  }

RemoteRuntimeEngine remoteRuntimeEngine = rjmsreBuilder.build();
----

or the following code for creating a REST based runtime engine:
[source]
----
remoteRuntimeEngine = RemoteRestRuntimeEngineFactory.newBuilder().addUrl(url).addUserName(username).addPassword(password).addDeploymentId(deploymentId).addExtraJaxbClasses(classes).build();
----

This code should be modified as the Remote Class API defines new generalized interface for remote runtime engine: `org.kie.api.runtime.manager.RuntimeEngine`. To create the runtime engines in 6.1, use the following code (JMS):

[source]
----
// for JMS
import org.kie.api.runtime.manager.RuntimeEngine;
...

RemoteJmsRuntimeEngineBuilder rjmsreBuilder = RemoteRuntimeEngineFactory.newJmsBuilder().addJbossServerHostName(host).addHostName(host).addUserName(username).addPassword(password).addTimeout(timeout).addDeploymentId(deploymentId).addExtraJaxbClasses(classes);

// 5446 is the default secured jms port, 5445 the default unsecured jms port
if ( port == 5446 ) {
  rjmsreBuilder.addKeystoreLocation("client0.keystore.jks").addKeystorePassword(storePassword).addTruststorePassword(storePassword).useKeystoreAsTruststore().addJmsConnectorPort(port);

  sslStatus = "enabled";
} else if (port == 5445) {
  rjmsreBuilder
    .useSsl(false)
    .disableTaskSecurity()
    .addJmsConnectorPort(port);
  sslStatus = "disabled";
  } else {
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unsupported jms port, valid ones are secured 5446 and unsecured 5445.");
  }

  RuntimeEngine remoteRuntimeEngine = rjmsreBuilder.build();
----


and the following code for REST:
[source]
----
remoteRuntimeEngine = remoteRuntimeEngineFactory.newRestBuilder().addUrl(url).addUserName(username).addPassword(password).addDeploymentId(deploymentId).addExtraJaxbClasses(classes).build();
----


[float]
==== Rename the AuditLogService Class

If you were using the [class]``AuditLogService`` in 6.0._X_ branch, migrate that to the renamed class: [class]``AuditService``.
Method names have changed accordingly: `remoteRuntimeEngine.getAuditLogService()` should be changed to ``remoteRuntimeEngine.getAuditService()``.


[id='_migrating_business_central_project_repository_and_artifacts_from_6.0.x_to_6.1']
=== Migrating Business Central Project, Repository and Artifacts from 6.0._X_ to 6.1

[float]
==== Migrating a Repository

The following procedure demonstrates how to migrate a selected {PRODUCT} 6.0._X_ repository to {PRODUCT} 6.1.0 installation.

.Procedure: Clone and Migrate a Repository
. Turn on {PRODUCT} 6.1.0.
. Log in to Business Central and navigate to *Authoring* -> *Administration* -> *Repositories* -> *Clone Repository*.
. Fill in the form. For example:
+
[source]
----
Repository Name - MyOld603Repo
Organizational Unit - example
Git URL - file:///path/to/old/603/.niogit/repository.git
----
+
and press *Confirm*.

. The repository should be now available for Authoring.

For more information about cloning repositories, see the {URL_ADMIN_GUIDE}#cloning_a_repository[{ADMIN_GUIDE}].

.Migrate a Maven Artifact
The Artifact Repository is an internal Maven repository for {PRODUCT}. The default internal Maven repository is created in a working directory of {PRODUCT} 6.1.0 installation, with the folder name `repositories/kie` .

Maven artifacts can be migrated using the GUI.

.Procedure: Migrate Maven Artifacts using the GUI
. Turn on {PRODUCT} 6.1.
. Navigate to *Authoring* -> *Artifact Repository*.
. Upload the Artifact from your old 6.0.3 installation.

Alternatively, the following procedure demonstrates how to migrate selected Maven artifact from {PRODUCT} 6.0._X_ Artifact Repository to a {PRODUCT} 6.1.0 Artifact Repository, and assumes that the two Artifact Repositories are located on the same physical system.

.Procedure: Migrate a Particular Artifact
. Consider following KJAR, which was installed into {PRODUCT} 6.0._X_ Artifact Repository by Business Central:
+
.Installed KJAR
image::7117.png[KJAR installed]

. Copy this artifact to the {PRODUCT} 6.1.0 Artifact Repository. For example:
+
[source]
----
$ cp -R --parents /path/to/603/kjar/kie/org/redhat/gss/TimerProject/
/path/to/bpms-610-psql/bin/repositories/
----
+
The `--parents` argument will ensure that all the necessary folders (if missing) will be created in 6.1.0 too.
In this case, it will honor the `/org/redhat/gss/TimerProject`
path.
+
After copying, the 6.1.0 Maven repository should look appear as follows:
+
.Copied Artifact

The `--parents` argument will ensure that all the necessary folders (if missing) will be created in 6.2.0 too.
In this case, it will honor the `/org/redhat/gss/TimerProject`
path.

. Start the {PRODUCT} 6.2.0 installation and navigate to Artifact Repository. The copied artifact should be present as shown:

.Migrate the .niogit Folder
In order to migrate the whole `.niogit` from 6.0._X_ to 6.2.0, set the [property]``org.uberfire.nio.git.dir`` property in 6.2.0 as follows.

[id='_upgrading_the_database_6.0.x_to_6.2']
=== Upgrading the Database from 6.0._X_ to 6.2

Ensure that the database has been upgraded as documented in <<_sect_database_migration_for_6.x_instances>>.


[id='_sect_database_migration_for_6.x_instances']
== Database Migration for 6.x Instances

Due to data model changes the database schema has also changed between minor versions of {PRODUCT}. A set of scripts has been included to ease this migration process; these scripts will generate the new tables and columns necessary, in addition to populating these columns where appropriate.

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is strongly recommended to backup the database before attempting any update, as this will provide a recoverable state should any issues arise during the update process.
====

. Download and unzip the [path]_{PRODUCT} Supplementary Tools_ from the Customer Portal.
. Shutdown any {PRODUCT} servers communicating with the database.
. Navigate to the subdirectory of supplementary tools corresponding to the type of database used. For instance, if a `h2` database is in use (the default), then the scripts in the `upgrade-scripts/h2` directory will be used in the subsequent steps.
. Examine the contents of each script to be executed. While many of the scripts contain only database changes, there are others that require commands to be executed from a client with an open connection to the database.
. Execute the scripts corresponding to the following table. If there are more scripts listed for your upgrade path, you must execute all of them, and in the specified order:
+

.Database Scripts by Version
[cols="1,1,1", options="header"]
|===
| Original {PRODUCT} Version
| New {PRODUCT} Version
| Script(s) to execute

| 6.2
| 6.3
|`bpms-6.2-to-6.3.sql`

| 6.1
| 6.3
| bpms-6.1-to-6.2.sql, bpms-6.2-to-6.3.sql

| 6.1
| 6.2
|`bpms-6.1-to-6.2.sql`

| 6.0
| 6.3
| bpms-6.0-to-6.1.sql, bpms-6.1-to-6.2.sql, bpms-6.2-to-6.3.sql

| 6.0
| 6.2
| bpms-6.0-to-6.1.sql, bpms-6.1-to-6.2.sql

| 6.0
| 6.1
|`bpms-6.0-to-6.1.sql`
|===

. Start the new {PRODUCT} server.


[id='_running_processes']
== Migrating Running Processes


To migrate these processes, follow the below steps:

. Shutdown any active {PRODUCT} servers using the older version.
+

[IMPORTANT]
====
When the server is shutdown, all processes will be terminated, and only the processes that have been persisted to the database will migrate smoothly.
Before shutting down the {PRODUCT} server, ensure that all rules are either waiting on a human task (so that they will be persisted), or not actively executing.
====

. Ensure the instructions in <<_sect_database_migration_for_6.x_instances>> have been followed to upgrade the database to the new version.
. Start the new {PRODUCT} server, pointing to the same database that was previously in use.
. Now you need to migrate your Maven and Git repositories. The process for doing that depends on which version you are migrating to:
+
[horizontal]
*6.3*:: Use either the upgrade tool in <<_migrating_from_6.x_to_6.3_with_upgrade_tool>>, or do it manually as described in <<_migrating_business_central_project_repository_and_artifacts_from_6.x_to_6.3_manually>>.
*6.2*:: See <<_migrating_business_central_project_repository_and_artifacts_from_6.1.x_to_6.2>> or <<_migrating_business_central_project_repository_and_artifacts_from_6.0.x_to_6.2>>, based on the version of your current {PRODUCT} installation.
*6.1*:: See <<_migrating_business_central_project_repository_and_artifacts_from_6.0.x_to_6.1>>.
. At this point, the processes will be retrieved from the backing database and may be used as normal.


[NOTE]
====
Due to the database changes, the server must be offline temporarily while the database is updated, and as such a true migration with no downtime does not exist.
To minimize downtime, it is recommended to use a load balancer in front of the {PRODUCT} servers and delegate requests to older instances until the full migration has completed.
Once the database upgrade has completed and the new {PRODUCT} servers started successfully, requests may be sent to these servers, which will retrieve the persisted process.
