= Migrating Java project data

Projects that you developed in Java code in {PRODUCT_OLD} 6.4 (for example, in Eclipse) also require modification for {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}. You must update the dependencies in the `pom.xml` file for each project, upgrade the database configured for the project, and rebuild the project. To migrate your Java client applications, you also must update the dependencies in the `pom.xml` file for each project. If your application uses embedded {PRODUCT_OLD} engines (jBPM, Drools, OptaPlanner), this change also updates the engines. If the application calls the {KIE_SERVER}, the API client library is updated.
