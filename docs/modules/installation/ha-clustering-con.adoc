= High availability and clustering

High availability  describes a system or component that is continuously operational, or available, for a desirably long length of time. You can measure availability relative to the unattainable value of 100% available, or never failing. A common but difficult-to-achieve standard of availability for a system or product is known as "five 9s" (99.999 percent) availability.

High-availability (HA) clusters are groups of services that can be used with a minimum or no down-time. Without clustering, if a service crashes or is too busy, the user asking for that service will not get a quick response. With high availability clustering, mulitple nodes provide copies of data and services. A service watchdog detects a failure on one node of the cluster, restarts the failed node, and simultaneously switches service to another node. In most cases the failure is not visible or noticeable to the user.

See <<clustering-con>> for information on how to set up a high availability cluster with {PRODUCT}.
