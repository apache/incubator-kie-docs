problems. It helps Java programmers solve planning problems efficiently, and it combines
optimization heuristics and metaheuristics with efficient score calculations.

* _Employee/Patient Rosters_: It helps create timetables for nurses and keeps track of patient bed management.
* _Educational Timetables_: It helps schedule lessons, courses, exams, and conference presentations.
* _Shop Schedules_: It tracks car assembly lines, machine queue planning, and workforce task planning.
* _Cutting Stock_: It minimizes waste by reducing the consumption of resources such as paper and steel.

Every organization faces planning problems. They provide products and services with a limited set of constrained resources (employees, assets, time, and money).
