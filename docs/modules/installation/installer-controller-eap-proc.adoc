= Using the installer to configure {KIE_SERVER} with the Process Automation Manager controller

{KIE_SERVER} can be managed by the Process Automation Manager controller or it can be unmanaged. If {KIE_SERVER} is unmanaged, you must manually create and maintain containers. If {KIE_SERVER} is managed, the Process Automation Manager controller manages the {KIE_SERVER} configuration and you interact with the controller to create and maintain containers. 

The Process Automation Manager controller is integrated with {CENTRAL}. If you install {CENTRAL}, you can use the *Execution Server* page in {CENTRAL} to interact with the controller. 

You can use the installer in interactive or CLI mode to install {CENTRAL} and {KIE_SERVER}, and then configure {KIE_SERVER} with the {CENTRAL} Controller.

[NOTE]
====
If you do not install {CENTRAL}, see <<controller-con>> for information about using the headless Process Automation Manager controller.
