Use the Project perspective to enable or disable the `GroupId`, `ArtifactId`, and `Version` (GAV) conflict check and allow or forbid child GAV editions. 

When enabled, this check verifies that the artifact with a specific GAV does not already exists in maven repositories managed by {CENTRAL}. If the artifact does exist, a dialog box appears asking whether to override this artifact or cancel the deployment of the artifact to the maven repository.

When disabled, there is no check and artifacts are always overwritten, even when artifacts with a specific GAV already exists in the repository.

If you access the Project perspective from the Settings menu, any changes you make will apply to all projects, with the exception noted in the following paragraph.

The Project perspective is also available from each project through the *Preferences* button. If you access the Project perspective from within a project, the changes that you make apply only to that project and they override any changes that you make to the Project perspective accessed from the Settings menu.
