= Maven Repositories

Maven uses repositories to store Java libraries, plug-ins, and other build artifacts. These repositories can be local or remote. {PRODUCT} maintains local and remote maven repositories that you can add to your project for accessing the rules, processes, events, and other project dependencies. You must configure Maven to use these repositories and the Maven Central Repository to provide correct build functionality.

When building projects and archetypes, Maven dynamically retrieves Java libraries and Maven plug-ins from local or remote repositories. Doing this promotes sharing and reuse of dependencies across projects.
