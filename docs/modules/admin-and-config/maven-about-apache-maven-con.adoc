= About Apache Maven

http://maven.apache.org/[Apache Maven] is a distributed build automation tool used in Java application development to build and manage software projects. Apart from building, publishing, and deploying capabilities, using Maven for your {PRODUCT_DM} and {PRODUCT_PAM} projects ensures the following:

* The build process is easy and a uniform build system is implemented across projects.
* All of the required JAR files for a project are made available at compile time.
* A proper project structure is configured.
* Dependencies and versions are well managed.
* No need for additional build processing, as Maven builds output into a number of predefined types, such as JAR and WAR
