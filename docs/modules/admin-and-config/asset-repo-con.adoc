The knowledge store is a centralized repository for your business knowledge. The knowledge store connects to the Git repository to store various knowledge assets and artifacts at a single location. {CENTRAL} provides a web front-end that enables you to view and update the stored content. You can access the content by using the Project Explorer from the unified environment of {PRODUCT}.

All business assets are stored in repositories.
