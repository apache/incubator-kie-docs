= Customizing {Central} splash help windows

You can customize the {CENTRAL} splash help windows to meet your specific business needs. Each splash page and its corresponding HTML file are located in the `_EAP_HOME_/standalone/deployments/business-central.war/plugins/` directory. The files contain information about the images and the text to be displayed. For example, the `authoring_perspective.splash.js` splash page points to the `authoring_perspective.splash.html` file, which contains the names, captions, and location of all the image files that appear in the splash help pop-up windows of the {Central} Authoring page.

.Procedure
. Start the EAP server, open {Central} in a web browser, and log in with your user credentials.
. Copy the new splash help images to the `_EAP_HOME_/standalone/deployments/business-central.war/images/` directory in your {PRODUCT} installation.
. Open the corresponding HTML file from the `plugins` directory in a text editor.
. Edit the HTML file to point to your new splash help image. For example, to change the first image that appears in the Authoring page splash help, edit the following `<img>` tag in the `authoring_perspective.splash.html` file to add your new image:
+
[source,html]
----
<img src="images/authoring_perspective1.png" alt="">
----
. To change the image caption that appears on the splash help, edit the `<h4>` and `<p>` tag contents in the `<div>` tag below the correspoding `<img>` tag:
+
[source,html]
----
<div class="carousel-caption">
  <h4>Authoring</h4>

  <p>Modularized and customizable workbench</p>
</div>
----
. Force a full reload of the login page, bypassing the cache, to view the changes. For example, in most Linux and Windows web browsers, press btn:[Ctrl]+btn:[F5].
