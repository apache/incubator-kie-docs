= About CDI

Apart from the API based approach, Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 7 also provides the Context and Dependency Injection (CDI) to build your custom applications. CDI is a collection of component management services for the Java EE platform that enables developers to use enterprise beans in web applications. The benefits of CDI include a simplified architecture and more resuable code.

The `jbpm-services-cdi` module provides CDI wrappers of https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_bpm_suite/6.4/html-single/development_guide/#sect_kie_services[Kie Services] that enable these services to be injected in any CDI bean.

[WARNING]
====
A workaround is needed on the {WEBLOGIC} for CDI to work.
