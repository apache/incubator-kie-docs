= Case definition and process definition

In {PRODUCT}, case management is an extension of BPM, and uses BPMN2 rather than CMMN for both modelling and execution. This means that there is no need to choose between BPM or case management; you can use both, taking advantage of your existing knowledge of BPM, while also benefiting from the dynamic capabilities of case management.

Case definition is the main entry point for the business use case, for example:

* insurance claim
* hardware order
* hospital patient treatment

It defines, but does not specifically require all of the following:

* activities
* stages
* milestones
* roles
* case file

Process definition is the supporting construct of the case, and can be invoked either as it has been defined in the case definition, or dynamically to bring in additional processing.
