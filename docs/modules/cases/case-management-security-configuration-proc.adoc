= Configuring security for case management

You can turn off case instance authorization by setting the following system property to `false`:

`org.jbpm.cases.auth.enabled`

This system property is just one of the security components for case instances. In addition, you can configure case operations at the execution server level using the `case-authorization.properties` file, available at the root of the class path of the execution server application (`kie-server.war/WEB-INF/classes`).

Using a simple configuration file for all possible case definitions encourages you to think about case management as domain-specific. `AuthorizationManager` for case security is pluggable, which allows you to include custom code for specific security handling.

You can restrict the following case instance operations to case roles:

* `CANCEL_CASE`
* `DESTROY_CASE`
* `REOPEN_CASE`
* `ADD_TASK_TO_CASE`
* `ADD_PROCESS_TO_CASE`
* `ADD_DATA`
* `REMOVE_DATA`
* `MODIFY_ROLE_ASSIGNMENT`
* `MODIFY_COMMENT`

.Prerequisite 
The {PRODUCT} {KIE_SERVER} is not running. 

.Procedure 
. Open `JBOSS_HOME/standalone/deployments/kie-server.war/WEB-INF/classes/case-authorization.properties` file in your preferred editor.
+
By default, the file contains the following operation restrictions:
+
[source]
----
CLOSE_CASE=owner,admin
CANCEL_CASE=owner,admin
DESTROY_CASE=owner,admin
REOPEN_CASE=owner,admin
----
. You can add or remove role permissions for these operations.
.. To remove permission for a role to perform an operation, remove it from the list of authorized roles for that operation in the `case-authorization.properties` file. For example, removing the `admin` role from the `CLOSE_CASE` operation restricts permission to close a case to the case owner for all cases.
.. To give a role permission to perform a case operation, add it to the list of authorized roles for that operation in the `case-authorization.properties` file. For example, to allow anyone with the `manager` role to perform a `CLOSE_CASE` operation, add it to the list of roles, separated by a comma:
+
`CLOSE_CASE=owner,admin,manager`

. To add role restrictions to other case operations listed in the file, remove the `#` from the line and list the role names in the following format:
+
`OPERATION=role1,role2,roleN`
+
Operations in the file that begin with `#` have restrictions ignored and can be performed by anyone involved in the case.
. When you have finished assigning role permissions, save and close the `case-authorization.properties` file.
. Start the execution server.
+
The case authorization settings apply to all cases on the execution server.
