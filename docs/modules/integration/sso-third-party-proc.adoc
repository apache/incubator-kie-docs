= Authenticating third-party clients through RH-SSO

To use the different remote services provided by {CENTRAL} or by {KIE_SERVER}, your client, such as curl, wget, web browser, or a custom REST client, must authenticate through the RH-SSO server and have a valid token to perform the requests. To use the remote services, the authenticated user must have the following roles:

* `rest-all` for using {CENTRAL} remote services.
* `kie-server` for using the {KIE_SERVER} remote services.

Use the RH-SSO Admin Console to create these roles and assign them to the users that will consume the remote services.

Your client can authenticate through RH-SSO using one of these options:

* Basic authentication, if it is supported by the client
* Token-based authentication
