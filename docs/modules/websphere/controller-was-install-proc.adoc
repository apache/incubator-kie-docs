= Installing and running the headless Process Automation Manager controller with {WEBSPHERE}

To use the {KIE_SERVER} REST API or Java Client API to interact with {KIE_SERVER}, install the headless Process Automation Manager controller with {WEBSPHERE}. The headless Process Automation Manager controller manages {KIE_SERVER} configuration in a centralized way so that you can use the controller to create and maintain containers and perform other server-level tasks.

[NOTE]
====
For optimal results, install {KIE_SERVER} and the headless Process Automation Manager controller on different servers in production environments. In development environments, you can install {KIE_SERVER} and the headless Process Automation Manager controller on the same server.
