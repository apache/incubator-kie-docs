= Building a custom {KIE_SERVER} image for an external database

If you want to use an external database server for a {KIE_SERVER} and this server is neither MySQL nor PostgreSQL, you must build a custom {KIE_SERVER} image with drivers for this server before deploying your environment.

You can use this build procedure to provide drivers for the following database servers:

* Microsoft SQL Server
* MariaDB
* IBM DB2
* Oracle Database
* Sybase

For the tested versions of the database servers, see https://access.redhat.com/articles/3405381#TestedConfigurations70[Red Hat Process Automation Manager 7 Supported Configurations].

The build procedure creates a custom image that extends the existing {KIE_SERVER} image. It pushes this custom image into a new `ImageStream` in the `openshift` namespace with the same version tag as the original image.

.Prerequisites
* You have logged on to your project in the OpenShift environment using the `oc` command as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* For IBM DB2, Oracle Database, or Sybase, you have downloaded the JDBC driver from the database server vendor.

.Procedure
. For IBM DB2, Oracle Database, or Sybase, provide the JDBC driver JAR in a local directory or on an HTTP server. Within the local directory or HTTP server, the following paths are expected:
+
** For IBM DB2, `<local_path_or_url>/com/ibm/db2/jcc/db2jcc4/10.5/db2jcc4-10.5.jar`
** For Oracle Database, `<local_path_or_url>/com/oracle/ojdbc7/12.1.0.1/ojdbc7-12.1.0.1.jar`
** For Sybase, `<local_path_or_url>/com/sysbase/jconn4/16.0_PL05/jconn4-16.0_PL05.jar`
+
Where `<local_path_or_url>` is the path to the local directory or the URL for the HTTP server where the driver is provided.
+
. To install the source code for the custom build, download the `{PRODUCT_FILE}-openshift-templates.zip` product deliverable file from the https://access.redhat.com/jbossnetwork/restricted/listSoftware.html[Software Downloads] page for {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}. Unzip the file and, using the command line, change to the `templates/contrib/jdbc` directory of the unzipped file.
. Change to the following subdirectory:
+
** For Microsoft SQL Server, `mssql-driver-image`
** For MariaDB, `mariadb-driver-image`
** For IBM DB2, `db2-driver-image`
** For Oracle Database, `oracle-driver-image`
** For Sybase, `sybase-driver-image`
+
. Run the following command:
+
--
** For Microsoft SQL Server or MariaDB:

[subs="verbatim,macros"]
----
../build.sh
----

** For IBM DB2, Oracle Database, or Sybase:

[subs="verbatim,macros"]
----
../build.sh --artifact-repo=<local_path_or_url>
----

Where `<local_path_or_url>` is the path to the local directory or the URL for the HTTP server where the driver is provided. For example:

----
../build.sh --artifact-repo=/home/builder/drivers
../build.sh --artifact-repo=http://nexus.example.com/nexus/content/groups/public
----

If you want to configure your OpenShift docker registry address in the process, add also the `--registry=<registry_name.domain_name:port>` parameter to your build command.

Examples:
----
../build.sh --registry=docker-registry.custom-domain:80

../build.sh --artifact-repo=/home/builder/drivers --registry=docker-registry.custom-domain:80
----
