= Modifying a template 
You might need to modify a template that deploys one or several {KIE_SERVER} pods. 

The required changes might include:
* Changing the database service that the {KIE_SERVER} uses. Every {KIE_SERVER} pod needs a database service. By default, most templates provide a separate MySQL pod for every {KIE_SERVER} replicated pod. You can choose a different database server for the database pods, change the number of database pods for your environment, or use a database service outside the deployment.
* Changing the number of {KIE_SERVER} replicated pods that are deployed.
