Guided Rules are business rules that you can create in a UI-based Guided Rules designer that leads you through the rule creation process. The rule designer provides fields and options for acceptable input based on the object model of the rule being edited. All data objects related to the rule must be in the same project package as the rule. Assets in the same package are imported by default. You can use the *Data Objects* tab of the rule designer to verify that all required data objects are listed or to import any other needed data objects.
