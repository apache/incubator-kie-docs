= Opening the Mortgage Process sample project

The *Mortgage Process* sample project consists of predefined data objects, guided decision tables, guided rules, forms, and a business process. Using the sample project provides a quick way to get acclimated with {PRODUCT}. In a real business scenario, you would create all of the assets by providing data that is specific to your business requirements.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The business process application example includes features that are Technology Preview only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs), might not be functionally complete, and are not recommended for production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.
For more information about Red Hat Technology Preview support, see https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/[Technology Preview Features Support Scope].
