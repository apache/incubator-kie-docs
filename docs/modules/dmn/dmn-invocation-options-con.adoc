= Options for invoking a DMN model

To invoke a decision that is defined in a DMN file, you must first package the file in a KIE container. A specific version of knowledge components comes in a knowledge JAR (KJAR), which you can either deploy to {KIE_SERVER} for remote access, or manipulate directly as a dependency of the calling application. Covering all options for creating and deploying these knowledge packages is outside the scope of this document, although most are similar to other knowledge assets (for example, a Drools rule file or jBPM process definition). After you have packaged or deployed the decision, you have several options for invoking it.
