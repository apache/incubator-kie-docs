= Adding dynamic tasks and processes to a case using the API


You can add dynamic tasks and processes to a case during run time to address unforeseen changes that can occur during the lifecycle of a case. Dynamic activities are not defined in the case definition and therefore they cannot be signaled the way that a defined ad hoc task or process can.

You can add the following dynamic activities to a case:

* User tasks
* Service tasks (any type that is implemented as a work item)
* Reusable subprocesses 

Dynamic user and service tasks are added to a case instance and immediately executed. Depending on the nature of a dynamic task, it might start and wait for completion (user task) or directly complete after execution (service task). For dynamic subprocesses, the process engine requires a KJAR containing the process definition for that dynamic process to locate the process by its ID and execute it. This subprocess belongs to the case and has access to all of the data in the case file. 

You can use the Swagger REST API application to create dynamic tasks and subprocesses.

.Prerequisite 
You are logged in to {CENTRAL} and a case instance has been started using the Showcase application. For more information about using Showcase, see 
ifeval::["{context}" == "case-management-design"]
xref:case-management-showcase-application-con-case-management-design[Case management Showcase application].

+
`http://localhost:8080/kie-server/docs`
. Open the list of available endpoints under *Case instances :: Case Management*.
. Locate the `POST` method endpoints for creating dynamic activities.
