= Creating case roles

You can create and define case roles in the case definition when designing the case in the process designer. Case roles are configured on the case definition level to keep them separate from the actors involved in handling the case instance. Roles can be assigned to user tasks or used as contact references throughout the case lifecycle, but they are not defined in the case as a specific user or group of users. 

Case instances include the individuals that are actually handling the case work and it is recommended that roles are assigned when starting a new case instance. In order to keep cases flexible, case role assignment can be modified during case run time, although doing so will have no effect on tasks already created based on the previous role assignment. The actor assigned to a role is flexible but the role itself remains the same for each case. 

.Prerequisite 
* You have created a case project in {CENTRAL} and added a case definition asset. 
* The case definition asset is open in the process designer.

.Procedure 
. To define the roles involved in the case, click image:3897.png[] to open the *Properties* menu on the right side of the designer and open the *Editor for Case Roles*. 
. Click *Add Case Role* to add a case roles.

The case role requires a name for the role and a case cardinality. Case cardinality is the number of actors that can be assigned to the role in any case instance. For example, the IT Orders sample case management project includes the following roles:

In this example, there can only be one actor (a user or a group) assigned as the case `owner` and only one actor assigned to the `manager` role. The `supplier` role can have two actors assigned. Depending on the case, there can be any number of actors assigned a particular role based on the configured case cardinality of the role.
