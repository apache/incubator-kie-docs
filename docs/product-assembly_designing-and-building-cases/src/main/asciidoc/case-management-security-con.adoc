= Case management security

Cases are configured at the case definition level with case roles. These are generic participants that are involved in case handling. These roles can be assigned to user tasks or used as contact references. Roles are not hard-coded to specific users or groups to keep the case definition independent of the actual actors involved in any given case instance. You can modify case role assignments at any time as long as case instance is active, though modifying a role assignment does not affect tasks already created based on the previous role assignment.

Case instance security is enabled by default. The case definition prevents case data from being accessed by users who do not belong to the case. Unless a user has a case role assignment (either assigned as user or a group member) then they are not able to access the case instance.

Case security is one of the reasons why it is recommended that you assign case roles when starting a case instance, as this will prevent tasks being assigned to users who should not have access to the case.
