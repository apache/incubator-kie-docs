If you use {PRODUCT_OLD} version 6.4 and install {PRODUCT} version {PRODUCT_VERSION}, you need to migrate your existing projects to the new product.

You can move the applications (now called _decision services_) that you developed using the Business Central workbench to the new equivalent, {CENTRAL}. You do not need to change the underlying code manually to complete this migration.

Decision services that you developed in Java code (for example, in Eclipse) require modification for {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}. You must update the dependencies in the `pom.xml` file for each project and rebuild the project. Some changes in the new version might cause known build errors; in this case, you must modify the code.

To migrate your Java client applications, you also must update the dependencies in the `pom.xml` file for each project. If your application uses embedded BRMS engines (Drools, OptaPlanner), this change also updates the engines. If the application calls the {KIE_SERVER}, the API client library is updated.

If your client application is not developed with the Java client library and uses the REST API to interact with the KIE server ({KIE_SERVER}), you might need to modify it to adapt to a small incompatible API change.

You can replace your KIE servers with new {KIE_SERVERS} simply by stopping the old servers and starting the new ones on the same hosts. You can use {KIE_SERVER} {PRODUCT_VERSION} to run KJAR files created in BRMS 6.4. However, for optimal performance, migrate your projects to {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} and rebuild them.

If you use {PRODUCT_OLD} version 6.4 and install {PRODUCT} version {PRODUCT_VERSION}, you need to migrate the applications that you created (now called _decision services_) and possibly your server environment to the new product. Red Hat provides migration tools wherever possible to facilitate migration, but in some cases, manual migration or asset re-creation is required.

The following are the main areas of migration to consider when migrating to {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}:

* Execution server migration: In {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}, {CENTRAL} no longer has execution server capabilities nor any REST or JMS endpoints. Instead, the {KIE_SERVER} performs all execution and runtime functions and {CENTRAL} is used for application development and management only. As a result of this change, the {CENTRAL} environment in {PRODUCT_OLD} must be migrated to the new {CENTRAL} and {KIE_SERVER} environments in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}. Project data must be migrated in the process, either manually or with the Red Hat project migration tool provided with this release. 

* {CENTRAL} project migration: Decision services that you created in {CENTRAL} with {PRODUCT_OLD} 6.4 need to be migrated using a Red Hat project migration tool to accommodate a new data structure. Project data is restructured in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} so that each Space (previously Organization Unit) contains repositories that correspond to individual projects, instead of multiple projects in a single repository as in {PRODUCT_OLD} 6.4. This improved structure means that users do not have to create and manage repositories and can focus more on developing decision services. If you are unable to use the project migration tool, you can migrate each project manually.

* Asset migration: Process and forms?

* Java project migration: Decision services that you developed in Java code (for example, in Eclipse) require modification for {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}. You must update the dependencies in the `pom.xml` file for each project and rebuild the project. Some changes in the new version might cause known build errors; in this case, you must modify the code.

To migrate your Java client applications, you also must update the dependencies in the `pom.xml` file for each project. If your application uses embedded {PRODUCT_OLD} engines (such as Drools and OptaPlanner), this change also updates the engines.

If your client application is not developed with the Java client library and uses the REST API to interact with the KIE server ({KIE_SERVER}), you might need to modify it to adapt to a small incompatible API change.

* {KIE_SERVER} upgrade: If you are not using {CENTRAL} in {PRODUCT_OLD}, you can replace your KIE servers with new {KIE_SERVERS} by stopping the old servers and starting the new ones on the same hosts. You can use {KIE_SERVER} {PRODUCT_VERSION} to run KJAR files created in {PRODUCT_OLD} 6.4. However, for optimal performance, migrate your projects to {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} and rebuild them.

IMPORTANT: If you are using a version of BRMS older than 6.4, migrate your projects to version 6.4 before migrating to 7.0. See the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_bpm_suite/6.4/html-single/migration_guide/index[Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.4 Migration Guide]
