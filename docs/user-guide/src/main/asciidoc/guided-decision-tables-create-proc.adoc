= Creating Web-Based Guided Decision Tables

You can use guided decision tables to define rule attributes, meta-data, conditions, and actions in a tabular format that can be added to your business rules project.

.Procedure
. Go to *Project Authoring* -> *Assets* -> *Create Asset* -> *Guided Decision Table*.
. Enter an informative *Guided Decision Table Name* and select the appropriate *Package*.
. Select *Use Wizard* to finish setting up the table in the Wizard, or leave this option unselected to finish creating the table and specify remaining configurations in the Guided Decision Table Editor.
+
The Wizard helps you define your imports, facts, patterns, and columns, but not the rows. Rows are added in the Guided Decision Table Editor after initial table setup.
+
. Select the hit policy that you want your rows of rules in the table to conform to. For details, see <<_hit_policies_con>>.
. Specify whether you want the *Extended entry* or *Limited entry* table. For details, see <<_types_of_decision_table>>.
