= Web-Based Guided Decision Tables

The web-based Guided Decision Table feature works similarly to the Guided Editor by outlining available facts and fields to guide the creation of a decision table.

Rule attributes, meta-data, conditions, and actions can be defined in a tabular format, thus facilitating rapid entry of large sets of related rules.
Web-based decision table rules are compiled into DRL like all other rule assets.
