.Prerequisite
The team and project for the guided rules have been created in {CENTRAL}. Each asset is associated with a project assigned to a team. For details, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_decision_manager/7.0/html-single/getting_started_with_decision_services/[_{GETTING_STARTED_DECISION_SERVICE}_].
