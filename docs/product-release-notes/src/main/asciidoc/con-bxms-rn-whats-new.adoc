= What's New

This section highlights new features in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} Limited Availability.

== Business Central

=== Improved Navigation

.Navigation between views
You can now navigate as follows:

* From a process instance to the associated jobs
* From a job to the associated process instance
* From a process instance to the associated tasks

.Business Central Home page
The Business Central Home page has been redesigned for easier navigation. For more information, see the "Business Central" chapter of the _{PRODUCT} User Guide_.

=== Guided Decision Table
* Guided Decision Table has a new wizard for creating and editing columns.
* Hit policies are now available. Hit policies determine the order in which rules (rows) in a guided decision table are applied.
* New support to display multiple linked guided decision tables in the Guided Decision Table Editor has been added.

=== Project metrics dashboard
A new dashboard is now available for every project listed in the authoring library. 

=== Teams metrics dashboard
A  new dashboard has been added to the *Teams* perspective. 

===Â Improved process status reporting
The process status now reports when a process has errors associated with it.

=== New columns available on process instances, tasks, and jobs
The following columns have been added to the corresponding perspectives:

* Process instance list perspective: Last update and correlation key.
* Task list: Last update, correlation key (of the associated process instance ID), process instance description (of the associated process instance).
* Jobs perspective: Name of the associated process (if any), ID of the associated process instance (if any), Description of the associated process instance (if any).

=== Quick search filters for runtime data
To enable you to quickly find data related to process instances, jobs, tasks, and errors, a new set of predefined filters has been introduced into the related views. 

=== New Task Administration perspective and actions
The former task list perspective has been divided into the Tasks List and Task Administration perspectives.

=== Improved validation in deployment descriptor editor

The deployment descriptor editor in Business Central has been improved to validate the content of entered data for the following:

* Work item handlers
* Event listeners
* Marshalling strategies
* Globals
* Environment entries
* Configuration

Validation is performed automatically when a build is invoked or manually when a user clicks *Validate*.

=== Error Handling
.New error handling
The system now detects and stores execution errors such as exceptions while running a process instance or a job after the maximum number of retries has been exceeded. 

.New execution errors view
A new view to explore and acknowledge the new generated execution error has been added.

.Configurable error handling
If an error occurs, an event is generated that contains the following data:

--

== Process Engine
=== Process and task administration API

A process administration API and task administration API have been introduced to simplify some of the more complex administrator use cases.

=== Advanced task routing
When tasks are assigned to a group of users, you can use pluggable task assignment strategies to automatically assign tasks to a suitable individual immediately. This enables more efficient task allocation, based on all properties associated with the task (for example potential owners and task priority but also task data that includes information such as geography, required skills, and so forth). You can use business rules to define the assignment logic, making it easy to customize this to your needs.

=== Process execution server
The process execution server (also known as kie-server) has been extended to support core engine features and offers a remote API for these operations. 

=== Separate Business Central from execution server
Business Central now delegates all of its requests to the execution server as well. The main advantage is that Business Central can now be used to monitor any set of execution servers. By linking the execution server to Business Central, the process and task monitoring UIs in Business Central can now connect to this execution server and show all relevant information. When multiple independent execution servers are used, you can either connect to a specific one or use the smart router to aggregate information across multiple servers. 

=== Smart router
The smart router (also known as kie-server-router) can be used as a proxy to help manage multiple independent process execution servers.

=== Aliases
You can now use aliases instead of container IDs in the remote REST APIs of the execution server.
 
=== Business Central monitoring web application
A new distribution `war` file has been added in this release. The goal is for the KIE Monitoring Web Application to be used along with Decision Server instances, managing all runtime capabilities. This includes managing containers, process instances, tasks, dashboards, and more. As opposed to the standard Business Central distribution, no authoring capabilities are offered.
 
=== Work Item archetype

To help users build custom service tasks (work items), {PRODUCT} comes with the Work Item archetype that generates the majority of items required to build a custom service task. 

=== KIE Server Maven plugins
KIE Server has been enhanced with additional Maven plugins that enable interaction with the KIE Server and KIE Controller REST API directly from within a build. This facilitates easier integration with CI/CD pipelines when building KJars so they can be directly deployed to the execution environment (both managed and unmanaged KIE Servers).

== Business Resource Planner
* Multi-threaded partitioned search is available. Business Resource Planner now has out-of-the box support for solving a single dataset by partitioning across multiple threads. This enhancement makes use of multiple CPU cores for a single problem. Partitioned search can implement geo-fencing for Vehicle Routing use cases. 
* The Solution interface is deprecated. Your solution class requires only the `@PlanningSolution` annotation.
* You no longer need to define the score type in the solver configuration. Business Resource Planner now picks it up automatically from the domain model.
* The Business Resource Planner Solver editor screen now supports adding all termination types, including composite termination. The phase configuration section enables you to tweak Construction Heuristic settings and select Local Search algorithm to optimize your planning problem.
* Examples are now part of Business Central and they work offline as well. Leverage tag-based filtering to quickly access projects from the field you are interested in.
* The Business Resource Planner domain editor can now specify a planning entity difficulty. Navigate through the object hierarchy and define the sorting attributes. Several construction heuristic algorithms use this information to construct a better initial solution.
* The Business Resource Planner execution server now supports real-time planning.
