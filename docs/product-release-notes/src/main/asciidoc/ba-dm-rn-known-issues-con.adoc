// Known issue in DM 7.0.2, but don't want to broadcast and will fix in 7.0.2 (Stetson, 2 Jul 2018)
.The `{URL_COMPONENT_CENTRAL}` image Git repository is inaccessible to {PRODUCT} on OpenShift [https://issues.jboss.org/browse/RHDM-536[RHDM-536]]

{Central} enables assets to be pulled from and pushed to its internal repository through Git over the SSH protocol. In the OpenShift environment, this is exposed on port `8001`, but this port is not mapped and exposed through a service. As a result of this issue, the image repository may be inaccessible and CI/CD use cases may be impeded.

Workaround: None
