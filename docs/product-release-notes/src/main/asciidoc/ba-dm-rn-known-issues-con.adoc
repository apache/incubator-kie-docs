.Process Designer morphing issues [https://issues.jboss.org/browse/RHPAM-430[RHPAM-430]]

* It is possible to morph from a sub-process into a certain task type, but it is not possible to morph back to a sub-process. You should be able to:
**Morph between task types and re-usable subprocesses
**Morph between embedded and ad-hoc subprocesses
* When morphing an embedded sub-process into a task an exception appears and the diagram is not updated
* If you morph the sub-process with content, the content is hidden after morphing. You must reopen the process to see the content again.

.Process Designer editors are very slow with Google Chrome on Linux [https://issues.jboss.org/browse/RHPAM-922[RHPAM-922]]

Steps to reproduce:
Open three Process Designer editors in Google Chrome on Linux.

Expected result: All instances of Process Designer perform at the same level, regardless of the number of editors open.

Actual result: The first two editors that were opened perform as usual, but the third and all subsequent editor are very slow, even if you will close first two editors.
