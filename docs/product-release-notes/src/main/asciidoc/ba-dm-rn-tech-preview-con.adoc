[IMPORTANT]
====
These features are for Technology Preview only. Technology Preview features
are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs), might
not be functionally complete, and Red Hat does not recommend to use them for
production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features,
enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the
development process.
For more information on Red Hat Technology Preview features support scope,

== Technical Preview experimental features
The following Technology Preview features are experimental and may require additional API changes:

* Multithreaded Execution - Solves a single data set by partitioning across multiple threads. It is turned off by default and can be enabled either with a KieBaseConfiguration option or with a system property as explained in http://docs.jboss.org/drools/release/7.5.0.Final/drools-docs/html_single/#_multithreaded_rule_engine[Drools Documentation]
* Rule Units - Rule Units represent a declarative approach to partitioning a rule set in to smaller units, binding different data sources to those units, and the execution of the individual unit. A Rule Unit is comprised of data sources, global variables, and rules.

.Enabling Application Lifecycle Automation and Provisioning User Interface
{PRODUCT} settings allow you to enable the Application Lifecycle Automation and Provisioning User Interface features.

. Go to *Settings* -> *Roles* -> *admin*.
. Expand *Pages* and click the *Read* field to enable *Deployments*.

.Enabling the Content Management System (CMS) Perspective
{PRODUCT} settings allow you to enable the CMS Perspective.

. Go to *Settings* -> *Roles* -> *admin*.
. Expand *Pages* and click the *Read* field to enable *Page Authoring*.

.Enabling Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML)
This feature uses a single configuration option, org.drools.compiler.compiler.PMMLCompiler. The valid values for this configuration option are:

* org.kie.pmml.pmml_4_2.PMML4Compiler - This value should be used for the majority of cases where PMML support is desired.
* org.drools.pmml.pmml_4_2.PMML4Compiler - This value provides backwards compatibility, and should only be used in cases where there is a reliance on the older drools-pmml and drools-scorecards modules.
