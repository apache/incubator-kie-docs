== Technical preview experimental features
The following Technology Preview features are experimental and may require additional API changes:

* Multithreaded Execution - Solves a single data set by partitioning across multiple threads. It is turned off by default and can be enabled either with a KieBaseConfiguration option or with a system property as explained here http://docs.jboss.org/drools/release/7.5.0.Final/drools-docs/html_single/#_multithreaded_rule_engine
* Rule Units - Rule Units represent a declarative approach to partitioning a rule set in to smaller units, binding different data sources to those units, and the execution of the individual unit. A Rule Unit is comprised of data sources, global variables, and rules.

.Enabling Application Lifecycle Automation and Provisioning User Interface
{PRODUCT} settings allow you to enable the Application Lifecycle Automation and Provisioning User Interface features.

. Go to *Settings* -> *Roles* -> *admin*.
. Expand *Pages* and click the *Read* field to enable *Deployments*.

.Enabling the Content Management System (CMS) Perspective
{PRODUCT} settings allow you to enable the CMS Perspective.

.Enabling Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML)
This feature uses a single configuration option, org.drools.compiler.compiler.PMMLCompiler. The valid values for this configuration option are:

* org.kie.pmml.pmml_4_2.PMML4Compiler - This value should be used for the majority of cases where PMML support is desired.
* org.drools.pmml.pmml_4_2.PMML4Compiler - This value provides backwards compatibility, and should only be used in cases where there is a reliance on the older drools-pmml and drools-scorecards modules.
