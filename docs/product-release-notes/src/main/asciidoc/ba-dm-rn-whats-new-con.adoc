= What's New

This section highlights new features in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} Limited Availability.

== Business Central
 
=== Improved Navigation

.Navigation between views
You can now navigate as follows:

* From a process instance to the associated jobs
* From a job to the associated process instance
* From a process instance to the associated tasks

.Business Central Home page
The Business Central Home page has been redesigned for easier navigation. For more information, see the "Business Central" chapter of the _{PRODUCT} User Guide_.

=== Guided Decision Table
* Guided Decision Table has a new wizard for creating and editing columns.
* Hit policies are now available. Hit policies determine the order in which rules (rows) in a guided decision table are applied.
* New support to display multiple linked guided decision tables in the Guided Decision Table Editor has been added.

=== Projects Metrics dashboard
A new dashboard is available for every project listed in the Projects perspective. The Projects Metrics dashboard displays all of your project contribution metrics in one place. This new dashboard replaces the Contributors page, which was part of the Authoring group. For more information, see the "Projects Metrics dashboard" section of the _{PRODUCT} User Guide_.

=== Team Metrics dashboard
The Team Metrics dashboard shows all of the project metrics for a team in a single page. This new dashboard replaces the older Contributors page, which was part of the Authoring group. For more information, see the "Team Metrics dashboard" section of the _{PRODUCT} User Guide_.

=== New columns available on process instances, tasks, and jobs
The following columns have been added to the corresponding perspectives:

* Process instance list perspective: Last update and correlation key.
* Task list: Last update, correlation key (of the associated process instance ID), process instance description (of the associated process instance).
* Jobs perspective: Name of the associated process (if any), ID of the associated process instance (if any), Description of the associated process instance (if any).

=== Advanced search filter
You can now search for specific data by using the *Search* tab on the Jobs, Process Instances, Task Administration, and Execution Errors perspectives. For information about the new search feature, see the "Using the advanced search filter pages" section of the _{PRODUCT} {RELEASE} User Guide_.

=== New Task List and Task Administration perspectives
The former Task List perspective has been divided into the Task List and Task Administration perspectives. The Task List perspective is used by task operators to work with their assigned (or potentially assigned) tasks. The Task Administration perspective is used by administrators to manage tasks assigned to other users. This perspective is only available for users with admin or process-admin roles. It is similar to the Admin filter tab on the former Task List perspective.

=== Improved validation in deployment descriptor editor

The deployment descriptor editor in Business Central has been improved to validate data entered for the following:

* Work item handlers
* Event listeners
* Marshalling strategies
* Globals
* Environment entries
* Configuration

The deployment descriptor editor performs the validation when a build is invoked or manually when a user clicks *Validate*.

=== Error Handling
While running a process instance or a job, the system now detects and stores execution errors such as exceptions after the maximum number of retries has been exceeded. If an error occurs, the system generates an event that contains the following data:

--
[cols="1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Data
| Fields

.3+| Process model
| processModelID
| processModelVersion
| processModelName

.2+| Process instance that has failed
| processInstanceID
| customProcessID

.5+| Activity that has failed
| activityID
| activityName
| activityType
| iteration
| status

.2+| Error data
| errorMessage: Message with the error that has occurred.
| errorStack: Stack with error detail.
|===
--

The process instance list includes a new column that displays the number of errors per process instance which are not marked as acknowledged. When you select the column, a window appears which enables you to navigate to the new Error perspective.

The Execution Errors perspective lists any errors that occur during process instances or executor service jobs on a Decision Server. Use this perspective to help troubleshoot issues. It is visible to users with the admin and process-admin roles.


== Process Engine

=== Process API and task administration API
A process administration API and task administration API have been introduced to simplify some of the more complex administrator use cases.
You can use the process administration API to do the following:

* Retrieve all process definition nodes
* Cancel node instances
* Retrigger node instances
* Update the timer (absolute or relative)
* List timer instances
* Trigger nodes

You can use the task administration API to do the following:

* Add and remove potential owners and excluded owners and business administrators
* Add and remove task inputs and outputs
* List, create, and cancel escalations and notifications

=== Advanced task routing
When tasks are assigned to a group of users, you can use pluggable task assignment strategies to automatically assign tasks to a suitable individual immediately. This enables more efficient task allocation, based on all properties associated with the task. For example, potential owners and task priority but also task data that includes information such as geography, required skills, and so on. You can use business rules to define the assignment logic, making it easy to customize this to your needs.

=== Process execution server
The process execution server (also known as kie-server) has been extended to support core engine features and offers a remote API for these operations. In addition the following architectural changes were introduced.

==== Separate Business Central from execution server
Business Central now delegates all of its requests to the execution server. The main advantage is that Business Central can now be used to monitor any set of execution servers. By linking the execution server to Business Central, the process and task monitoring UIs in Business Central can now connect to this execution server and show all relevant information. When multiple independent execution servers are used, you can either connect to a specific one or use the smart router to aggregate information across multiple servers. 

==== Smart router
The smart router (also known as kie-server-router) can be used as a proxy to help manage multiple independent process execution servers.

==== Aliases
You can now use aliases instead of container IDs in the remote REST APIs of the execution server. For more information, see the "Editing container aliases through Business Central" section of the _{PRODUCT} User Guide_.
 
=== Business Central Monitoring web application
This release includes a new distribution `war` file that enables you to build custom cloud images. Use the Business Central Monitoring web application with Decision Server instances to manage containers, process instances, tasks, dashboards, and other runtime capabilities in the cloud. Unlike the standard Business Central distribution, no authoring capabilities are available.

NOTE:
For on-premise deployments, use the standard Business Central `war` file.
 
=== Work Item archetype

To help users build custom service tasks (work items), {PRODUCT} comes with the Work Item archetype that generates the majority of items required to build a custom service task.  The archetype includes the following:

* A Work Item Definition (WID) file
* The Work Item Handler implementation class
* The Work Item Handler test class

The Maven assembly (zip) packages everything at build time so it can be consumed by the Service Repository and therefore be used from within the Web Designer.

=== KIE Server Maven plugins
KIE Server has been enhanced with additional Maven plugins that enable interaction with the KIE Server and KIE Controller REST API directly from within a build. This interaction facilitates easier integration with CI/CD pipelines when building KJars so they can be directly deployed to the execution environment (both managed and unmanaged KIE Servers).

== Business Resource Planner
* Multi-threaded partitioned search is available. Business Resource Planner now has out-of-the box support for solving a single data set by partitioning across multiple threads. This enhancement makes use of multiple CPU cores for a single problem. Partitioned search can implement geo-fencing for Vehicle Routing use cases. 
* The Solution interface is deprecated. Your solution class requires only the `@PlanningSolution` annotation.
* You no longer need to define the score type in the solver configuration. Business Resource Planner now determines it automatically from the domain model.
* The Business Resource Planner Solver editor screen now supports adding all termination types, including composite termination. The phase configuration section enables you to tweak Construction Heuristic settings and select the local search algorithm to optimize your planning problem.
* Examples are now part of Business Central and they work offline as well. Leverage tag-based filtering to quickly access projects from the field you are interested in.
* The Business Resource Planner domain editor can now specify a planning entity difficulty. Navigate through the object hierarchy and define the sorting attributes. Several construction heuristic algorithms use this information to construct a better initial solution.
* The Business Resource Planner execution server now supports real-time planning.
