= What's new

This section highlights new features in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}.

== {PRODUCT}

=== Improved navigation

.{PRODUCT} Home page
The {PRODUCT} Home page has been redesigned for easier navigation.

=== Guided Decision Table
* Guided Decision Table has a new wizard for creating and editing columns.
* Hit policies are now available. Hit policies determine the order in which rules (rows) in a guided decision table are applied.
* New support to display multiple linked guided decision tables in the Guided Decision Table Editor has been added.

=== Projects Metrics dashboard
A new dashboard is available for every project listed in the Projects perspective. The Projects Metrics dashboard displays all of your project contribution metrics in one place. This new dashboard replaces the Contributors page, which was part of the Authoring group.

=== Team Metrics dashboard
The Team Metrics dashboard shows all of the project metrics for a team in a single page. This new dashboard replaces the older Contributors page, which was part of the Authoring group.

=== {KIE_SERVER}
The {KIE_SERVER} (also known as kie-server) has been extended to support core engine features and offers a remote API for these operations. In addition the following architectural changes were introduced.

==== Separate {PRODUCT} from execution server
{PRODUCT} now delegates all of its requests to the execution server. The main advantage is that {PRODUCT} can now be used to monitor any set of execution servers.

==== Smart router
The smart router (also known as kie-server-router) can be used as a proxy to help manage multiple independent process execution servers.

==== Aliases
You can now use aliases instead of container IDs in the remote REST APIs of the execution server.

=== {PRODUCT} Monitoring web application
This release includes a new distribution `war` file that enables you to build custom cloud images. Use the {PRODUCT} Monitoring web application with {KIE_SERVER} instances to manage containers, process instances, tasks, dashboards, and other runtime capabilities in the cloud. Unlike the standard {PRODUCT} distribution, no authoring capabilities are available.

[NOTE]
====
For on-premise deployments, use the standard {PRODUCT} `war` file.

=== KIE Server Maven plugins
KIE Server has been enhanced with additional Maven plugins that enable interaction with the KIE Server and KIE Controller REST API directly from within a build. This interaction facilitates easier integration with CI/CD pipelines when building KJars so they can be directly deployed to the execution environment (both managed and unmanaged KIE Servers).

== Business Optimizer
* Multi-threaded partitioned search is available. Business Optimizer now has out-of-the box support for solving a single data set by partitioning across multiple threads. This enhancement makes use of multiple CPU cores for a single problem. Partitioned search can implement geo-fencing for Vehicle Routing use cases.
* The Solution interface is deprecated. Your solution class requires only the `@PlanningSolution` annotation.
* You no longer need to define the score type in the solver configuration. Business Optimizer now determines it automatically from the domain model.
* The Business Optimizer editor screen now supports adding all termination types, including composite termination. The phase configuration section enables you to tweak Construction Heuristic settings and select the local search algorithm to optimize your planning problem.

* The Business Optimizer domain editor can now specify a planning entity difficulty. Navigate through the object hierarchy and define the sorting attributes. Several construction heuristic algorithms use this information to construct a better initial solution.
* The Business Optimizer execution server now supports real-time planning.

== New component names
The following components have been renamed in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}:

== Business Application templates

=== Templates
Business application templates are provided with {PRODUCT} and can be modified to meet your business requirements. {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} contains the *Employee Roster* template.

=== Template delivery
Templates are downloaded from the Customer Portal and are included in the {PRODUCT} distribution.

=== Template support

Business application templates are not an integral part of {PRODUCT} and are intended for development purposes of customer solutions. Templates are provided to encourage customers to adopt and modify them to work for their specific needs.
The content of the template itself does not carry product-specific Service Level Agreements (SLAs). We encourage you to report issues, request for enhancements, and any other feedback for consideration in template updates.

Red Hat Support will provide guidance on the use of this template on a commercially reasonable basis for its intended use, excluding the provided example UI code provided within.

[NOTE]
====
https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/production/soc[Production support] is limited to {PRODUCT} distribution.
