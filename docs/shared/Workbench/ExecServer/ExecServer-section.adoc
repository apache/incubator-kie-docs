== Server Templates


Server templates are used to define a common configuration that can be used for multiple server, thus the name: Template.

Server Templates can be created directly from the management UI or it's automatically create when a server connects to controller and there isn't a template definition for that remote server.
Server templates may have one or more capabilities, such capabilities can't be modified, if you need modify the capabilities you'll have to create a new template.
Here is the list of current capabilities: 

* Rule (Drools) 
* Process (jBPM) 
* Planning (Optaplanner) 


[NOTE]
====
For Planner capability it's mandatory to enable Rule's capability too.
====


In order to create a new Server Template you have to click at New Server Template button and follow the wizard.
It's also possible to create a container during Wizard, but for now let's limit to just the template. 

.New Server Template Wizard

Once created you'll get the new Template listed on the left hand side, with the new Server Template highlighted.
On the right hand side you get the 2nd level navigation that lists Containers and Remote Servers that are related to selected Server Template.

On top of the navigation is also possible to delete the current Server Template or create a copy of it.

== Container


A Container is a KIE Container configuration of the Server Template.
Click the Add Container button to create a new container for the current Server Template. 

The search area can help users find an specific KJARs that they are looking for.

For Server Templates that have Process capabilities enabled, the Wizard has a 2nd optional step where users can configure some process related behaviors. 

.Process Configuration
image::shared/Workbench/ExecServer/ProcessConfigNewContainerWizard.png[align="center"]

*Kie Base Name* determines which Kie Base of the deployed artifact will be used.

*Kie Session Name* determines which Kie Session of the selected Kie Base will be used.

[NOTE]
====
Please notice that configurations on this tab takes effect only if the deployed project contains some business processeses. It is not enough if the server template has the extension for processes enabled.
====


Once created the new Container will be displayed on the containers list just above the list of remote servers.
Just after created a container is by default Stopped which is the only state that allows users to remove it. 

.Container

A Container has the following tabs available for management and/or configuration: 

* Status 
* Version Configuration 
* Process Configuration 


Status tab lists all the Remote Servers that are running the active Container.
Each Remote Server is rendered as a Card, which displays to users status and endpoint. 

[NOTE]
====
Only started Containers are deployed to remote servers.

Version Configuration tab allow users change the current version of the Container.
User's can upgrade manually to a specific version using the "Upgrade" button, or enable/disable the Scanner.
It's also possible to execute a Scan Now operation, that will scan for new versions only once.

Process Configuration is the same form that is displayed during New Container Wizard for Template Servers that have Process Capability.
If Template Server doesn't have such capability, the action buttons will be disabled.
