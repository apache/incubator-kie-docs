== Authoring - Imports of Examples

Prior to 7.x the Workbench used to install pre-defined examples at startup. 

Version 7.x brings the ability to import examples from git repositories.
The Authoring Perspective contains a menu item for 'Examples' clicking this launches a Wizard to guide you through the import.

== Authoring - Pop-ups improvements

All system pop-ups had their UX improved.

The "comment" field is hidden by default.

Now, the destination package can be selected when a project file is copied from any package.

== Guided Rule Editor : Support formulae in composite field constraints

Composite field constraints now support use of formulae.

When adding constraints to a Pattern the "Multiple Field Constraint" selection ("All of (and)" and "Any of (or)") supports use of formulae in addition to expressions.

== Guided Decision Table Editor : New editor

The Guided Decision Table Editor has been extensively rewritten to support editing of multiple tables in the same editor. Tables that share an association are visibly linked making it easier to visualise relationships. Associations are infered from Actions that create or update a Fact consumed by the Conditions of another table.

Highlights include:-

- A new look and feel
- Resizable columns
- Reordering of columns by dragging and dropping "in table"
- Reordering of rows by dragging and dropping "in table"
- Repositioning of tables with drag and drop
- Panning of view to scroll content
- Zoomable view, so you can zoom "out" to see more content at once
- File locks and Version History per Decision Table

== Guided Decision Table Editor : Verification and Validation

=== System Property
It is possible to disable the Verification & Validation with the system property **``**org.kie.verification.disable-dtable-realtime-verification**``**. This can be useful for large decision tables or if the users want to ignore V&V.

=== Range Checks

The verification takes the first steps towards helping you to make complete decision tables. In the next release we add the support for checking if all the ranges are covered for boolean, numeric and date values. This means if your table has a check for if an Application is approved the verification report will remind you to make sure you also handle situations where the Application was not approved.

=== Unique Single Hit

In the past verification and validation has raised an issue if rows subsume each other. If a row subsumes another, then the conditions can be satisfied with the same set of facts. Meaning two rows from the same table can fire at the same time. In some cases subsumption does not matter, but in other cases you want to have a table where only one rule fires at the time. The table is then a single hit decision table. To help the making of single hit tables where only one row can fire, the verification keeps an eye on the conditions. Reporting situations when single hit is broken.

== Security Management

The User and Group management perspectives released in version 6.4 have been unified into a single perspective which delivers a shared view for managing both users and groups as well as the permissions granted to any of the application roles.

This very new perspective is placed under the _Home_ section in the top menu bar.

The next screenshot shows how this new perspective looks:

.Security Management Home

A tabbed pane is shown on the left, allowing the User to select the _Roles_, _Groups_ or _Users_ tab. After clicking on a Role (or Group)
a detailed screen is displayed allowing the user to configure some security settings.

* *Home Perspective*: The target perspective where the user is directed after login, which makes it possible to have different home pages per role/group.

* *Priority*: Used to determine what settings (home perspective, permissions, ...) have precedence for those users with more than one role or group assigned.

* *Permissions*: A full ACL (_Access Control List_) editor for grant/deny permissions over the different resources available in the platform like _Perspectives_,
_Organizational Units_, _Repositories_ or _Projects_. Global permissions on top of any of those resource types can be ovewritten by means of adding individual exceptions
which makes it possible to implement both the _grant all deny a few_ or the _deny all grant a few_ strategies.
