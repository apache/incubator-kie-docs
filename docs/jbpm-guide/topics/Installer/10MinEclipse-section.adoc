The http://people.redhat.com/kverlaen/jbpm6F-installer-eclipse.swf[following
    screencast] gives an overview of how to use the Eclipse tooling.
It shows you: 

* How to import and execute the evaluation sample project 
+
** Import the evaluation project (included in the jbpm-installer)
** Open the Evaluation.bpmn process
** Open the com.sample.ProcessTest Java class
** Execute the ProcessTest class to run the process
* How to create a new jBPM project (including sample process and JUnit test)

You can import the evaluation project - a sample included in the jbpm-installer - by selecting "File -> Import ...", select "Existing Projects into Workspace" and browse to the  jbpm-installer/sample/evaluation folder and click "Finish".  You can open up the evaluation process and the ProcessTest class.
To execute the class, right-click on it and select  "Run as ... - Java Application".  The console should show how the process was started and how the different actors in the process completed the tasks assigned to them, to complete the process instance.

You could also create a new project using the jBPM project wizard.
The sample projects contain a process and an associated Java file to start the process.
Select "File - New ... - Project ..." and under the "jBPM" category, select "jBPM project" and click "Next".  Give the project a name and click "Next".  You can choose from a simple HelloWorld example or a slightly more advanced example using persistence and human tasks.
If you select the latter and click Finish, you should see a new project containing a "sample.bpmn" process and a "com.sample.ProcessTest" JUnit test class.
You can open the BPMN2 process by double-clicking it.
To execute the process, right-click on ProcessTest.java and select "Run As - Java Application".
