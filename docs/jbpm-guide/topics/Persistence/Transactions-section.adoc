= Transactions

The jBPM engine supports JTA transactions.
It also supports local transactions _only_ when using Spring.
It does not support pure local transactions  at the moment.
For more information about using Spring to set up persistence, please  see the Spring chapter in the Drools integration guide.

Whenever you do not provide transaction boundaries inside your application, the engine will automatically execute each method invocation on the engine in a separate transaction.
If this behavior is acceptable, you don't need to do anything else.
You can, however, also specify the transaction boundaries yourself.
This allows you, for example, to combine multiple commands into one transaction.

You need to register a transaction manager at the environment before using user-defined transactions.
The following sample code uses the Bitronix transaction manager.
Next, we use the Java Transaction API (JTA) to specify transaction boundaries, as shown below:

[source,java]
----
// create the entity manager factory
EntityManagerFactory emf = EntityManagerFactoryManager.get().getOrCreate("org.jbpm.persistence.jpa");
TransactionManager tm = TransactionManagerServices.getTransactionManager();

// setup the runtime environment
RuntimeEnvironment environment = RuntimeEnvironmentBuilder.Factory.get()
.newDefaultBuilder()
.addAsset(ResourceFactory.newClassPathResource("MyProcessDefinition.bpmn2"), ResourceType.BPMN2)
    .addEnvironmentEntry(EnvironmentName.TRANSACTION_MANAGER, tm)
    .get();

// get the kie session
RuntimeManager manager = RuntimeManagerFactory.Factory.get().newPerRequestRuntimeManager(environment);
RuntimeEngine runtime = manager.getRuntimeEngine(ProcessInstanceIdContext.get());
KieSession ksession = runtime.getKieSession();

// start the transaction
UserTransaction ut = InitialContext.doLookup("java:comp/UserTransaction");
ut.begin();

// perform multiple commands inside one transaction
ksession.insert( new Person( "John Doe" ) );
ksession.startProcess("MyProcess");

// commit the transaction
ut.commit();
----


Note that, if you use Bitronix as the transaction manager, you should also add a simple [path]_jndi.properties_
 file in you root classpath to register the Bitronix transaction manager in JNDI.
If you are using the jbpm-test module, this is already included by default.
If not, create a file named [path]_jndi.properties_
 with the following content:

[source,properties]
----
java.naming.factory.initial=bitronix.tm.jndi.BitronixInitialContextFactory
----


If you would like to use a different JTA transaction manager, you can change the [path]_persistence.xml_
 file to use your own transaction manager.
For example, when running inside JBoss Application Server v5.x or v7.x, you can use the JBoss transaction manager.
You need to change the transaction manager property in [path]_persistence.xml_
 to:

[source,properties]
----
<property name="hibernate.transaction.jta.platform" value="org.hibernate.transaction.JBossTransactionManagerLookup" />
----

[WARNING]
====
Using the (runtime manager) Singleton strategy with JTA transactions  (``UserTransaction`` or CMT) is not recommended because there is a race condition when  using this.
This race condition can result in an `IllegalStateException` with a  message similar to "Process instance XXX is disconnected.".

This race conditation can be avoided by explicitly synchronizing around the  `KieSession` instance when invoking the transaction in the user application code.

[source,java]
----
synchronized (ksession) {
    try {
        tx.begin();

        // use ksession
        // application logic

        tx.commit();
    } catch (Exception e) {
        //...
    }
}

== Container managed transactions

Special consideration need to be taken when embedding jBPM inside an application that executes in Container Managed Transaction (CMT) mode, for instance EJB beans.
This especially applies to application servers that does not allow accessing UserTransaction instance from JNDI when being part of container managed transaction, e.g.
WebSphere Application Server.
Since default implementation of transaction manager in jBPM is based on UserTransaction  to get transaction status which is used to decide if transaction should be started or not,  in environments that prevent accessing UserTrancation it won't do its job.
To secure proper execution in CMT environments a dedicated transaction manager implementation is provided:

[source,properties]
----
org.jbpm.persistence.jta.ContainerManagedTransactionManager
----

This transaction manager expects that transaction is active and thus will always return ACTIVE when invoking getStatus method.
Operations like begin, commit, rollback are no-op methods as transaction manager runs under managed transaction and can't affect it. 

[NOTE]
====
To make sure that container is aware of any exceptions that happened during process instance execution, user needs to ensure that exceptions thrown by the  engine are propagated up to the container to properly rollback transaction.
====


To configure this transaction manager following must be done:

* Insert transaction manager and persistence context manager into environment prior to creating/loading session 
+
[source,java]
----
Environment env = EnvironmentFactory.newEnvironment();
env.set(EnvironmentName.ENTITY_MANAGER_FACTORY, emf);
env.set(EnvironmentName.TRANSACTION_MANAGER, new ContainerManagedTransactionManager());
env.set(EnvironmentName.PERSISTENCE_CONTEXT_MANAGER, new JpaProcessPersistenceContextManager(env));
env.set(EnvironmentName.TASK_PERSISTENCE_CONTEXT_MANAGER, new JPATaskPersistenceContextManager(env));
----
* configure JPA provider (example hibernate and WebSphere) 
+
[source,java]
----

<property name="hibernate.transaction.factory_class" value="org.hibernate.transaction.CMTTransactionFactory"/>
<property name="hibernate.transaction.jta.platform" value="org.hibernate.service.jta.platform.internal.WebSphereJtaPlatform"/>
----

With following configuration jBPM should run properly in CMT environment.

=== CMT dispose ksession command

Usually when running within container managed transaction disposing ksession directly will cause 
exceptions on transaction completion as there are some transaction synchronization registered by 
jBPM to clean up the state after invocation is finished.

To overcome this problem specialized command has been provided 
`org.jbpm.persistence.jta.ContainerManagedTransactionDisposeCommand` which allows to simply 
execute this command instead of regular `ksession.dispose` which will ensure that ksession will be 
disposed at the transaction completion.
