= Process Management

This chapter describes the screens related with the creation and management of  process definitions and process instances.
 

Once you have modelled, configured all the technical details and build and deployed your projects containing your business processes you  should be able to see all the available process definitions in the Process Definition List.
For all the process definitions listed in the  Process Definitions List you will be able to inspect the Process Definition details and start as many Process Instances as needed.
The following sections describes the features provided by all the screens in charge of the manipulation of process definitions and process instances.
You can find these screens under the *Process Management* Menu, in the jBPM Console NG or in KIE Workbench. 

You can find the source code related with the process definition and instances manupilation inside this module: http://github.com/droolsjbpm/jbpm-console-ng/tree/master/jbpm-console-ng-process-runtime[

== Process Definitions

The process definition section is composed by two main screens: the Process Definition Lists and the Process Definition Details.

=== The Process Definition List

The process definition list shows all the available process definitions that were deployed into the platform.
Look at the Deployments section for more information about how to check all the deploymed units available in the platform runtime. 


image::Console/process-definitions-list.png[]

You can click in the list rows to access to the details of the process definition. 

=== The Process Definition Details

The process definition details shows all the available information about the process definition.
You can consider this screen as a brief about the process model.
You can quickly see if there is a Sub Process associated with it, or how many users and groups are participating in the selected definition.
 


image::Console/process-definitions-details.png[]

Notice that you can View the Process Model (Read Only mode) using the Options Menu in the top bar.
You can also look at all the process instances for the selected process definition by going to Options -> View Process Instances.

=== Creating Process Instances

You can create new Process Instances from the Process Definition List (Action Column), from the Process Definition Detail view or from the Process Instance. 


image::Console/process-definitions-new-instance.png[]

When you create a Process Instance usually a Form will be presented to introduce the information required by the process to be started.
Once you complete the required information and click on the Submit button, the instance will be created and the details of the Process Instance will be displayed on top of the Process Definition Details.
 

== Process Instances

The process instances section is composed by two main screens: the Process Instance Lists and the Process Instance Details.
In this case the Process Instance Details provides several tabs with the  runtime information related with the process. 


image::Console/process-instances-list.png[]

Each row inside the process instance list represent a running process instance from a particular Process Definition.
Each execution is differentiated from all the others by the internal state of the information that the process is manipulating.
In order to inspect this information you can click in each row to see the process instance details. 


image::Console/process-instances-details.png[]

As you can see the Process Instance Detail first tab gives you a quick overview about what is going on inside the process.
This is by showing  the current state of the instance and also the current activity that is being executed.
The process variables tab display all the process variables  that are being manipulated by the instance with the exception of the variables that contains documents.
 


image::Console/process-instances-variables.png[]

If the process contains a variable of the type: org.jbpm.Document it will be listed in the Documents tab, for easy access, download and manipulation of the attached documents.
Notice that at this point you cannot attach new documents to currently running instances, but this feature will be added in future versions. 


image::Console/process-instances-documents.png[]

Finally, the Logs tab shows two types of logs for different end users.
There are two types of Logs available inside the tab: Business and Technical.
 


image::Console/process-instances-logs.png[]

To complement the process logs you can open the Process Model that shows the completed activies in grey and the current activities highlighted in red.

=== Process Instance List

This list works with the concept of view.
A view is a set of visualization parameters that modify what items has to be displayed and how the items details has to be shown.

A view embrace

* Columns to be shown
* Items by page
* Restrictions over the displayed process instances
* A Name to be shown at tab name
* A Description as title when the view is selected

We find here different areas with different purposes:Filtering, general section configuration and specific view parameter setting in the data grid presentation:


image::Console/process-instances-areas.png[]

==== Filtering. Views on tabs

Here, there are the available views as tabs.
When a tab is selected, the related parameters are applied to the data grid.
Here we have include the Dataset technology for queries and its queries editor as a powerful tool to create the filters

The user can remove existing tabs clicking the cross button near the tab name


image::Console/process-instances-remove_tab.png[]

A new view can be created clicking the last tab, over the '+' button.
A New Items list popup appears and lets the user introduce parameters related with the new tab like: the name, the description and the filter.


image::Console/process-instances-create-tab-labels.png[]


image::Console/process-instances-create-tab-filter_1.png[]

If the view has to include a restriction over a specific column, then the link 'Add new' has to be selected.
A drop down list with all the columns to create restrictions


image::Console/process-instances-create-tab-filter_2.png[]

Once the column is selected, depending of its type, a new dropdown list is open with the kind of restrictions available for the selected column and the necessary form to add them.


image::Console/process-instances-create-tab-filter_3.png[]

One filter can include a list of different conditions over different columns and the editor allow remove each one clicking th 'x' button near them

Once the view creation parameters are defined, the 'Ok' button makes the new view appears as a new tab. 

==== General section configuration. Auto refresh and default views restore

In this area, the user can create a new item (in this case process instance), can refresh manually the view that is being displayed, can configure autorefresh option and can restore default filters.


image::Console/process-instances-generalarea.png[]

Auto refresh is a functionality that allows define how often the data grid has to be refresed.
The user can select one of the different values ( 1,5 or 10  minutes),or disable this feature, clicking 'Disable'. If the auto refresh is enabled, then the last view displayed is refreshed after the amount of time defined.

The last button is the 'Restore default filters'. There is a set of predefined views that appears the first time the user access to the section, in the case of process instances list they are: Active, Complete and Aborted.
The user can remove every view includind the default ones, but in this area the default views can be restored clicking 'Restore default filters'.

==== Specific view configuration. Columns, Bulk actions, number of items

In this area the user can change dynamically the view editable parameters like visible columns, or set the number  of items to show in a page.


image::Console/process-instances-column_selector.png[]

Here we have the posibility or execute bulk actions over the items marked as selected.
I this case the available actions are 'Abort' or 'Signal'


image::Console/process-instances-specific-area.png[]

The number of items to show in a page can be configurable too, from the page size dropdown list


image::Console/process-instances-number-items.png[]

==== Special filter in process instance list

There is an specific restriction than makes the process instance list view, have a different behaviour.
This happend when a filter over the column 'PROCESSID' is defined.

In this case, the columns available to show have been incremented with the specified process variables which have value.
The user can then, view process instance variables from a specific process id, in the same grid of the process instances.
