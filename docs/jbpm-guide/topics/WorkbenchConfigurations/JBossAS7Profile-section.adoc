= JBoss AS 7 Profile


In order to run the KIE Workbench (or the jBPM Console NG) in JBoss AS 7 you need to run it with full JBoss AS7 profile, so if you are installing it using a fresh JBoss AS7 please don`'t forget to start it using the full profile: 

[source,shell]
----

        ./standalone.sh â€“server-config=standalone-full.xml
----


Also notice that the repostiries that you clone inside the KIE Workbench will be kept inside the .niogit/ directory.
This directory will be placed in the same directory where you start the JBoss Application Server process, which means that if you run the ./standalone.sh script from the <jboss-as>/bin/ directory, the .niogit directory will be located in: <jboss-as>/bin/.niogit/. This is important if you want to clone the internal bare repositories to add, modify or remove files locally.
