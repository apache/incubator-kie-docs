= Domain Specific Tasks (Connectors)


Domain Specific Tasks (Connectors) are the way to integrate your business processes with external services that can be inside or outside your company.
These connectors are considered technical assets and because of that needs to be handled by technical users.
Most of the time it is recommended to not change/modify the connectors when the application is running, and for that reason these connectors needs to be provided for the application to use in runtime.
Three things are required to use a Custom Connector: 



* Provide an implementation of the WorkItemHandler interface, which is the one that will be executed in runtime.
* Bind the implementation to a Service Task name.
* Create the WorkItem Descriptor inside the tool.

In order to provide these three configuration points you can take a look at the Customer Relationship example in the jbpm-playground repository.

The main idea here is to have a separate project that contains the workItems implementations, for example: CreateCustomerWorkItemHandler, you will need to compile this project with Maven and install the produced JAR file inside the KIE-WB application.
In order to do that you just copy the customer-services-workitems-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar into the WEB-INF/lib directory of the kie-wb.war app.
On this example the workItemHandler implementations interacts with a public web service that you can check here, so you will require Internet connection in order to try this example. 

Notice also that inside the customer-relationship project there are some high level mappings of the Domain Specific Tasks that can be used inside our Customer Relationship Project -> WorkItemDefinitions.wid.

This configuration will basically add you Service Tasks inside the Process Designer Palette:

The last step is to bind the High Level mapping to their implementation for this environment.
You can do that by adding new entries into the WEB-INF/classes/META-INF/CustomWorkItemHandlers.conf file, for this example we just need to add the following entries: 

[source]
----
          …
        “CreateCustomer”: new org.jbpm.customer.services.CreateCustomerWorkItemHandler(),
        “AddCustomerComment”: new org.jbpm.customer.services.AddCustomerCommentsWorkItemHandler(),
        “ManagersReport”: new org.jbpm.customer.services.ManagersReportWorkItemHandler(),
        …
----
