== SubTasks

The "Subtasks" feature is an experimental feature in the task service. This feature 
allows one task to have sub-tasks in a parent-child relationship.  The parent task can 
auto-complete depending on the state of its children (and the subtask strategy used). 

You can use it by setting the `parentId` of a task, either when creating the task manually via the 
task service or otherwise by setting the `ParentId` parameter of the task definition in the BPMN2 
process definition.
