= Introduction


An important aspect of business processes is human task management.
While some of the work performed in a process can be executed automatically,  some tasks need to be executed by human actors. 

jBPM supports a special human task node inside processes for modeling this interaction with human users.
This human task node allows process designers to define the properties related to the task that the human  actor needs to execute, like for example the type of task, the actor(s), or the data associated with the task. 

jBPM also includes a so-called human task service, a back-end service that manages the life cycle of these tasks at runtime.
The jBPM implementation is based on the WS-HumanTask specification.
Note however that this implementation is fully pluggable,  meaning that users can integrate their own human task solution if necessary. 

In order to have human actors participate in your processes, you first need to (1) include human task nodes inside your process to  model the interaction with human actors, (2) integrate a task management component (like for example the WS-HumanTask based implementation  provided by jBPM) and (3) have end users interact with a human task client to request their task list and claim and complete the tasks  assigned to them.
Each of these three elements will be discussed in more detail in the next sections.
