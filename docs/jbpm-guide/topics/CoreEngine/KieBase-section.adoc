= KieBase

The jBPM API allows you to first create a knowledge base.
This knowledge base should include all your process definitions that might need to be executed by that session.
To create a knowledge base, use a KieHelper to load processes from various resources (for example from the classpath or from the file system), and then create a new knowledge base from that helper.
The following code snippet shows how to create a knowledge base consisting of only one process  definition (using in this case a resource from the classpath).

[source,java]
----

  KieHelper kieHelper = new KieHelper();
  KieBase kieBase = kieHelper
                    .addResource(ResourceFactory.newClassPathResource("MyProcess.bpmn"))
                    .build();
----

The ResourceFactory has similar methods to load files from file system, from URL, InputStream, Reader, etc.

This is considered manual creation of knowledge base and while it is simple it is not recommended for real application development but more for try outs.
Following you'll find recommended and much more powerful way of building knowledge base, knowledge session and more - RuntimeManager.
