= Form generated description


When the form has been generated automatically, this tab contain the process variables as data origins.
This allow bind form fields with them, this relation it`'s linked creating data bindings. 

A data binding define how task inputs will be mapped to form variables, and when the form is validated and submitted, how the values will update the task outputs.

For example, for this process, the following bindings are generated.
Notice that the identifiers are automatically generated.
You can have as many data origins as required, and can use a different colour to identify it. 

In automatic form generation, a data origin is created for each process variable.
The generated form have a field for each data origin bindable item (view FieldTypes) and this automatic fields have the binding defined too. 

When these fields are displayed in editor the color of the data origin is shown over the field to make easy view if the field is correctly bound and the data origin implied.
