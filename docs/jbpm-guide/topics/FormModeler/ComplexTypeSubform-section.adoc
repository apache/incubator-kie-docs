= Simple Object (Subform field Type)


One possible way of setting the value for an object property is by using an existing form, and embedding this form into the parent.
This is called subform. 

In this example, the Purchase Order header data is held in an object.
Therefore, we must create a form to enter all the purchase order header data and link it from the parent task form. 

We will follow the steps:

. Create new form.

. Add fields by origin. All the properties are shown, and can be added to the form, either one by one or all of them at once.

.Add fields by origin

All the properties have been added to the form, and now we can edit each of them and move them around.

. Configure the fields and customize form.
. Once the form has been saved, open the initial parent form and set the field property 'Default form'.

.Configure the parent form

This will insert the subform inside the parent form, and will be shown as below:
