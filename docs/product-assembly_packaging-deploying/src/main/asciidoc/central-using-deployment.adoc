= Using {CENTRAL} to deploy and manage decision services

You can use {CENTRAL} to build and deploy decision services. If you connect multiple {KIE_SERVERS} to the {CENTRAL}, you can use the web UI to deploy and manage decision services on all the servers.

You can group {KIE_SERVERS} into different _server templates_. The same decision services are automatically run servers belonging to the same server template. But you can deploy different decision services or different versions of decision services on different templates.

You can configure the template name for each {KIE_SERVER} in the configuration file for that server.

IMPORTANT: You can not move a {KIE_SERVER} into a different template using {CENTRAL}. You must change the configuration file of the server to change the server template name for it.
