= Building and deploying a decision service in {CENTRAL}

You can build a decision service in {CENTRAL} and automatically deploy it on a {KIE_SERVER}.

.Procedure
. In the main menu, click *Projects*. 
. Click the project name.
. Click the *Build & Deploy* button.
. If only one {KIE_SERVER} is connected to the {CENTRAL}, or if all connected {KIE_SERVERS} are in the same server template, the project is automatically built and deployed. Otherwise, {CENTRAL} displays a dialog. In this dialog, set the following values:
** *Container ID* and *Container Alias* identify the container running the service within the {KIE_SERVER}. You normally do not need to change these settings.
** *Server template* : select the server template for deploying this project. You can later deploy it to other templates without rebuilding it.
** *Start container?* : if you clear this box, the service is deployed onto the server but not started. Normally, leave this box checked.
