= Configuring a {KIE_SERVER} to run a decision service

You can configure a {KIE_SERVER} to load and run a decision service automatically without using a {CENTRAL}. The service must be present in a Maven repository. You need access information for the repository and the GAV values for the service. You can also stop and delete the service from this server at a later time. You can start several services on one {KIE_SERVER} at the same time.

//@doclink need to double-check name and add link if possible
IMPORTANT: do not use this procedure for a {KIE_SERVER} deployed on OpenShift. See Decision Manager on Openshift for instructions about configuring a a {KIE_SERVER} to load and run a decision service from a Maven repository.

== Configuring a {KIE_SERVER} to use a Maven repository

Before you can load and start a decision service on a {KIE_SERVER}, you need to configure the server to use your Maven repository.

.Procedure

//@doclink need to double-check name and add link if possible, also need to see what home dir we are talking about
. Install the {KIE_SERVER}. See Installing {PRODUCT} for instructions.
. Create a Maven `settings.xml` file with connetion and access details for your external repository. For details about the `settings.xml` file, see Maven documentation: https://maven.apache.org/settings.html .
. In the `<eap_home>/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml` file, under the `<system-properties>` tag, set the `kie.maven.settings.custom` property to the full pathname of the `settings.xml` file, for example:
+
[source,xml]
----
<property name="kie.maven.settings.custom" value="/opt/custom-config/settings.xml"/>
----
+
. Start or restart the {KIE_SERVER}.

== Loading and starting a service on the {KIE_SERVER}

If you have configured a {KIE_SERVER} to use a Maven repository, you can use an API call to load a service, The service is started automatically.

.Procedure
. To load a service into a container in the {KIE_SERVER} and start it, run the following command to send an API request:
[subs="verbatim,macros"]
+
----
$ curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X PUT -d '{"container-id" : "<containerID>","release-id" : {"group-id" : "<groupID>","artifact-id" : "<artifactID>","version" : "<version>"}}' http://<serverhost>:<serverport>/kie-server/services/rest/server/containers/<containerID>
----
+
where:
+
** *<containerID>* is the identifier for the container. You can use any random identifier but it must be the same in both places in the command (the URL and the data).
+
** *<groupID>*, *<artifactID>*, *version* are GAV values.
+
** *<serverhost>* is the host name for the KIE server, or `localhost` if you are running the command on the same host as the KIE server.
+
** *<serverport>* is the port number for the KIE server
+
For example:
+
[subs="verbatim,macros"]
----
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X PUT -d '{"container-id" : "kie1","release-id" : {"group-id" : "org.kie.server.testing","artifact-id" : "container-crud-tests1","version" : "2.1.0.GA"}}' http://localhost:39043/kie-server/services/rest/server/containers/kie1
----

== Stopping and removing a service from the {KIE_SERVER}

You can use an API call to stop and remove a service from the {KIE_SERVER}. You need the container identifier that was configured when loading the service.

.Procedure
. To stop and remove a container with a service on the {KIE_SERVER}, run the following command to send an API request:
[subs="verbatim,macros"]
+
----
$ curl -X DELETE http://<serverhost>:<serverport>/kie-server/services/rest/server/containers/<containerID>
----
+
where:
+
** *<containerID>* is the identifier for the container. 
+
** *<serverhost>* is the host name for the KIE server, or `localhost` if you are running the command on the same host as the KIE server.
+
** *<serverport>* is the port number for the KIE server
+
For example:
+
[subs="verbatim,macros"]
----
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:39043/kie-server/services/rest/server/containers/kie1
----
