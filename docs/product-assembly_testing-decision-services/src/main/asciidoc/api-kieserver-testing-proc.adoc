= Testing the API calls on a {KIE_SERVER} using its web UI

If you have deployed a decision service on a {KIE_SERVER}, but do not have an application that can call the decision service, you can use a web UI provided by the {KIE_SERVER} to test calls to the service.

.Procedure

This should describe using the interface that I am told is at http://<address>:8080/kie-server/docs but I was not able to access it on my OpenShift install.
