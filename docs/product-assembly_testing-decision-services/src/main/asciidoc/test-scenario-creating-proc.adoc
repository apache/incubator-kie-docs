= Creating and running a test scenario in {CENTRAL}

In a Test Scenario, you can enter a set of facts on which the rules can be used, the method to run, and the expected result. When the test scenario runs, rules are fired on the facts and the actual result is compared to the actual results.

.Procedure

. In the main view of a project, click *Create New Asset*, then select *Test Scenario*.
. In the *Test Scenario* field, enter the name of the test scenario and click *Ok* 
. Click *Given* to add the necessary data. 

THIS NEEDS MORE DETAIL. Upstream doc https://docs.jboss.org/drools/release/7.5.0.Final/drools-docs/html_single/index.html#_drools.testscenarioeditor has nearly no detail. Also, I did not work out the "Call method" and "Globals" part and don't really understand "Expect" either.

. To run the test scenario, click *Run scenario*. Alternatively, to run all the test scenarios that exist for this project, click *Run all scenarios*. If any actual result is different fromt he expected result, {CENTRAL} reports an error.
