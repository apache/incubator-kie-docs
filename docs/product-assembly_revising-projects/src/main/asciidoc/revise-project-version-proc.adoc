= Revising project versions

You can build and deploy a new instance of a project, which also revises the version number of a project in {PRODUCT}. Creating a new version of a project preserves the old version in case there is a problem with the new one and you need to revert back.

.Prerequisites
The {KIE_SERVER} is deployed and connected to the {CENTRAL}.

.Procedure
. Log in to {CENTRAL} and click *Menu* -> *Design* -> *Projects*.
. Click on the project you want to deploy, for example *Mortgage Process*.
. Click *Deploy*.
+
* If there is no container with the project name, a container with default values is automatically created.
* If an older version of the project is already deployed, go to the project settings and change the project version. When finished, save the change and click *Deploy*. This will deploy a new version of the same project with the latest changes in place, alongside the older version(s).
. To verify the deployment, click *Menu* -> *Manage* -> *Process Definitions*, and click image:btn_refresh.png[].
. Click on the three vertical dots in the *Actions* column and select *Start* to start a new instance of the process.
