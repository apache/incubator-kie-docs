== Minor API changes of Kie DMN open source engine 

The API of Kie DMN open source engine introduces some minor changes, in order to support the new DMN v1.2 format.

A new package `org.kie.dmn.model.api` inside Maven module `kie-dmn-model` provides a generic model to support for both DMN versions v1.1 and v1.2.
This requires users of previous versions to update references from previous package `org.kie.dmn.model.v1_1` to this new package `org.kie.dmn.model.api`.

TIP: Users of the Kie DMN API must update references of import packages from `import org.kie.dmn.model.v1_1.*;` to `import org.kie.dmn.model.api.*;`.

Package `org.kie.dmn.api.marshalling.v1_1` has been deprecated in favour of `org.kie.dmn.api.marshalling`; normally this shouldn't impact end-users of the Kie DMN API as the `DMNRuntime` will automatically provide support for both DMN v1.1 and v1.2. This change impacts users who manage the marshaling of DMN resources manually, who must upgrade to the new package in order to support the new DMN v1.2 version.
