= What is New and Noteworthy in Drools 7.0
:imagesdir: ..

== Core Engine

=== DMN Runtime Support

Drools now has complete runtime support for DMN (Decision Model and Notation). DMN files are now an asset
that can be added to any kjar for execution. Please refer to the <<DMN-chapter.adoc#drools.DMN,DMN section>>
for details on how to build and execute DMN models.

At this time, no DMN authoring is supported, but it will be supported in future versions.

=== Multithreaded rule engine

[WARNING]
====
This feature is experimental
====

Historically Rete has always been a sequential algorithm and even if Phreak, its evolution introduced in Drools 6, allowed
some degree of parallelization, this possibility wasn't concretely leveraged yet. In Drools 7 is finally possible to make
the engine to evaluate more rules in parallel. This is achieved by partitioning the Rete/Phreak in independent partitions
and evaluating them in parallel.

This feature is off by default, but it's possible to create a parallel KieBase by enabling it via the ``KieBaseConfiguration`` as it follows:

[source]
----
KieServices ks = KieServices.Factory.get();
KieBaseConfiguration kieBaseConf = ks.newKieBaseConfiguration();
kieBaseConf.setOption(MultithreadEvaluationOption.YES);
KieBase kieBase = kieContainer.newKieBase(kieBaseConf);
----

or alternatively through the system property:

[source]
----
drools.multithreadEvaluation = true
----

[WARNING]
====
Rules using queries, salience or agenda-group are currently not supported by the parallel engine. In case they are present inside
the rule base the compiler emits a warning and automatically switches back using the single threaded implementation. There are
other cases where using the multithreaded rule engine is not correct and leads to wrong results even if the engine may be not
able to automatically detect them and then will not fallback to the single thread mode, e.g. rules rely on implicit salience
given by rule ordering inside the drl file. For this reason particular attention must be paid when enabling this option.
Finally at the moment session serialization and incremental compilation are not supported.
====

=== OOPath improvements

[WARNING]
====
This feature is experimental
====

OOPath has been introduced with Drools 6.3.0 but in Drools 7.0.0 the syntax has been slightly changed to make it closer to standard
xpath one. This means that constraints have to be put between square brackets instead of curly ones and inline cast has to be
expressed out of constraints. For instance the following oopath expressed with 6.x syntax:

[source,java]
----
/list{#SubClass, prop == 0}
----

in Drools 7.x becomes:

[source,java]
----
/list#SubClass[prop == 0]
----

Also Drools 7.0.0 improves the support for standard Java Collection, with a dedicated implementation for `List` and `Set`,
as specialized `ReactiveList` and `ReactiveSet`; a `ReactiveCollection` is also available.
This also includes out of the box reactive support when performing mutable operations through their `Iterator` and `ListIterator`.

.Example:
[source,java]
----
public class School extends AbstractReactiveObject {
    private String name;
    private final List<Child> children = new ReactiveList<Child>(); // <1>

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
        notifyModification(); // <2>
    }
    
    public void addChild(Child child) {
        children.add(child); // <3>
        // no need to call notifyModification() here.
    }
----
<1> Using specialized `ReactiveList` for reactive support over standard Java `List`.
<2> Usually `notifyModification()` is required to be called when a field is changed for reactive support
<3> but in the case of `ReactiveList` this is handled automatically, like every other mutating operations performed over the field `children`.

TIP: As a best-practice, it is recommended to declare reactive collection fields `final` as per the example shown.

==== OOPath Maven plug-in

The Kie Maven plug-in offers a new goal `injectreactive` to instrument bytecode and automatically inject reactivity support for standard cases.

The `injectreactive` goal is disabled by default, and can be enabled via Maven plug-in configuration `instrument-enabled` settings.

.Example:
[source,xml]
----
<groupId>org.kie</groupId>
<artifactId>kie-maven-plugin</artifactId>
<extensions>true</extensions>
<configuration>
    <instrument-enabled>true</instrument-enabled> <!--1-->
</configuration>
----
<1> Enable the `injectreactive` goal.

The `injectreactive` goal will instrument bytecode pertaining to the Maven project build's output directory `${project.build.outputDirectory}`.

It is possible to limit the scope of the goal to a specific package or hierarchy of packages via Maven plug-in 
configuration `instrument-packages` settings list.
.Example:
[source,xml]
----
<groupId>org.kie</groupId>
<artifactId>kie-maven-plugin</artifactId>
<extensions>true</extensions>
<configuration>
    <instrument-enabled>true</instrument-enabled> 
    <instrument-packages>
        <instrumentPackage>to.instrument</instrumentPackage> <!--1-->
        <instrumentPackage>org.drools.compiler.xpath.tobeinstrumented.*</instrumentPackage> <!--2-->
    </instrument-packages>
</configuration>
----
<1> Limit scope of instrumentation specifically to `to.instrument` package only.
<2> Limit scope of instrumentation to `org.drools.compiler.xpath.tobeinstrumented` and its children packages.

The plug-in will instrument bytecode for every field assignment under the following standard cases: 

* a field assignment will also trigger `notifyModification()`
* wrap any field defined as List with a `ReactiveList`
* wrap any field defined as Set with a `ReactiveSet`
* wrap any field defined as Collection with a `ReactiveCollection`

NOTE: In order for a field of type List/Set to be wrapped correctly, the field member of the java class must be declared specifically using either 
`java.util.Collection`, `java.util.List` or `java.util.Set`
(declaring for instance a field as `java.util.ArrayList` will not be instrumented with the specialized reactive collections).

WARNING: It is not recommended to mix manual support for reactivity (implemented manually) and the bytecode instrumentation Maven plug-in; it is better envisaged to keep the two scopes distinct, for instance by making use of the plug-in configuration to instrument only specific packages as documented above.

The following section present detailed examples of the plug-in instrumentation.

===== Instrumentation of field assignments

A field assignment like in the following example:

.Original:
[source,java]
----
public class Toy {
    private String owner;
    ...
    
    public void setOwner(String owner) {
        this.owner = owner;
    }
}
----

will be instrumented by intercepting the field assignment and triggering the `notifyModification()`:

.Result:
[source,java]
----
public class Toy implements ReactiveObject {
    private String owner;
    ...

    public void setOwner(final String owner) {
        this.$$_drools_write_owner(owner);
    }

    public void $$_drools_write_owner(final String owner) {
        this.owner = owner;
        ReactiveObjectUtil.notifyModification((ReactiveObject) this);
    }
}
----

Please notice this instrumentation applies only if the field is not a `Collection`.

In the case the field assignment is referring a `List` or a `Set`, the instrumentation will wrap the assignment with a `ReactiveList` or ``ReactiveSet` accordingly; for example:

.Original:
[source,java]
----
public class School {
    private final String name;
    private final List<Child> children = new ArrayList<Child>();
    ...

    public School(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public List<Child> getChildren() {
        return children;
    }
}
----

will be instrumented by intercepting and wrapping with `ReactiveList`:

.Result:
[source,java]
----
public class School implements ReactiveObject {
    private final String name;
    private final List<Child> children;

    public School(final String name) {
        this.$$_drools_write_children(new ArrayList());
        this.name = name;
    }

    public List<Child> getChildren() {
        return this.children;
    }
    
    public void $$_drools_write_children(final List list) {
        this.children = (List<Child>) new ReactiveList(list);
    } 
----

=== PMML Support

[WARNING]
====
This feature is experimental
====

NOTE: This feature makes use of <<_rule_units_2,Rule Units>>

Drools now support assets that conform to a subset of the Predictive Modeling Markup Language (PMML). The following
predictive model types are now supported:

* Regression
* Scorecard
* Tree

Additionally, the Mining model type has partial support; with the following modes currently available:

* Model Chain
* Select All
* Select First

Further modes of operation will be supported as they become available.

=== Soft expiration for events

When explicitly defining an event expiration in Drools 6.x, it is always considered an hard expiration, meaning that it always
takes precedence on any other expiration implicitly calculated on temporal windows and constraints where the event is involved.
Drools 7 also allows to specify a soft expiration for events that can be used if the inferred expiration offset is infinite.
In this way it is possible to have a guaranteed expiration that is either the inferred one or the specified one if the other
is missing. Moreover this implies that rule authors are not required to include a temporal constraint in all rules and then
event classes can be designed even if the rules are not yet known.

By default event expiration is considered to be hard, but it is possible to change the expiration policy and define a soft
expiration either annotating the event's class as it follows:

[source,java]
----
@Role(Role.Type.EVENT)
@Expires( value = "30s", policy = TIME_SOFT )
public class MyEvent { ... }
----

or using a type declaration:

[source]
----
declare MyEvent
  @role( event )
  @expires(value = 30s, policy = TIME_SOFT)
end
----

=== Rule Units

[WARNING]
====
This feature is experimental
====

Rule units represent a purely declarative approach to partition a rules set into smaller units, binding different data sources
to those units and orchestrate the execution of the individual unit. A rule unit is an aggregate of data sources, global variables
and rules.

== Workbench

Apart from the generic improvements to the workbench (listed below in a separate section), there are also some Drools-specific enhancements in the workbench.

=== DMN style hit policies for Decision Tables

With each Hit Policy, by default a row has priority over each row below it.

* Unique Hit
With unique hit policy each row has to be unique meaning there can be no overlap. There can never be a situation where two rows can fire, if there is the Verification feature warns about this on development time.
* First Hit
First hit fires only one row, the one that is satisfied first from top to bottom.
* Resolved Hit
Similar to First Hit, but you can for example give row 10 priority over row 5. This means you can keep the order of the rows you want for visual readability, but specify priority exceptions.
* Rule Order
Multiple rows can fire and Verification does not report about conflicts between the rows since they are expected to happen.
* None
This is the normal hit mode. Old decision tables will use this by default, but since 7.0 uses PHREAK the row order now matters. There is no migration tooling needed for the old tables. Multiple rows can fire. Verification warns about rows that conflict.

=== Guided Rule Editor : Support formulae in composite field constraints

Composite field constraints now support use of formulae.

When adding constraints to a Pattern the "Multiple Field Constraint" selection ("All of (and)" and "Any of (or)") supports use of formulae in addition to expressions.

=== Guided Decision Table Editor : New editor

The Guided Decision Table Editor has been extensively rewritten to support editing of multiple tables in the same editor. Tables that share an association are visibly linked making it easier to visualise relationships. Associations are infered from Actions that create or update a Fact consumed by the Conditions of another table.

Highlights include:-

- A new look and feel
- Resizable columns
- Reordering of columns by dragging and dropping "in table"
- Reordering of rows by dragging and dropping "in table"
- Repositioning of tables with drag and drop
- Panning of view to scroll content
- Zoomable view, so you can zoom "out" to see more content at once
- File locks and Version History per Decision Table

=== Guided Decision Table Editor : Caching of enumeration lookups

The Guided Decision Table Editor has long been capable of using enumeration definitions. However since a table can contain many cells performance of enumerations could sometimes be less than ideal if the definition required a server round-trip to retrieve the lookups from a helper class. 

Results from server round-trips are now cached in the client hence removing the need for successive network calls when cells are modified. The cache is initialised when the editor is opened and populated on demand.

=== Guided Decision Table Editor : Verification and Validation

==== System Property
It is possible to disable the Verification & Validation with the system property **``**org.kie.verification.disable-dtable-realtime-verification**``**. This can be useful for large decision tables or if the users want to ignore V&V.

==== Range Checks

The verification takes the first steps towards helping you to make complete decision tables. In the next release we add the support for checking if all the ranges are covered for boolean, numeric and date values. This means if your table has a check for if an Application is approved the verification report will remind you to make sure you also handle situations where the Application was not approved.

==== Unique Single Hit

In the past verification and validation has raised an issue if rows subsume each other. If a row subsumes another, then the conditions can be satisfied with the same set of facts. Meaning two rows from the same table can fire at the same time. In some cases subsumption does not matter, but in other cases you want to have a table where only one rule fires at the time. The table is then a single hit decision table. To help the making of single hit tables where only one row can fire, the verification keeps an eye on the conditions. Reporting situations when single hit is broken.


= Breaking changes in Drools 7.0 from 6.x
:imagesdir: ..

== Property reactivity enabled by default

Property reactivity has been introduced in Drools 5.4 but users had to explicitly enable it on a class by class basis through
the `@PropertyReactive` annotation or on the whole knowledge base using the `PropertySpecificOption.ALWAYS` builder option.
However, since using this feature is considered a good practice both under correctness and performance points of view, it has
been enabled by default in Drools 7.0. If required it is possible to disable property reactivity and reconfigure Drools 7.0
to work exactly as it did in version 6.x by adding the following configuration to the kmodule.xml file.

[source]
----
<configuration>
  <property key="drools.propertySpecific" value="ALLOWED"/>
</configuration>
----

== Type preserving accumulate functions

In Drools 6 when using the ``sum`` function inside an accumulate pattern the result was always a Double regardless of the
field type on which the sum was performed. This caused the following 3 problems:

* Loss of precision: the sum of a long `1881617265586265321L` will incorrectly return `1.88161726558626534E18`.
The BigDecimal sum of `0.09` and `0.01` will also be incorrect.

* Loss of performance: summing with a Double total is significantly slower than summing with a Long or an Integer.

* Leaked complexity: it enforced the user to pattern matching on Double, or more generically (suggested choice) on Number,
while it may be expected that the result of summing on a field of type Integer would be an Integer as well.

Conversely Drools 7 preserves the type of the expression on which the sum is executed, so it will be possible to directly
match on that type as in:

[source]
----
Long(...) from accumulate(..., sum($p.getLongWeight()))
----

== Renaming TimedRuleExecutionOption

The KieSession option to control when timed rules have to be automatically executed has been renamed into `TimedRuleExecutionOption` fixing a typing mistake in its name which affected previous releases; the property has been aligned into `drools.timedRuleExecution`.

[cols="3", options="header"]

|KieSession option
|`TimedRuleExectionOption`
|`TimedRuleExecutionOption`

|property
|`drools.timedRuleExection`
|`drools.timedRuleExecution`
|===

== Renaming and unification of configuration files

In Drools 6.x, the default Drools configuration properties were configured in two distinct files:
*  `drools.default.rulebase.conf` located in the META-INF folder of drools-core 
*  `drools.default.packagebuilder.conf` located in the META-INF folder of of drools-compiler

In Drools 7.0.0, these files are unified into a single one named `kie.default.properties.conf`, located in the META-INF folder of drools-core.
If you want to override the default values of these properties or add your own, you can put them in a file called `kie.properties.conf` located in the META-INF folder of your project.
