= Guided Decision Tables
:imagesdir: ..

The Guided Decision Table editor supports authoring decision tables. Rule attributes, meta-data, conditions and actions can be defined in a tabular format thus facilitating rapid entry of large sets of related rules. Web-based decision table rules are compiled into DRL like all other rule assets.

Data Objects available in the project, either manually created with the Data Object Editor or present in dependencies added to the Project, can be used in column definitions.

[[_drools.guideddecisiontableeditortypesofdecisiontable]]
== Types of decision table

There are broadly two different types of decision table, both of which are supported in the Workbench:-

* Extended Entry
* Limited Entry


[[_drools.guideddecisiontableeditorextendedentrydecisiontable]]
=== Extended Entry


An Extended Entry decision table is one for which the column definitions, or stubs, specify Pattern, Field and operator but not value. The values, or states, are themselves held in the body of the decision table. It is normal, but not essential, for the range of possible values to be restricted by limiting entry to values from a list. The Workbench supports use of Java enumerations, Workbench enumerations or decision table "optional value lists" to restrict value entry.

[[_drools.guideddecisiontableeditorlimitedentrydecisiontable]]
=== Limited Entry

A Limited Entry decision table is one for which the column definitions specify a value in addition to Pattern, Field and operator. The decision table states, held in the body of the table, are boolean where a positive value (a checked tick-box) has the effect of meaning the column should apply, or be matched. A negative value (a cleared tick-box) means the column does not apply.

.Limited Entry Decision table

[[_drools.guideddecisiontableeditornavigation]]
=== Navigation

The editor can be "panned" by pressing the left-mouse button and dragging. Tables can also be repositioned by left-clicking on the table title and dragging. Double-clicking the table title locks the table in the editor preventing repositioning; however content overflowing the visible bounds of the editor can be scrolled into view by panning the editor.

Cells can be selected in a variety of ways:-

* Firstly individual cells can be double-clicked and an in-cell editor corresponding to the underlying data-type will appear. Groups of cells in the same column can be selected by clicking in the first cell and then clicking the extent of the required range with the shift key pressed.
* Secondly the keyboard cursor keys can be used to navigate around the table. Pressing the enter key will pop-up the corresponding editor. Ranges can be selected by pressing the shift key whilst extending the range with the cursor keys.

Columns can be resized by hovering over the corresponding divider in the table body.
The mouse pointer will change and then the column width dragged either narrower or wider.

Columns can be moved by hovering over the corresponding header in the table header. The mouse pointer will change to indicate the operation is possible and then the column can be dragged to a new permissible position. Constraints on individual fields can be repositioned within their parent pattern. Blocks of columns for a single pattern can be repositioned by dragging the pattern header.

==== Menus

===== Menu bar

The principle menu bar contains items to perform the following actions:

* Save

Saves changes made in the Editor.

* Delete

Delete the table entirely.

* Rename

Rename the table.

* Copy

Copy the file.

* Validate

Validate the rules generated from the table.

* Edit

Cut, copy, paste, delete cells selected within the table.

* View

Adjust the "zoom" level of the view and toggle between merged state. The Audit Log can also be viewed.

* Insert

Insert rows or columns.

* Radar

The Radar shows a "mini-view" of the editor. Tables and the region visible in the Editor are simply represented by rectangles. The User can drag the visble region rectangle to reposition the Editor's visible range.

.Radar
image::Workbench/AuthoringAssets/dtable-radar.png[align="center"]

* Version history

Shows the different versions of the table.

===== Context menu

Pressing the right mouse button whilst over the table shows a context menu. The context menu differs depending on whether the mouse pointer is hovering over a cell or the first, row number, column. The options available in each however is consistent offering the User the ability to cut, copy, insert or delete items.

.Context menu
image::Workbench/AuthoringAssets/dtable-context-menu.png[align="center"]

[[_drools.guideddecisiontableeditorcellmerging]]
=== Cell merging

The View->Merged menu entry toggles cell merging on and off. When cells are merged those in the same column with identical values are merged into a single cell. This simplifies changing the value of multiple cells that shared the same original value. When cells are merged they also gain an icon in the top-left of the cell that allows rows spanning the merged cell to be grouped.

.Cell merging
image::Workbench/AuthoringAssets/dtable-merged.png[align="center"]


[[_drools.guideddecisiontableeditorcellgrouping]]
=== Cell grouping

Cells that have been merged can be further collapsed into a single row. Clicking the triangular icon in the top right of a merged cell collapses the corresponding rows into a single entry. Cells in other columns spanning the collapsed rows that have identical values are shown unchanged. Cells in other columns spanning the collapsed rows that have different values are highlighted and the first value displayed.

.Cell grouping
image::Workbench/AuthoringAssets/dtable-grouped.png[align="center"]


When the value of a grouped cell is altered all cells that have been collapsed also have their values updated.

[[_drools.guideddecisiontableeditorotherwiseoperation]]
=== Operation of "otherwise"


Condition columns defined with literal values that use either the equality (==) or inequality (!=) operators can take advantage of a special decision table cell value of "otherwise". This special value allows a rule to be defined that matches on all values not explicitly defined in all other rules defined in the table.
This is best illustrated with an example:-

[source]
----
when
  Cheese( name not in ("Cheddar", "Edam", "Brie") )
  ...
then
  ...
end
----

[source]
----
when
  Cheese( name in ("Cheddar", "Edam", "Brie") )
  ...
then
  ...
end
----


[[_drools.guideddecisiontableeditordefining]]
== Defining a web based decision table

=== Defining the table

A table can either be defined manually or using a Wizard that walks the User through creation of columns. The Wizard only supports simple column definitions; should the User need more sophisticated column definitions these need to be added manually after initial creation.

When a new empty decision table has been created the User needs to define columns for Facts, their constraints and corresponding actions.

[[_drools.guideddecisiontableeditordefiningmanuallycolumns]]
==== Manual creation

*->Guilherme please add details of the Wizard here; and re-word as you see fit!*

To add a column click on the "New column" icon.

By default the column type popup only shows the following simple types:-

* Add a new Metadata\Attribute column
* Add a simple Condition
* Set the value of a field
* Set the value of a field on a new fact
* Delete an existing fact

Clicking on "Include advanced options" adds the following additional "advanced" column types for more advanced use cases:-

* Add a Condition BRL fragment
* Execute a Work Item
* Set the value of a field with a Work Item parameter
* Set the value of a field on a new Fact with a Work Item parameter
* Add an Action BRL fragment


[[_drools.guideddecisiontableeditorsimplecolumns]]
==== Simple column types

[[_drools.guideddecisiontableeditormetadatacolumns]]
===== Metadata

Zero or more meta-data columns can be defined, each represents the normal meta-data annotation on DRL rules.

[[_drools.guideddecisiontableeditorattributecolumns]]
===== Attributes

Zero or more attribute columns representing any of the DRL rule attributes (e.g.
salience, timer, enabled etc) can be added. An additional pseudo attribute is provide in the guided decision table editor to "negate" a rule. Use of this attribute allows complete rules to be negated. For example the following simple rule can be negated as also shown.

[source]
----
when
  $c : Cheese( name == "Cheddar" )
then
  ...
end
----

[source]
----
when
  not Cheese( name == "Cheddar" )
then
  ...
end
----

[[_drools.guideddecisiontableeditorsimplecondition]]
===== Simple Condition

Conditions represent constraints on Fact Patterns defined in the left-hand side, or "when" portion, of a rule. To define a condition column the User must first select or define a Fact Pattern bound to a model class. 

The user can choose to negate the pattern.

Once this has been completed the User can define field constraints.

If two or more columns are defined using the same fact pattern binding the field constraints become composite field constraints on the same pattern.

If the User define multiple bindings for a single model class each binding becomes a separate model class in the left-hand side of the rule.

When the User edits or creates a new column, they will be given a choice of the type of constraint:-

* Literal : The value in the cell will be compared with the field using the operator.
* Formula: The expression in the cell will be evaluated and then compared with the field.
* Predicate : No field is needed, the expression will be evaluated to true or false.


[[_drools.decisiontablesetfield]]
===== Set the value of a field

An Action to set the value of a field on previously bound fact.
The User has the option to notify the Rule Engine of the modified values which could lead to other rules being re-activated.


[[_drools.guideddecisiontableeditorsetfieldonnewfact]]
===== Set the value of a field on a new fact

An Action to insert a new Fact into the Rule Engine Working Memory and set the a value of one of the new Facts' fields.

The User can choose to have the new Fact "logically inserted" meaning it will be automatically deleted should the conditions leading to the action being invoked cease to be true.

Please refer to the Drools Expert documentation for details on Truth Maintenance and Logical insertions.

[[_drools.guideddecisiontableeditordeletefact]]
===== Delete an existing fact

An Action to delete a bound Fact.

[[_drools.guideddecisiontableeditoradvancedcolumns]]
==== Advanced column types

[[_drools.guideddecisiontableeditorconditionbrl]]
===== Condition BRL fragments

A construct that allows a BRL fragment to be used in the left-hand side of a rule.
A BRL fragment is authored using the Guided Rule Editor and hence all features available in that editor can be used to define a decision table column; such as "from", "collect" and "accumulate" etc.

When using the embedded Guided Rule Editor field values defined as "Template Keys" will form columns in the decision table.

Facts and Fact's fields bound in the BRL fragment can be referenced by the simpler column types and vice-versa.

In the following example two Template Keys have been defined and hence two columns appear in the decision table.

[NOTE]
====
The User can use "Free Form DRL" to define Condition columns too.
If the User needs a place-holder for a variable in the DRL the User can use the Drools Templates syntax of `@{variable-name}` for example ``Smurf( name = "@{name}" )``.

[[_drools.guideddecisiontableeditorexecuteworkitem]]
===== Execute a Work Item


An Action invoking a jBPM Work Item Handler setting its input parameters to bound Facts\Facts fields values.

[[_drools.guideddecisiontableeditorsetworkitemparameter]]
===== Set the value of a field with a Work Item parameter


An Action setting the value of a Fact's field to that of a jBPM Work Item Handler's result parameter.

[[_drools.guideddecisiontableeditorsetfactfromworkitemparameter]]
===== Set the value of a field on a new Fact with a Work Item parameter


An Action setting the value of a new Fact's field to that of a jBPM Work Item Handler's result parameter.

[[_drools.guideddecisiontableeditoractionbrl]]
===== Action BRL fragment


A construct that allows a BRL fragment to be used in the right-hand side of a rule.
A BRL fragment is authored using the Guided Rule Editor and hence all features available in that editor can be used to define a decision table column.
When using the embedded Guided Rule Editor field values defined as "Template Keys" will form columns in the decision table.
Facts bound in the BRL fragment can be referenced by the simpler column types and vice-versa.

[NOTE]
====
The user can use "Free Form DRL" to define Action columns too.
If the User needs a place-holder for a variable in the DRL they can use the Drools Templates syntax of `@{variable-name}` for example ``$s.setName( "@{name}" )``.
====


In the following example two Template Keys have been defined and hence two columns appear in the decision table.

image::Workbench/AuthoringAssets/dtable-column-action-brl2-popup.png[align="center"]


==== Column definition hint

The definition of a column can be found by hovering the mouse pointer over the column. A popup will appear showing a _hint_ of the definition. It is considered a _hint_ as all conditions have a dummy value interpolated.

[[_drools.guideddecisiontableeditorwizard]]
=== Using a Wizard


A Wizard can also be used to assist with defining the decision table columns.

The wizard can be chosen when first electing to create a new rule.
The wizard provides a number of pages to define the table:-

* Summary
* Add Fact Patterns
* Add Constraints
* Add Actions to update facts
* Add Actions to insert facts
* Columns to expand


[[_drools.guideddecisiontableeditorselectingwizard]]
==== Selecting the wizard


The "New Wizard" dialog shows a "Use wizard" checkbox.

.Selecting the wizard
image::Workbench/AuthoringAssets/dtable-wizard1.png[align="center"]


[[_drools.guideddecisiontableeditorwizardsummarypage]]
==== Summary page


The summary page shows a few basic details about the decision table and allows the asset name to be changed.

.Summary page
image::Workbench/AuthoringAssets/dtable-wizard2.png[align="center"]


[[_drools.guideddecisiontableeditorwizardfactpatternspage]]
==== Add Fact Patterns page


This page allows Fact types to be defined that will form the "When" columns of the rules.
Fact types that are available in the model will be shown in the left-hand listbox.
Select a Fact type and use the ">>" button to add it to the list of chosen facts on the right-hand listbox.

Removal is a similar process: the Fact that is no longer required can be selected in the right-hand listbox and the "<<" button used to remove it.
All Fact types need to be bound to a variable.

.Add Fact Patterns page
image::Workbench/AuthoringAssets/dtable-wizard3.png[align="center"]


[[_drools.guideddecisiontableeditorwizardaddconstraintpage]]
==== Add Constraints page


This page allows field constraints on the Fact types the User has chosen to use in the decision table to be defined.

Fact types chosen on the previous Wizard page are listed in the right-hand listbox.
Selecting a Fact type by clicking on it will result in a list of available fields being shown in the middle listbox together with an option to create a predicate that do not require a specific field.

Fields can be added to the pattern's constraints by clicking on the field and then the ">>" button. Fields can be removed from the pattern definition by clicking on the Condition in the right-hand listbox and then the "<<" button.

All fields need to have a column header and operator.

Incomplete fields will be highlighted and a warning message displayed.
The User will be unable to finish the definition until all warnings have been resolved.

.Add Constraints page
image::Workbench/AuthoringAssets/dtable-wizard4.png[align="center"]


[[_drools.guideddecisiontableeditorwizardupdatefactspage]]
==== Add Actions to update facts page


Fact types that have been defined can be updated in the consequence, or action, part of a rule. This page allows such actions to be defined.

Fact types added to the decision table definition are listed in the left-hand listbox.
Selecting a Fact type by clicking on it will result in a list of available fields being shown in the middle listbox.

Fields that need to be updated by the rule can be added by selecting an available field and pressing the ">>" button. Fields can be removed similarly by clicking on a chosen field and then the "<<" button.

All actions require a column header.

Any incomplete actions will be highlighted and a warning message displayed.
The User will be unable to finish the definition until all warnings have been resolved.

.Add Actions to update facts page
image::Workbench/AuthoringAssets/dtable-wizard5.png[align="center"]


[[_drools.guideddecisiontableeditorwizardinsertfactspage]]
==== Add Actions to insert facts page

Actions can also be defined to insert new Facts into the Rule Engine.

A list of Fact types available in the model are listed in the left-hand listbox.
Select those the User wishes to include in the decision table definition by clicking on them and pressing the "`>>`" button between the left most listbox and that titled "Chosen patterns". 

Removal is a similar process whereby a chosen pattern can be selected and removed by pressing the "`<<`" button.

Selection of a chosen pattern presents the user with a list of available fields.
Fields that need to have values set by the action can be added by selecting them and pressing the "`>>`" button between the "Available fields" and "Chosen fields" listbox.

Removal is a similar process as already described.

New Facts need to be bound to a variable and have a column heading specified.

Incomplete Facts and\or fields will be highlighted and a warning message displayed.
The User will be unable to finish the definition until all warnings have been resolved.

.Add Actions to insert facts page
image::Workbench/AuthoringAssets/dtable-wizard6.png[align="center"]


[[_drools.guideddecisiontableeditorwizardexpandcolumnspage]]
==== Columns to expand page


This page controls how the decision table, based upon Conditions defined on the prior pages, will be created.

Condition columns defined with an optional list of permitted values can be used to create rows in the decision table. Where a number of Condition columns have been defined with lists of permitted values the resulting table will contain a row for every combination of values; i.e.
the decision table will be in expanded form.

By default all Condition columns defined with value lists will be included in the expansion however the User is able to select a sub-set of columns if so required. This can be accomplished by unticking the "Fully expand" checkbox and adding columns to the right-hand listbox.

If no expansion is required untick the "Fully expand" checkbox and ensure zero columns are added to the right-hand listbox.

.Columns to expand page
image::Workbench/AuthoringAssets/dtable-wizard7.png[align="center"]


[[_drools.guideddecisiontableeditorauditlog]]
== Audit Log


An audit log has been added to the web-guided Decision Table editor to track additions, deletions and modifications.

By default the audit log is not configured to record any events, however, users can easily select the events in which they are interested.

The audit log is persisted whenever the asset is checked in.

.An empty audit log
image::Workbench/AuthoringAssets/guided-dtable-audit-log1.png[align="center"]


Once the capture of events has been enabled all susbsequent operations are recorded.
Users are able to perform the following:-

* Record an explanatory note beside each event.
* Delete an event from the log. Event details remain in the underlying repository.


.Example of audit events
image::Workbench/AuthoringAssets/guided-dtable-audit-log2.png[align="center"]


[[_drools.guideddecisiontableeditorverification]]
== Real Time Validation and Verification


Decision tables are validated after each cell change.
If any issues are found the results will be shown in the column on the right side of the table.
Validation and verification covers the following issues:

[[_drools.guideddecisiontableeditorverificationredundancy]]
=== Redundancy


Redundancy exists between two rows when both rows execute the same actions when given the same set of facts.

Redundancy might not be a problem if the redundant rules are setting a value on an existing fact, this just sets the value twice.
Problems occur when the two rules increase a counter or add more facts into the working memory, since this causes unwanted side effects.
In both cases the other row is not needed.

[[_drools.guideddecisiontableeditorverificationsubsumption]]
=== Subsumption


Subsumption exists when one row executes the same action as another row when given the same set of facts.
The rows are not redundant since the another row is more complicated and it can fire with a set of facts that do not fire the subsumptant row.

The problems with subsumption are similar to the case with redundancy.

[[_drools.guideddecisiontableeditorverificationconflicts]]
=== Conflicts


Conflicts can exist either on a single row or between rows.

A single row conflict prevents the row actions from ever being executed.

Conflict between two rows exists when the conditions of two rules are met with a same set of facts, but the actions set fact fields to different values.
The conditions can be redundant or just subsumptant.
Conflicts are a problem because it is impossible to know what action is made last.
Conditions might set a loan to both approbed and rejected.
The end result may be different on each time the rules are ran and with each rule engine software version.

[[_drools.guideddecisiontableeditorverificationmissingrhslhs]]
=== Missing Columns


In some cases, usually by accident, the user can delete all the condition or action columns.
When the conditions are removed all the actions are executed and when the actions columns are missing the rows do nothing.
