= Session Clock
:imagesdir: ..


Reasoning over time requires a reference clock.
Just to mention one example, if a rule reasons over the average price of a given stock over the last 60 minutes, how the engine knows what stock price changes happened over the last 60 minutes in order to calculate the average? The obvious response is: by comparing the timestamp of the events with the "current time". How the engine knows what **time is now**? Again, obviously, by querying the Session Clock.

The session clock implements a strategy pattern, allowing different types of clocks to be plugged and used by the engine.
This is very important because the engine may be running in an elements of different scenarios that may require different clock implementations.
Just to mention a few:

* *Rules testing:* testing always requires a controlled environment, and when the tests include rules with temporal constraints, it is necessary to not only control the input rules and facts, but also the flow of time.
* *Regular execution:* usually, when running rules in production, the application will require a real time clock that allows the rules engine to react immediately to the time progression.
* *Special environments:* specific environments may have specific requirements on time control. Cluster environments may require clock synchronization through heart beats, or JEE environments may require the use of an AppServer provided clock, etc.
* **Rules replay or simulation: **to replay scenarios or simulate scenarios it is necessary that the application also controls the flow of time.
