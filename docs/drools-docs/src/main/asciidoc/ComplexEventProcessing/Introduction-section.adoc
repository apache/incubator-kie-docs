= Complex Event Processing


There is no broadly accepted definition on the term Complex Event Processing.
The term Event by itself is frequently overloaded and used to refer to several different things, depending on the context it is used.
Defining terms is not the goal of this guide and as so, lets adopt a loose definition that, although not formal, will allow us to proceed with a common understanding.

So, in the scope of this guide:

[IMPORTANT]
====

(((Event)))**Event**, is a record of a significant change of state in the application domain at a given point in time.
====


For instance, on a Stock Broker application, when a sale operation is executed, it causes a change of state in the domain.
This change of state can be observed on several entities in the domain, like the price of the securities that changed to match the value of the operation, the ownership of the traded assets that changed from the seller to the buyer, the balance of the accounts from both seller and buyer that are credited and debited, etc.
Depending on how the domain is modelled, this change of state may be represented by a single event, multiple atomic events or even hierarchies of correlated events.
In any case, in the context of this guide, Event is the record of the change of a particular piece of data in the domain.

Events are processed by computer systems since they were invented, and throughout the history, systems responsible for that were given different names and different methodologies were employed.
It wasn't until the 90's though, that a more focused work started on EDA (Event Driven Architecture) with a more formal definition on the requirements and goals for event processing.
Old messaging systems started to change to address such requirements and new systems started to be developed with the single purpose of event processing.
Two trends were born under the names of Event Stream Processing and Complex Event Processing.

In the very beginnings, Event Stream Processing was focused on the capabilities of processing streams of events in (near) real time, while the main focus of Complex Event Processing was on the correlation and composition of atomic events into complex (compound) events.
An important (maybe the most important) milestone was the publishing of Dr.
David Luckham's book "The Power of Events" in 2002.
In the book, Dr Luckham introduces the concept of Complex Event Processing and how it can be used to enhance systems that deal with events.
Over the years, both trends converged to a common understanding and today these systems are all referred to as CEP systems.

This is a very simplistic explanation to a really complex and fertile field of research, but sets a high level and common understanding of the concepts that this guide will introduce.

The current understanding of what Complex Event Processing is may be briefly described as the following quote from Wikipedia:

[quote, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_event_processing]
____
"**Complex Event Processing**, or CEP, is primarily an event processing concept that deals with the task of processing multiple events with the goal of identifying the meaningful events within the event cloud.
CEP employs techniques such as detection of complex patterns of many events, event correlation and abstraction, event hierarchies, and relationships between events such as causality, membership, and timing, and event-driven processes."

In other words, CEP is about detecting and selecting the interesting events (and only them) from an event cloud, finding their relationships and inferring new data from them and their relationships.

[NOTE]
====
For the remaining of this guide, we will use the terms  *Complex Event Processing* and *CEP* as a broad reference for any of  the related technologies and techniques, including but not limited to, CEP, Complex Event Processing, ESP, Event Stream Processing and Event Processing in general.
