= Explicit expiration offset


The first way of allowing the engine to calculate the window of interest for a given event type is by explicitly setting it.
To do that, just use the declare statement and define an expiration for the fact type:

.explicitly defining an expiration offset of 30 minutes forStockTick events
====
[source]
----
declare StockTick
    @expires( 30m )
end
----
====


The above example declares an expiration offset of 30 minutes for StockTick events.
After that time, assuming no rule still needs the event, the engine will expire and remove the event from the session automatically.



[IMPORTANT]
====
An explicit expiration policy for a given event type overrides any inferred expiration offset for that same type.
