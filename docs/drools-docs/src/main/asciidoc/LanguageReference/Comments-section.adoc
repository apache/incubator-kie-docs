= Comments
:imagesdir: ..


Comments are sections of text that are ignored by the rule engine.
They are stripped out when they are encountered, except inside semantic code blocks, like the RHS of a rule.

== Single line comment


To create single line comments, you can use '//'. The parser will ignore anything in the line after the comment symbol.
Example:

[source]
----
rule "Testing Comments"
when
    // this is a single line comment
    eval( true ) // this is a comment in the same line of a pattern
then
    // this is a comment inside a semantic code block
end
----

[WARNING]
====
'#' for comments has been removed.

== Multi-line comment

Multi-line comments are used to comment blocks of text, both in and outside semantic code blocks.
Example:

[source]
----
rule "Test Multi-line Comments"
when
    /* this is a multi-line comment
       in the left hand side of a rule */
    eval( true )
then
    /* and this is a multi-line comment
       in the right hand side of a rule */
end
