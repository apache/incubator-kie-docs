= Hello World

Name: Hello World
Main class: org.drools.examples.helloworld.HelloWorldExample
Module: drools-examples
Type: Java application
Rules file: HelloWorld.drl
Objective: demonstrate basic rules in use
----


The "Hello World" example shows a simple application using rules, written both using the MVEL and the Java dialects.

This example demonstrates how to create and use a ``KieSession``.
Also, audit logging and debug outputs are shown, which is omitted from other examples as it's all very similar. 

The following code snippet shows how the session is created with only 3 lines of code. 

.HelloWorld: Creating the KieSession
====
[source,java]
----
        KieServices ks = KieServices.Factory.get(); // <1>
        KieContainer kc = ks.getKieClasspathContainer(); // <2>
        KieSession ksession = kc.newKieSession("HelloWorldKS"); // <3>
----
<1> Obtains the KieServices factory. This is the main interface applications use to interact with 
    the engine.
<2> Creates a KieContainer from the project classpath. This will look for a */META-INF/kmodule.xml* 
    file to configure and instantiate the KieModule into the KieContainer.
<3> Creates a session based on the named "HelloWorldKS" session configuration.
====

Drools has an event model that exposes much of what's happening internally.
Two default debug listeners are supplied, `DebugAgendaEventListener` and `DebugWorkingMemoryEventListener` which print out debug event information to the `System.err` stream displayed in the Console window.
Adding listeners to a Session is trivial, as shown in the next snippet.
The `KieRuntimeLogger` provides execution auditing, the result of which can be viewed in a graphical viewer.
The logger is actually a specialised implementation built on the `Agenda` and `RuleRuntime` listeners.
When the engine has finished executing, `logger.close()` must be called.

Most of the examples use the Audit logging features of Drools to record execution flow for later inspection.

.HelloWorld: Event logging and Auditing
====
[source,java]
----
        // The application can also setup listeners
        ksession.addEventListener( new DebugAgendaEventListener() );
        ksession.addEventListener( new DebugRuleRuntimeEventListener() );

        // To setup a file based audit logger, uncomment the next line 
        // KieRuntimeLogger logger = ks.getLoggers().newFileLogger( ksession, "./helloworld" );
        
        // To setup a ThreadedFileLogger, so that the audit view reflects events whilst debugging,
        // uncomment the next line
        // KieRuntimeLogger logger = ks.getLoggers().newThreadedFileLogger( ksession, "./helloworld", 1000 );

The single class used in this example is very simple.
It has two fields: the message, which is a `String` and the status which can be one of the two integers `HELLO` or ``GOODBYE``.

.HelloWorld example: Message Class
====
[source,java]
----
public static class Message {
    public static final int HELLO   = 0;
    public static final int GOODBYE = 1;

    private String          message;
    private int             status; 
    ...
}
----

A single `Message` object is created with the message text "Hello World" and the status `HELLO` and then inserted into the engine, at which point `fireAllRules()` is executed. 

.HelloWorld: Execution
====
[source,java]
----
        // The application can insert facts into the session
        final Message message = new Message();
        message.setMessage( "Hello World" );
        message.setStatus( Message.HELLO );
        ksession.insert( message );

        // and fire the rules
        ksession.fireAllRules();
----
====


To execute the example as a Java application:

. Open the class `org.drools.examples.helloworld.HelloWorldExample` in your Eclipse IDE
. Right-click the class and select "Run as..." and then "Java application"


If we put a breakpoint on the `fireAllRules()` method and select the `ksession` variable, we can see that the "Hello World" rule is already activate on the Agenda.

The application print outs go to to `System.out` while the debug listener print outs go to ``System.err``.

                   tuple=[fid:1:2:org.drools.examples.helloworld.HelloWorldExample$Message@17cec96]]

The actual rules are inside the file [path]_src/main/resources/org/drools/examples/helloworld/HelloWorld.drl_
:

.HelloWorld: rule "Hello World"
====
[source]
----
rule "Hello World"
      dialect "mvel"
  when
      m : Message( status == Message.HELLO, message : message )
  then
      System.out.println( message ); 
      modify ( m ) { message = "Goodbye cruel world",
                     status = Message.GOODBYE };
end
----
====


The LHS (after ``when``) section of the rule states that it will be activated for each `Message` object inserted into the Rule Runtime whose status is ``Message.HELLO``.
Besides that, two variable bindings are created: the variable `message` is bound to the `message` attribute and the variable `m` is bound to the matched `Message` object itself.

The RHS (after ``then``) or consequence part of the rule is written using the MVEL expression language, as declared by the rule's attribute ``dialect``.
After printing the content of the bound variable `message` to ``System.out``, the rule changes the values of the `message` and `status` attributes of the `Message` object bound to ``m``.
This is done using MVEL's `modify` statement, which allows you to apply a block of assignments in one statement, with the engine being automatically notified of the changes at the end of the block.

It is possible to set a breakpoint into the DRL, on the `modify` call, and inspect the Agenda view again during the execution of the rule's consequence.
This time we start the execution via "Debug As" and "Drools application" and not by running a "Java application":

. Open the class `org.drools.examples.HelloWorld` in your Eclipse IDE.
. Right-click the class and select "Debug as..." and then "Drools application".


Now we can see that the other rule ``"Good Bye"``, which uses the Java dialect, is activated and placed on the Agenda.

.Hello World: rule "Hello World" Agenda View
image::Examples/HelloWorldExample/helloworld_agenda2.png[align="center"]


The "Good Bye" rule, which specifies the "java" dialect, is similar to the "Hello World" rule except that it matches `Message` objects whose  status is ``Message.GOODBYE``.

.HelloWorld: rule "Good Bye"
====
[source]
----
rule "Good Bye"
      dialect "java"
  when
      Message( status == Message.GOODBYE, message : message )
  then
      System.out.println( message ); 
end

The Java code that instantiates the `KieRuntimeLogger` creates an audit log file that can be loaded into the Audit view.
The Audit view is used in many of the examples to demonstrate the example execution flow.
In the view screen shot below we can see that the object is inserted, which creates an activation for the "Hello World" rule; the activation is then executed which updates the `Message` object causing the "Good Bye" rule to activate; finally the "Good Bye" rule also executes.
Selecting an event in the Audit view highlights the origin event in green; therefore the "Activation created" event is highlighted in green as the origin of the "Activation executed" event.
