== Stateless Knowledge Session


So where do we get started? There are so many use cases and so much functionality in a rule engine such as Drools that it becomes beguiling.
Have no fear my intrepid adventurer, the complexity is layered and you can ease yourself in with simple use cases.

Stateless session, not utilising inference, forms the simplest use case.
A stateless session can be called like a function passing it some data and then receiving some results back.
Some common use cases for stateless sessions are, but not limited to:

* Validation
** Is this person eligible for a mortgage?
* Calculation
** Compute a mortgage premium.
* Routing and Filtering
** Filter incoming messages, such as emails, into folders.
** Send incoming messages to a destination.


So let's start with a very simple example using a driving license application.

[source,java]
----
public class Applicant {
    private String name;
    private int age;
    private boolean valid;
    // getter and setter methods here
}
----


Now that we have our data model we can write our first rule.
We assume that the application uses rules to reject invalid applications.
As this is a simple validation use case we will add a single rule to disqualify any applicant younger than 18.

[source]
----
package com.company.license

rule "Is of valid age"
when
    $a : Applicant( age < 18 )
then
    $a.setValid( false );
end
----


To make the engine aware of data, so it can be processed against the rules, we have to _insert_ the data, much like with a database.
When the Applicant instance is inserted into the engine it is evaluated against the constraints of the rules, in this case just two constraints for one rule.
We say _two_ because the type Applicant is the first object type constraint, and `age < 18` is the second field constraint.
An object type constraint plus its zero or more field constraints is referred to as a pattern.
When an inserted instance satisfies both the object type constraint and all the field constraints, it is said to be matched.
The `$a` is a binding variable which permits us to reference the matched object in the consequence.
There its properties can be updated.
The dollar character ('$') is optional, but it helps to differentiate variable names from field names.
The process of matching patterns against the inserted data is, not surprisingly, often referred to as __pattern matching__.

To use this rule it is necessary to put it a Drools file, just a plain text file with .drl extension , short for "Drools Rule Language". Let's call this file licenseApplication.drl, and store it in a Kie Project.
A Kie Project has the structure of a normal Maven project with an additional file (kmodule.xml) defining the ``KieBase``s and ``KieSession``s that can be created.
This file has to be placed in the resources/META-INF folder of the Maven project while all the other Drools artifacts, such as the licenseApplication.drl containing the former rule, must be stored in the resources folder or in any other subfolder under it.

Since meaningful defaults have been provided for all configuration aspects, the simplest kmodule.xml file can contain just an empty kmodule tag like the following:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<kmodule xmlns="http://www.drools.org/xsd/kmodule"/>
----


At this point it is possible to create a `KieContainer` that reads the files to be built, from the classpath.

[source,java]
----
KieServices kieServices = KieServices.Factory.get();
KieContainer kContainer = kieServices.getKieClasspathContainer();
----


The above code snippet compiles all the DRL files found on the classpath and put the result of this compilation, a ``KieModule``, in the ``KieContainer``.
If there are no errors, we are now ready to create our session from the `KieContainer` and execute against some data:

[source,java]
----
StatelessKieSession kSession = kContainer.newStatelessKieSession();
Applicant applicant = new Applicant( "Mr John Smith", 16 );
assertTrue( applicant.isValid() );
ksession.execute( applicant );
assertFalse( applicant.isValid() );
----


The preceding code executes the data against the rules.
Since the applicant is under the age of 18, the application is marked as invalid.

So far we've only used a single instance, but what if we want to use more than one? We can execute against any object implementing Iterable, such as a collection.
Let's add another class called ``Application``, which has the date of the application, and we'll also move the boolean valid field to the `Application` class.

[source,java]
----
public class Applicant {
    private String name;
    private int age;
    // getter and setter methods here
}

public class Application {
    private Date dateApplied;
    private boolean valid;
    // getter and setter methods here
}
----


We will also add another rule to validate that the application was made within a period of time.

[source]
----
package com.company.license

rule "Is of valid age"
when
    Applicant( age < 18 )
    $a : Application()     
then
    $a.setValid( false );
end

rule "Application was made this year"
when
    $a : Application( dateApplied > "01-jan-2009" )     
then
    $a.setValid( false );
end
----


Unfortunately a Java array does not implement the `Iterable` interface, so we have to use the JDK converter method ``Arrays.asList(...)``.
The code shown below executes against an iterable list, where all collection elements are inserted before any matched rules are fired.

[source,java]
----
StatelessKieSession kSession = kContainer.newStatelessKieSession();
Applicant applicant = new Applicant( "Mr John Smith", 16 );
Application application = new Application();
assertTrue( application.isValid() );
ksession.execute( Arrays.asList( new Object[] { application, applicant } ) );
assertFalse( application.isValid() );
----


The two execute methods `execute(Object object)` and `execute(Iterable objects)` are actually convenience methods for the interface ``BatchExecutor``'s method ``execute(Command command)``.

The `KieCommands` commands factory, obtainable from the `KieServices` like all other factories of the KIE API, is used to create commands, so that the following is equivalent to ``execute(Iterable it)``:

[source,java]
----
ksession.execute( kieServices.getCommands().newInsertElements( Arrays.asList( new Object[] { application, applicant } ) );
----


Batch Executor and Command Factory are particularly useful when working with multiple Commands and with output identifiers for obtaining results.

[source,java]
----
KieCommands kieCommands = kieServices.getCommands();
List<Command> cmds = new ArrayList<Command>();
cmds.add( kieCommands.newInsert( new Person( "Mr John Smith" ), "mrSmith", true, null ) );
cmds.add( kieCommands.newInsert( new Person( "Mr John Doe" ), "mrDoe", true, null ) );
BatchExecutionResults results = ksession.execute( kieCommands.newBatchExecution( cmds ) );
assertEquals( new Person( "Mr John Smith" ), results.getValue( "mrSmith" ) );
----

`CommandFactory` supports many other Commands that can be used in the `BatchExecutor` like ``StartProcess``, ``Query``, and ``SetGlobal``.

== Stateful Knowledge Session


Stateful Sessions are long lived and allow iterative changes over time.
Some common use cases for Stateful Sessions are, but not limited to:

* Monitoring
** Stock market monitoring and analysis for semi-automatic buying.
* Diagnostics
** Fault finding, medical diagnostics
* Logistics
** Parcel tracking and delivery provisioning
* Compliance
** Validation of legality for market trades.


In contrast to a Stateless Session, the `dispose()` method must be called afterwards to ensure there are no memory leaks, as the KieBase contains references to Stateful Knowledge Sessions when they are created.
Since Stateful Knowledge Session is the most commonly used session type it is just named `KieSession` in the KIE API. `KieSession` also supports the `BatchExecutor` interface, like ``StatelessKieSession``, the only difference being that the `FireAllRules` command is not automatically called at the end for a Stateful Session.

We illustrate the monitoring use case with an example for raising a fire alarm.
Using just four classes, we represent rooms in a house, each of which has one sprinkler.
If a fire starts in a room, we represent that with a single `Fire` instance.

[source,java]
----
public class Room {
    private String name
    // getter and setter methods here
}
public class Sprinkler {
    private Room room;
    private boolean on;
    // getter and setter methods here
}
public class Fire {
    private Room room;
    // getter and setter methods here
}
public class Alarm {
}
----


In the previous section on Stateless Sessions the concepts of inserting and matching against data were introduced.
That example assumed that only a single instance of each object type was ever inserted and thus only used literal constraints.
However, a house has many rooms, so rules must express relationships between objects, such as a sprinkler being in a certain room.
This is best done by using a binding variable as a constraint in a pattern.
This "join" process results in what is called cross products, which are covered in the next section.

When a fire occurs an instance of the `Fire` class is created, for that room, and inserted into the session.
The rule uses a binding on the `room` field of the `Fire` object to constrain matching to the sprinkler for that room, which is currently off.
When this rule fires and the consequence is executed the sprinkler is turned on.

[source]
----
rule "When there is a fire turn on the sprinkler"
when
    Fire($room : room)
    $sprinkler : Sprinkler( room == $room, on == false )
then
    modify( $sprinkler ) { setOn( true ) };
    System.out.println( "Turn on the sprinkler for room " + $room.getName() );
end
----


Whereas the Stateless Session uses standard Java syntax to modify a field, in the above rule we use the `modify` statement, which acts as a sort of "with" statement.
It may contain a series of comma separated Java expressions, i.e., calls to setters of the object selected by the `modify` statement's control expression.
This modifies the data, and makes the engine aware of those changes so it can reason over them once more.
This process is called inference, and it's essential for the working of a Stateful Session.
Stateless Sessions typically do not use inference, so the engine does not need to be aware of changes to data.
Inference can also be turned off explicitly by using the __sequential mode__.

So far we have rules that tell us when matching data exists, but what about when it does _not_ exist? How do we determine that a fire has been extinguished, i.e., that there isn't a `Fire` object any more? Previously the constraints have been sentences according to Propositional Logic, where the engine is constraining against individual instances.
Drools also has support for First Order Logic that allows you to look at sets of data.
A pattern under the keyword `not` matches when something does not exist.
The rule given below turns the sprinkler off as soon as the fire in that room has disappeared.

[source]
----
rule "When the fire is gone turn off the sprinkler"
when
    $room : Room( )
    $sprinkler : Sprinkler( room == $room, on == true )
    not Fire( room == $room )
then
    modify( $sprinkler ) { setOn( false ) };
    System.out.println( "Turn off the sprinkler for room " + $room.getName() );
end
----


While there is one sprinkler per room, there is just a single alarm for the building.
An `Alarm` object is created when a fire occurs, but only one `Alarm` is needed for the entire building, no matter how many fires occur.
Previously `not` was introduced to match the absence of a fact; now we use its complement `exists` which matches for one or more instances of some category.

[source]
----
rule "Raise the alarm when we have one or more fires"
when
    exists Fire()
then
    insert( new Alarm() );
    System.out.println( "Raise the alarm" );
end
----


Likewise, when there are no fires we want to remove the alarm, so the `not` keyword can be used again.

[source]
----
rule "Cancel the alarm when all the fires have gone"
when
    not Fire()
    $alarm : Alarm()
then
    delete( $alarm );
    System.out.println( "Cancel the alarm" );
end
----


Finally there is a general health status message that is printed when the application first starts and after the alarm is removed and all sprinklers have been turned off.

[source]
----
rule "Status output when things are ok"
when
    not Alarm()
    not Sprinkler( on == true ) 
then
    System.out.println( "Everything is ok" );
end
----


As we did in the Stateless Session example, the above rules should be placed in a single DRL file and saved into the resouces folder of your Maven project or any of its subfolder.
As before, we can then obtain a `KieSession` from the ``KieContainer``.
The only difference is that this time we create a Stateful Session, whereas before we created a Stateless Session.

[source,java]
----
KieServices kieServices = KieServices.Factory.get();
KieContainer kContainer = kieServices.getKieClasspathContainer();
KieSession ksession = kContainer.newKieSession();
----


With the session created it is now possible to iteratively work with it over time.
Four `Room` objects are created and inserted, as well as one `Sprinkler` object for each room.
At this point the engine has done all of its matching, but no rules have fired yet.
Calling `ksession.fireAllRules()` allows the matched rules to fire, but without a fire that will just produce the health message.

[source,java]
----
String[] names = new String[]{"kitchen", "bedroom", "office", "livingroom"};
Map<String,Room> name2room = new HashMap<String,Room>();
for( String name: names ){
    Room room = new Room( name );
    name2room.put( name, room );
    ksession.insert( room );
    Sprinkler sprinkler = new Sprinkler( room );
    ksession.insert( sprinkler );
}

ksession.fireAllRules();
----

[source]
----
> Everything is ok
----


We now create two fires and insert them; this time a reference is kept for the returned ``FactHandle``.
A Fact Handle is an internal engine reference to the inserted instance and allows instances to be retracted or modified at a later point in time.
With the fires now in the engine, once `fireAllRules()` is called, the alarm is raised and the respective sprinklers are turned on.

[source,java]
----
Fire kitchenFire = new Fire( name2room.get( "kitchen" ) );
Fire officeFire = new Fire( name2room.get( "office" ) );

FactHandle kitchenFireHandle = ksession.insert( kitchenFire );
FactHandle officeFireHandle = ksession.insert( officeFire );

ksession.fireAllRules();
----

[source]
----
> Raise the alarm
> Turn on the sprinkler for room kitchen
> Turn on the sprinkler for room office
----


After a while the fires will be put out and the `Fire` instances are retracted.
This results in the sprinklers being turned off, the alarm being cancelled, and eventually the health message is printed again.

[source,java]
----
ksession.delete( kitchenFireHandle );
ksession.delete( officeFireHandle );

ksession.fireAllRules();
----

[source]
----
> Cancel the alarm
> Turn off the sprinkler for room office
> Turn off the sprinkler for room kitchen
> Everything is ok
----


Everyone still with me? That wasn't so hard and already I'm hoping you can start to see the value and power of a declarative rule system.

== Methods versus Rules


People often confuse methods and rules, and new rule users often ask, "How do I call a rule?" After the last section, you are now feeling like a rule expert and the answer to that is obvious, but let's summarize the differences nonetheless.

[source,java]
----
public void helloWorld(Person person) {
    if ( person.getName().equals( "Chuck" ) ) {
        System.out.println( "Hello Chuck" );
    }
}
----

* Methods are called directly.
* Specific instances are passed.
* One call results in a single execution.


[source]
----
rule "Hello World" when
    Person( name == "Chuck" )
then
    System.out.println( "Hello Chuck" );
end
----

* Rules execute by matching against any data as long it is inserted into the engine.
* Rules can never be called directly.
* Specific instances cannot be passed to a rule.
* Depending on the matches, a rule may fire once or several times, or not at all.


== Cross Products


Earlier the term "cross product" was mentioned, which is the result of a join.
Imagine for a moment that the data from the fire alarm example were used in combination with the following rule where there are no field constraints:

[source]
----
rule "Show Sprinklers" when
    $room : Room()
    $sprinkler : Sprinkler()
then
    System.out.println( "room:" + $room.getName() +
                        " sprinkler:" + $sprinkler.getRoom().getName() );
end
----


In SQL terms this would be like doing `select * from Room,
    Sprinkler` and every row in the Room table would be joined with every row in the Sprinkler table resulting in the following output:

[source]
----
room:office sprinkler:office
room:office sprinkler:kitchen
room:office sprinkler:livingroom
room:office sprinkler:bedroom
room:kitchen sprinkler:office
room:kitchen sprinkler:kitchen
room:kitchen sprinkler:livingroom
room:kitchen sprinkler:bedroom
room:livingroom sprinkler:office
room:livingroom sprinkler:kitchen
room:livingroom sprinkler:livingroom
room:livingroom sprinkler:bedroom
room:bedroom sprinkler:office
room:bedroom sprinkler:kitchen
room:bedroom sprinkler:livingroom
room:bedroom sprinkler:bedroom
----


These cross products can obviously become huge, and they may very well contain spurious data.
The size of cross products is often the source of performance problems for new rule authors.
From this it can be seen that it's always desirable to constrain the cross products, which is done with the variable constraint.

[source]
----
rule
when
    $room : Room()
    $sprinkler : Sprinkler( room == $room )
then
    System.out.println( "room:" + $room.getName() +
                        " sprinkler:" + $sprinkler.getRoom().getName() );
end
----


This results in just four rows of data, with the correct Sprinkler for each Room.
In SQL (actually HQL) the corresponding query would be ``select * from Room, Sprinkler where Room ==
    Sprinkler.room``.

[source]
----
room:office sprinkler:office
room:kitchen sprinkler:kitchen
room:livingroom sprinkler:livingroom
room:bedroom sprinkler:bedroom
----
