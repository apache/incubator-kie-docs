= Functions
:imagesdir: ..

FEEL allows the creation of functions through function literals (or anonymous functions). E.g., the following
FEEL expression creates a function that adds the parameters `a` and `b` and returns the result:

```
function(a, b) a + b
```

There is no explicit way of declaring a variable as a `function` in the DMN specification. Drools extends the
DMN built in types with the function type for that reason.

WARNING: a `function` datatype is an extension to the specification and is subject to change if the DMN specification
provides a standard way to declare functions in the future.
