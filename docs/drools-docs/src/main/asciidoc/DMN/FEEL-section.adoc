:imagesdir: ..

FEEL is an expression language defined by the DMN specification. The name stands
for *Friendly Enough Expression Language* and it aims at being an expression language
that is easy enough that any user capable of authoring expressions in a spreadsheet
program like Excel or OpenOffice would be capable of writing FEEL expressions.

DMN completely defines the semantics of FEEL execution and any expression that does
not invoke externally defined functions should produce the exact same result in any
compliant implementation. FEEL language is side-effect free and any externally defined
function should be side-effect free as well.
