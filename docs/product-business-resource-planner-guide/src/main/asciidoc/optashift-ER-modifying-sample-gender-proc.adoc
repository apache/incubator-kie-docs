= Sample modification: a spot can require employees of a particular gender
With this sample modification, the user sets the gender of every employee (male, female, or other). When creating required employees for a sift (time slot and position), the user has the option of setting the required gender. In this case, only employees of this gender can be assigned. 

This option is useful, for example, if a female nurse or prison guard is required on every shift.

The new rule relies on additional information that the user must add. Therefore, you must modify the user interface and data structures. It is an example of a complicated change in the starter application.

You can review the full change and apply it by using the ??? patch file, available from ???

NOTE: The following procedure is an overview of the changes provided by the patch file. The source code for the changes is not quoted in this document. Refer to the patch file for the source code.

.Procedure

. In the `optashift-employee-rostering-server` package, in the `src/main/java/org/optaplanner/openshift/employeerostering/server/roster/RosterGenerator.java` class, add generaton of gender when generating employees.

. In the `optashift-employee-rostering-shared` package, in the `src/main/java/org/optaplanner/openshift/employeerostering/shared/employee/Employee.java` file, add the new `gender` field and a setter and getter for it. Modify the constructor method to set the gender.

. In the `optashift-employee-rostering-shared` package, in the `src/main/java/org/optaplanner/openshift/employeerostering/shared/shift/Shift.java` file, add the new `requiredGender` field and a setter and getter for it. Modify the constructor method to set the required gender.

. In the `optashift-employee-rostering-shared` package, in the `src/main/java/org/optaplanner/openshift/employeerostering/shared/shift/view/ShiftView.java` file, add the new `requiredGender` field and a setter and getter for it. Modify the constructor method to set the required gender.

. In the `optashift-employee-rostering-server` package, in the `src/main/java/org/optaplanner/openshift/employeerostering/server/shift/ShiftRestServiceImpl.java` file, modify the instantiation of the Shift class to take the new gender field into account.

. Modify the user interface in the `optashift-employee-rostering-gwtui` package to set the gender for an employee and to set the required gender when adding a required employee in the spot roster view panel. 

. When all the data is available, add a simple rule to exclude mismatched required gender to the  `src/main/resources/org/optaplanner/openshift/employeerostering/server/solver/employeeRosteringScoreRules.drl` file of the `optashift-employee-rostering-shared` package:
+
[source,java]
----
rule "Mismatched gender for shift"
    when
        Shift(
            employee != null,
            requiredGender != null,
            employee.getGender() != requiredGender)
    then
        scoreHolder.addHardConstraintMatch(kcontext, -10);
end
