= Phase Configuration
:imagesdir: ../..

Planner splits the solving process into multiple phases.
Every phase represents a single optimization algorithm run, which consumes a result returned by the previous phase.
For example, a Construction Heuristic phase is usually placed before a Local Search phase to provide a good initial solution that the Local Search further optimizes.

[NOTE]
====
By default, the Solver uses a single Construction Heuristic phase followed by a Local Search phase.
