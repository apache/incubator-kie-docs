= Create a Solver in {CENTRAL}

The Solver editor creates a solver configuration that can be run in the Execution Solver or plain Java code after the KJAR is deployed.

You can edit and create Solver configurations in {CENTRAL}.

.Prerequisite
{PRODUCT} has been downloaded and installed. Your project has been designed and deployed with all relevant assets configured. 
 
This example uses the provided Employee Rostering sample project to demonstrate Solver features.

.Procedure

. In {CENTRAL}, click *Menu* -> *Projects*, and click on your project to open it.
. In the *Assets* perspective, click *Add Asset* -> *Solver configuration*
. In the *Create new Solver configuration* window, type a name for your Solver and click *Ok*.
+
This opens the *Solver configuration* editor.

. In the *Score Director Factory* configuration section, define a knowledge base that contains scoring rule definitions.
.. Select one of the knowledge sessions defined within the knowledge base. 
+ 
The sessions can be managed in the *Project* perspective in {CENTRAL} by clicking *Menu* -> *Projects*.
+
[NOTE]
====
{PLANNER} uses a default knowledge session if none is specified.

. Click the *Validate* button to validate the Solver configuration.
This will actually build a Solver, which will notify you of most issues in your project without the need to deploy and run it.

By default, the Solver configuration automatically scans for all planning entities and planning solution classes.
If none are found (or too many), validation fails.
