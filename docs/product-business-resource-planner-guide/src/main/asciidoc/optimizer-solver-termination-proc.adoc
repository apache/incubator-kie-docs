[id='optimizer-solver-termination-proc']
= Configure Solver termination

By default, the planning engine is given an unlimited time period to solve a problem instance.

This might be enforced by some scenarios (for example, real time planning), it is useful to have a mechanism to control total duration of the solving process.

Refer to https://docs.jboss.org/optaplanner/release/latestFinal/optaplanner-docs/html_single/#termination[OptaPlanner documentation]
for more information on supported termination types.

[NOTE]
====
The Solver can be terminated manually using the {KIE_SERVER} REST API.

.Prerequisite
You have deployed a project and created a Solver in {CENTRAL}.

.Procedure
. Open the *Solver editor*, 
. In the *Termination* section, click *Add* to create new termination element within the selected logical group.
. Select a termination type from the drop-down list. This is added as an input field in the termination configuration.
+
Termination elements are organized into a tree structure. 

The editor supports definition of logical groups (represented by termination type *Nested termination*), which join multiple termination elements using logical operators (*And*/*Or*).
The scope of the operator is limited by the logical group in which it is defined.

Click *Remove* to remove the termination element from the termination tree. 

[NOTE]
====
Removing the root element of a logical group removes its child elements.
