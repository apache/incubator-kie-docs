= Configuring a planning entity difficulty comparator
:imagesdir: ../..

Specified on `Planning Entity` level, a difficulty comparator provides a way to determine which planning entities are more difficult to plan.
This helps optimization algorithms to work in an efficient manner.
Refer to https://docs.jboss.org/optaplanner/release/latest/optaplanner-docs/html_single/index.html#planningEntityDifficulty[OptaPlanner documentation] for more details.

.Prerequisite
You have selected *Planning Entity* on a data object in the *Data Object* editor and the difficulty comparator definition tool is available in the {PLANNER} Domain editor in the *Data Object* perspective.

.Procedure
. Click *Add condition* to add new sorting criteria for given planning entity.
. Once the condition is added, click *Add field* to select fields that will be used for difficulty comparison.
+
There are two types of fields:

* *Basic* - value types (e.g. number, String)
* *Data object* - complex types having nested attributes
+
Data object types allow nesting deep into object hierarchy until a basic type is encountered. When this occurs, the *Add field* button is no longer displayed.

+
Sorting criteria are ordered. The ones defined first are prioritized when {PLANNER} engine resolves planning entity difficulty.

. To remove a field from the sorting criteria, click the *x* icon within the label. If the field is of type `Data object`, removing it will remove all its children as well.

* Click *Arrow up*, *Arrow down* to change the priority of the criterion by moving it up/down.
* Select *Sort order* icon to define whether the planning entity criteria is sorted in ascending or descending order.
