= Solver Editor
:imagesdir: ../..

The solver editor creates a solver configuration that can be run in the Execution Solver or plain Java code after the kjar is deployed.

[NOTE]
====
To see and use this editor, the user needs to have the ``Resource Planner`` <<_wb.userandgroupmgmt,permission>>.
====

Use the *Validate* button to validate the solver configuration.
This will actually build a Solver, so most issues in your project will present itself then, without the need to deploy and run it.

By default, the solver configuration automatically scans for all planning entities and planning solution classes.
If none are found (or too many), validation fails.
