= Installing the {PLANNER} engine in your application

Use the following procedure to use {PLANNER} with Maven, and similarly if you use Gradle, Ivy, or Buildr:

.Prerequisite

Get the {PLANNER} JARs from the https://maven.repository.redhat.com/ga/org/optaplanner[Red Hat JBoss Maven Repository].

.Procedure
. Identify the latest version by checking the https://maven.repository.redhat.com/ga/org/optaplanner[Red Hat JBoss Maven Repository].
. Add a dependency to `optaplanner-core` in your project's `pom.xml` :
+

[source,xml]
----

  <dependency>
      <groupId>org.optaplanner</groupId>
      <artifactId>optaplanner-core</artifactId>
      <version>...</version>
  </dependency>
----
. (Optional) Add any other Business Optimizer engine modules that you require, such as the `optaplanner-persistence-jpa` or `optaplanner-persistence-xstream` integration modules. 
+
Note that the `optaplanner-benchmark` module is included as part of the engine, however, it is recommended to be used as a separate module, as demonstrated in the this https://github.com/kiegroup/optashift-employee-rostering/tree/master/optashift-employee-rostering-benchmark[Employee Rostering module]. This is to avoid leaking the `optaplanner-benchmark` into the `.war` file.

If you use Ant (without Ivy):

.Procedure
. Copy all of the JARs from the downloaded .zip file `binaries` directory.
. Manually verify that your classpath does not contain duplicate JARs.
+
[NOTE]
====
The downloaded .zip file `binaries` directory contains far more JARs then `optaplanner-core` actually uses.
It also contains the JARs used by other modules, such as `optaplanner-benchmark`.

Check the Maven repository `pom.xml` files to determine the minimal dependency set for a specific version of a specific module.
