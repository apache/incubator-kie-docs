= Installing the {PLANNER} engine in your application

{PLANNER} can be installed using Maven or other applications, such as Gradle, Ivy, or Buildr.

.Prerequisite
The {PRODUCT} has been downloaded and installed from the https://access.redhat.com[Red Hat Customer Portal]. See Installing Decision Manager for more information about installing {PRODUCT}.

.Procedure
. Get the {PLANNER} JARs at the https://maven.repository.redhat.com/ga/optaplanner[Red Hat JBoss Maven Repository].
. Identify the latest version by checking the https://maven.repository.redhat.com/ga/optaplanner[Red Hat JBoss Maven Repository].
. Add a dependency to `optaplanner-core` in your project's `pom.xml`:
+

[source,xml]
----

  <dependency>
      <groupId>org.optaplanner</groupId>
      <artifactId>optaplanner-core</artifactId>
      <version>...</version>
  </dependency>
----


Alternatively, if you are using Ant (without Ivy) you can install the engine by copying all of the JARs from the downloaded ZIP's `binaries` directory. Manually verify that your classpath does not contain duplicate JARs.
+
[NOTE]
====
The downloaded ZIP's `binaries` directory contains far more JARs then `optaplanner-core` actually uses.
It also contains the JARs used by other modules, such as `optaplanner-benchmark`.

Check the Maven repository `pom.xml` files to determine the minimal dependency set for a specific version of a specific module.
