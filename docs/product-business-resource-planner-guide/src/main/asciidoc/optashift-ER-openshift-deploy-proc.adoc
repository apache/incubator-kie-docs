= Installing and running the employee rostering demonstration on OpenShift

You can deploy the {PLANNER} Employee Rostering starter application to an OpenShift instance.

.Preparing deployment files
. Unzip the add-ons distribution (`rhdm-{PRODUCT_VERSION}.0-add-ons.zip`).
. Unzip the employee-rostering zip file that is extracted from the add-ons archive.
+
[NOTE]
====
When you unzip the employee-rostering zip file, the `optashift-employee-rostering-{MAVEN_ARTIFACT_VERSION}` folder is created. This folder is the base folder in subsequent steps.  File and folder names may have higher version numbers than specifically noted in this document.
====

There are two options for quickly deploying this application to OpenShift:

1. Using the Source to Image (S2I) template. This template pulls the source for the application from a Git repository and builds it during the deployment.

2. Using the pre-built binary application archive that is provided in the distribution. In this case, a template prepares the environment but does not rebuild the application.

[NOTE]
====
The S2I approach requires significantly more resources to complete than the binary deployment. If your OpenShift environment has less than 2GB of memory available, for example, when using the OpenShift Online Starter tier, you must follow the binary deployment approach.
====

== Deploying using the Source to Image (S2I) template
.Procedure
. Log in to the OpenShift web console and click Import YAML/JSON in the upper right corner.
. Select the project to add to from the Add to Project drop down menu, or select Create Project to create a new one. If creating a new project, enter a new project name, display name, and description.
. Click the *Browse* button and navigate to the `optashift-employee-rostering-template.yaml` file. Starting from the `optashift-employee-rostering-{MAVEN_ARTIFACT_VERSION}` folder, access the file by clicking *sources > openshift > templates*.
. Click *Create*.
+
.Upload template window

+
. In the Add Template dialog box, click *Continue* to accept the default settings.

.Add template window

. In the Import YAML/JSON dialog box, click *Create* to accept the default settings.
+
.Configure template window

+
. In the Success dialog box, click *Close*.
. Wait for the build and deployment to complete. This might take several minutes. When the deployment completes, click the link in the upper right corner and above the shaded bar to open the application.
+
.Completed deployment and resulting link

Perform a hard refresh of your browser page if the web app does not open after clicking the link.

== Deploying with pre-built binary

.Procedure
. Prepare the binary deployment.
+
[NOTE]
====
You must conduct binary deployments using the oc command line tools.  See the OpenShift documentation for installation steps.
====
+
.. Working from the `optashift-employee-rostering-{MAVEN_ARTIFACT_VERSION}` distribution folder, open the `binaries` folder.
.. Copy the `optashift-employee-rostering-webapp-{MAVEN_ARTIFACT_VERSION}.war` to the `sources` folder.
.. Rename the file to `ROOT.war`. The updated name instructs the application server to deploy the file to the root context of the server.
+
. Using the command line, change to the `sources` folder.
+
. Create a project using the following command:
+
[source]
----
oc new-project optashift-demo --display-name="Employee Rostering Demo"
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Alternatively, you can use an existing project. In this case, replace all instances of `optashift-demo` in this procedure with your project name.
====
+
. Create a build and deployment configuration. Use the `optashift-employee-rostering-template-binary.yaml` template file to set the OpenShift configuration, such as the route to expose the application to make it accessible to browsers.
+
[source]
----
oc process -f openshift/templates/optashift-employee-rostering-template-binary.yaml -n optashift-demo | oc create -f - -n optashift-demo
----
+
+
. Upload the binary file to begin a deployment.
+
[source]
----
oc start-build employee-rostering --from-file=ROOT.war
----
+
. Use the OpenShift web UI to view the details for the deployed application. Click the link in the Routes section to open the starter application.
+

//.Procedure
//. Build from local source
// ./provision.sh setup employee-rostering --binary
// This doesn't work in current release
// TODO: revisit deploying from local build once issue is resolved: https://issues.jboss.org/browse/BXMSPROD-1
