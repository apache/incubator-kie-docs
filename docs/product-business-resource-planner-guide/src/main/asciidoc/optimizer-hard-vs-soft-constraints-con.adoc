= A planning problem has (hard and soft) constraints

Usually, a planning problem has at least two levels of constraints:

* A _(negative) hard constraint_ must not be broken. 
+
For example, one teacher can not teach two different lessons at the same time.
* A _(negative) soft constraint_ should not be broken if it can be avoided. 
+
For example, Teacher A does not like to teach on Friday afternoon.

Some problems also have positive constraints:

* A _positive soft constraint (or reward)_ should be fulfilled if possible. 
+
For example, Teacher B likes to teach on Monday morning.

Some basic problems only have hard constraints.
Some problems have three or more levels of constraints, for example, hard, medium, and soft constraints.

These constraints define the _score calculation_ (otherwise known as the __fitness function__) of a planning problem.
Each solution of a planning problem can be graded with a score. With the Business Optimizer, score constraints are written in an Object Oriented language, such as Java code or Drools rules.

Such code is flexible and scalable.
