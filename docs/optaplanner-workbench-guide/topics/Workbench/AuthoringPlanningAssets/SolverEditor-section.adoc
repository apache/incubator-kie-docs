= Solver Editor

The solver editor creates a solver configuration that can be run in the Execution Solver or plain Java code after the kjar is deployed.

[NOTE]
====
To see and use this editor, the user needs to have the role ``plannermgmt``.
====

Use the `Validate` button to validate the solver configuration.
This will actually build a Solver, so most issues in your project will present itself then, without the need to deploy and run it.

By default, the solver configuration will automatically scan for all planning entities and a planning solution classes.
If none are found (or too many), validation will fail.
