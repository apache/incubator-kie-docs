= Comparison: {xpaasproduct-shortname} and {KIE_SERVER}
This topic details the differences between {xpaasproduct-shortname} and the
full, non-PaaS release of {PRODUCT}, and provides instructions specific to running and
configuring {xpaasproduct-shortname}. +
Documentation for other {KIE_SERVER} functionality not specific to {xpaasproduct-shortname} can be found in the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-jboss-bpm-suite/[{PRODUCT} documentation] on the Red Hat Customer Portal.


== Functionality Differences for {xpaasproduct-shortname} images

There are several major functionality differences between the regular release of {PRODUCT} {KIE_SERVER} and the {xpaasproduct-shortname}:

* {xpaasproduct-shortname} extends the OpenShift EAP image, and any capabilities or limitations it has are also found in the {xpaasproduct-shortname}.
* Business Central is not included in {xpaasproduct-shortname}. To connect to the {KIE_SERVER} web console, click the *Open Java Console* button in OpenShift 3.2.
* Authoring of any content through the {PRODUCT} Console or API is not supported.
* There is no support for the `Singleton` strategy for maintaining a single instance of the `RuntimeEngine`.

== Managing {xpaasproduct-shortname}

As {xpaasproduct-shortname} is built off EAP for OpenShift, the JBoss EAP Management CLI
is accessible from within the container for troubleshooting purposes.

. First open a remote shell session to the running pod:
+
----
$ oc rsh <pod_name>
----
+
. Then run the following from the remote shell session to launch the JBoss EAP
Management CLI:
+
----
$ /opt/eap/bin/jboss-cli.sh
----

[WARNING]
Any configuration changes made using the JBoss EAP Management CLI on a running container will be lost when the container restarts.

[[Security-Openshift-IPS-xPaaS-Image]]
= Security in {xpaasproduct-shortname}

Access is limited to users with the *_kie-server_* authorization role.  A user with this role
can be specified via the *_KIE_SERVER_USER_* and *_KIE_SERVER_PASSWORD_* environment variables.

[NOTE]
The HTTP/REST endpoint is configured to only allow the execution of KIE containers and querying
of KIE Server resources.  Administrative functions like creating or disposing Containers, updating
ReleaseIds or Scanners, etc. are restricted.  The JMS endpoint currently does not support these
restrictions.  In the future, more fine-grained security configuration should be available for
both endpoints.

= Using {xpaasproduct-shortname} Image Streams and Application Templates
The Red Hat xPaaS middleware images were
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/openshift-enterprise/version-3.2/installation-and-configuration#loading-the-default-image-streams-and-templates[automatically created during the installation]
of OpenShift along with the other default image streams and templates.

= Version Compatibility and Support
See the xPaaS part of the https://access.redhat.com/articles/2176281[OpenShift and Atomic Platform Tested Integrations page] for details about OpenShift image version compatibility.

= Initial Setup
The Tutorials in this guide follow on from and assume an OpenShift instance similar to that created in the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-xpaas/0/openshift-primer/openshift-primer[OpenShift Primer].
