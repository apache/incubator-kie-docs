= Example Workflow: Deploying a {PRODUCT} Project as {xpaasproduct-shortname} image

Business Central, the {PRODUCT} console that provides a unified web-based environment for managing projects, is not part of {xpaasproduct-shortname}. An external repository is required to integrate projects between Business Central and OpenShift. This tutorial presumes that a project has already been set up in Business Central.

== Preparing the {PRODUCT} Project

Prepare a Git repository for the project configuration files. The repository is used to store the Maven repository and KIE container deployment files. The Git repository has the following file hierarchy: 

- *../configuration/settings.xml* for the Maven repository
- *../.s2i/environment* for the KIE container deployment

Preparation of the {PRODUCT} project may require some prior knowledge with the {PRODUCT}. Refer to the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_JBoss_BPM_Suite/6.3/html/User_Guide/[{PRODUCT} User Guide] for more information on any of these tasks.

. Log in to {PRODUCT}: Business Central web console.
. Clone the existing repository to ensure it is up-to-date.
.. `Authoring` -> `Administration`
.. `Repositories` -> `Clone Repository`
.. Provide the *Repository Name*, *Organizational Unit*, and the *Git URL* and click the `Clone` button.


. Using *Repository View*, ensure the *pom.xml* is configured to use a remote repository by containing xml similar to the following: 
+
----
...
<distributionManagement>
  <repository>
    <id>deployment</id>
    <name>OpenShift Maven repo</name>
    <url>http://maven.example/content/repo/deployments/</url>
  </repository>
  <snapshotRepository>
    <id>deployment</id> 
    <name>OpenShift Maven repo</name>
    <url>http://maven.example/content/repo/snapshots/</url>
  </snapshotRepository>
</distributionManagement>
...
----
+
For more information, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_JBoss_BRMS/6.3/html-single/Administration_And_Configuration_Guide/#Configuring_deployment_to_a_remote_Nexus_repository[the Red Hat JBoss BRMS Administration and Configuration Guide].
. In the application repository, ensure the *configuration/settings.xml* and the *.s2i/environment* files define the Maven repository and the KIE container deployment respectively:
.. The Maven repository should be defined in the *configuration/settings.xml* so that OpenShift can download the application artifacts. It should contain xml similar to the following: 
+
----
...
<profiles>
  <profile>
    <id>openshift-mirror-repositories</id>
    <repositories>
      <repository>
        <id>openshift-mirror</id>
        <url>http://maven.example/content/group/public/</url>
      </repository>
    </repositories>

    <pluginRepositories>
      <pluginRepository>
        <id>openshift-mirror</id>
        <url>http://maven.example/content/group/public/</url>
      </pluginRepository>
    </pluginRepositories>
  </profile>
</profiles>
...
----

For more information, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_JBoss_BRMS/6.3/html/Installation_Guide/Using_the_JBoss_Integration_Maven_Repository_Local_Access.html[the Red Hat JBoss BRMS Installation Guide]. 
.. The *.s2i/environment* file must define the KIE container deployment, including which KIE jars to use and the location from which to retrieve them. The pod name is derived from the deployment alias, which is defined as _ipsDemo_ in this example:
+
----
KIE_CONTAINER_DEPLOYMENT=ipsDemo=com.example.openshift:example_workflow:1.0
----
. Click *Save* if any changes have been made to the project.
. Click *Open Project Editor* -> *Build* -> *Build and Deploy*. This will push the project artifacts into the Maven repository so that it is ready to be deployed on OpenShift.

== Preparing Intelligent Process Server Deployment
. Create a new project: 
+
----
$ oc new-project ips-app-demo
----
. Create a service account to be used for the {KIE_SERVER} deployment: 
+
----
$ oc create serviceaccount ips-service-account
----
. Add the view role to the service account. This enables the service account to view all the resources in the ips-app-demo namespace, which is necessary for managing the cluster. 
+
----
$ oc policy add-role-to-user view system:serviceaccount:ips-app-demo:ips-service-account
----
. The Intelligent Process Server template requires an SSL keystore and a JGroups keystore. +
These keystores are expected even if the application will not use https. +
This example uses ‘keytool’, a package included with the Java Development Kit, to generate self-signed certificates for these keystores. The following commands will prompt for passwords. +
.. Generate a secure key for the SSL keystore: 
+
----
$ keytool -genkeypair -alias https -storetype JKS -keystore keystore.jks
----
.. Generate a secure key for the JGroups keystore: 
+
----
$ keytool -genseckey -alias jgroups -storetype JCEKS -keystore jgroups.jceks
----
. Use the SSL and JGroup keystore files to create the secret for the project: 
+
----
$ oc create secret generic ips-app-secret --from-file=jgroups.jceks --from-file=keystore.jks
----
. Add the secret to the service account created earlier: 
+
----
$ oc secret add sa/ips-service-account secret/ips-app-secret
----

== Deployment
. Log in to the OpenShift web console and select the _ips-app-demo_ project space.     
. Click *Add to Project* to list all of the default image streams and templates.         
. Use the *Filter by keyword* search bar to limit the list to those that match `processserver`. You may need to click *See all* to show the desired application template. 
. Select and configure the desired template. +
The *SOURCE_REPOSITORY_URL* must be set to the Git repository for the deployment, so that the application can pull the *configuration/settings.xml* and *.s2i/environment* files.
. Click *Deploy*.

During the build, the Maven repository is downloaded and build into the container so that no additional packages or dependencies are downloaded at runtime. 

The application is available once the pod is running. 


[[Tutorial-Adding_Updated_Version]]
= Example Workflow: Deploying an Updated Version Concurrently with Original Application

This example workflow follows on from link:#Tutorial-Deploying-IPS[Example Workflow: Deploying a {PRODUCT} Project as an xPaaS Intelligent Process Server xPaaS Image], in which the _1.0_ version of the _example_workflow_ artifact was deployed with a deployment alias of _ipsDemo_. This example deploys a _1.1_ version of the of the _example_workflow_ artifact alongside the _1.0_ version so that both versions of the _example_workflow_ artifact are running simultaneously, both with the _ipsDemo_ deployment alias. 

. Update the repository with the new version of the server. 
. Edit the *.s2i/environment* file for the application:
.. Change the *KIE_CONTAINER_DEPLOYMENT* variable to *KIE_CONTAINER_DEPLOYMENT_OVERRIDE*
.. Add the new version to the end of the value string, separated from the older version with a pipe.
+
----
KIE_CONTAINER_DEPLOYMENT_OVERRIDE=ipsDemo=com.example.openshift:example_workflow:1.0|ipsDemo=com.example.openshift:example_workflow:1.1
----
. Save the changes.
. If the project has link:https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.1/dev_guide/builds.html#webhook-triggers[GitHub Webhooks] configured, the new version will be deployed automatically alongside the older running applicaiton. Otherwise it can be manually built:
+
----
$ oc start-build ips-app-demo
----

Once the build has completed, the two different versions of the application will be running simultaneously using the same deployment alias. See link:#Request-Targeting[Request Targeting for Multiple Versions] for more information on how client requests are redirected to the correct version of the application.
