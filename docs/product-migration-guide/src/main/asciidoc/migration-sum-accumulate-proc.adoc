= Review sum functions 

In Red Hat BRMS 6.4, when a rule executes the sum function in an accumulate pattern, the result always returns as a double data type regardless of the data type of the inputs. {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} preserves the data type of the inputs on which the sum is executed. This enhancement provides a more accurate result from the sum function. In the following example, the result type of the accumulate function is long instead of double:

[source]
----
Long(...) from accumulate(..., sum($p.getLongWeight()))
----

If the rules in your Red Hat BRMS 6.4 project include the sum function in an accumulate pattern, search for these functions and review them. Keep in mind that these functions return a double data type in Red Hat BRMS 6.4, but will return the data type of the input values in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}.
