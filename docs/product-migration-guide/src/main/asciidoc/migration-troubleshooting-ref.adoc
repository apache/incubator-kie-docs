= Troubleshooting {CENTRAL} migration problems

If you encounter problems with your {CENTRAL} migration to {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}, review the following troubleshooting suggestions:

* If any project data is missing from {CENTRAL}, ensure that the `.niogit` directory for {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} contains the restructured data and is in the correct installation location for {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} (for example, `~/$EAP_HOME/bin/`).
* If projects fail to build in {CENTRAL}, open the project `pom.xml` file and remove the `guvnor-m2-repo` repository, if present. This repository is added to the  `pom.xml` file during the *POMs migration* process of the {CENTRAL} migration tool and in some cases prevents projects from building properly.

Example repository to be removed from `pom.xml` file:

[source]
----
<repository>
  <id>guvnor-m2-repo</id>
  <name>Guvnor M2 Repo</name>
  <url>http://localhost:8080/business-central/maven2/</url>
</repository>
----
--
* If projects fail to deploy to {KIE_SERVER}, review your {KIE_SERVER} installation and configuration. For more information, see Planning the {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} installation.
//@link: Update install link above.
* If you encounter other migration problems, review xref:migration-other-changes-con[].
* If you cannot resolve migration problems, complete the migration process again on a new {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} installation.
