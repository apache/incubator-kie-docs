= Migrating {CENTRAL} used as design environment and as execution server

In {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}, {CENTRAL} no longer has execution server capabilities nor any remote Java API endpoints. Instead, the {KIE_SERVER} performs all execution and runtime functions and {CENTRAL} is used only for designing and managing decision services. Therefore, if you use {CENTRAL} as both a designing environment and as an execution server with live tasks and process instances, follow the migration steps in this section.

If you use {CENTRAL} as a designing environment only, with no execution server functionality, follow the migration steps in xref:migration-non-execution-server-con[]. A separate migration path is required to transfer execution server functionality to the {KIE_SERVER} for {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}, in addition to {CENTRAL} data.

.Prerequisites
* {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} is installed on a separate instance from {PRODUCT_OLD} (on {EAP} or other option). For installation options, see Planning the {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} installation.
//@link: Add link to insall planning doc.
* All {CENTRAL} data for {PRODUCT_OLD} 6.4, including a database used with it (if applicable), has been fully backed up. This is a precaution in case of problems during migration.
