= Functionality of migrated assets in {CENTRAL}

Several asset designers have been improved in {CENTRAL} for {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}. As a result of this ongoing effort to improve {CENTRAL}, some previously supported asset features and functions have changed or cannot currently be migrated. Before migrating your project data, consider the following assets with different feature support in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}.

Forms::
Forms are migrated to {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} by a forms migration tool that is part of the xref:migration-tool-7.0-proc[{CENTRAL} migration tool]. However, certain limitations and other considerations apply to forms migration:

* Existing forms in {PRODUCT_OLD} must be correct. If a conflict arises during migration, some forms might not be migrated.
* Forms related to business processes (forms that end with `\"taskform\"` suffix) no longer support fields with nested bindings (such as client/name) caused by data object variables on the process. Any forms with nested bindings will result in additional SubForms during migration.
* Forms that are not related to business processes (forms that do not end with a `\"taskform\"` suffix) must have only one `DataHolder` of type `Data Object` or `ClassName`.
* The new forms designer does not support different bindings for input and output of processes. The same binding must be assigned to the input and output of processes.

Business processes::
Business processes migrated to {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} by the xref:migration-tool-7.0-proc[{CENTRAL} migration tool] are stored as `.bpmn2` files. These files are managed in an improved process designer with some changes in process functionality. If any critical features for your processes are no longer supported in the new process designer, you can roll back the process file to the previous `.bpmn` format until support is restored in future releases. For more information about creating and managing processes in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}, see Getting started with business processes.

Pages (previously Dashboards)::
Dashboards in {PRODUCT_OLD} 6.4 cannot be migrated to {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}. Any existing dashboards must be re-created as Pages in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}. For information about creating and managing Pages, see Building custom pages.
