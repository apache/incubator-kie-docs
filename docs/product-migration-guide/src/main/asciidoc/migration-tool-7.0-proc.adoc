= Use the {CENTRAL} migration tool

{PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} contains a modified data structure and other feature changes that do not support a direct data migration from {PRODUCT_OLD} 6.4. Therefore, Red Hat provides a migration tool that enables you to migrate project data and system configurations from {PRODUCT_OLD} 6.4 to {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}. This migration tool operates on the `.niogit` directory of your {CENTRAL} distribution to prepare your {CENTRAL} data for the new data structure and features supported in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}.

The migration tool includes the following individual migration tools:

* *Project migration tool*: Migrates the {PRODUCT_OLD} 6.4 project repository structure to the new project-oriented structure used in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}.
* *System configuration migration tool*: Migrates the `system.git` repository structure used in {PRODUCT_OLD} 6.4 to the new structure used in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}. This tool requires the project migration tool to be executed first.
ifdef::PAM[]
* *Forms migration tool*: Migrates forms created in the {PRODUCT_OLD} 6.4 forms designer to the new forms designer. This tool requires the project migration tool and system configuration migration tool to be executed first.
endif::PAM[]

.Using the migration tool with external Git repositories
[NOTE]
====
If you want to migrate example projects in a Git repository outside of your `.niogit` directory, you can clone the repository locally and then run the migration tool using the repository path instead of the `.niogit` directory path. You do not need to create a second local copy of the Git repository as you do with the `.niogit` directory, because the local clone on which the migration tool operates is separate from the original repository. Only files in project directories in the Git repository will be migrated. The system configuration migration tool does not apply when you migrate external Git repositories. After the migration tool runs, you can then import the newly structured project repositories into {CENTRAL} for {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}.
====

.Prerequisites
* {CENTRAL} is not running for either {PRODUCT_OLD} 6.4 or {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}.
* Java 8 is installed and is available on the path where the project migration tool will be installed.

.Procedure
. Locate the `bin/.niogit` directory in your current {CENTRAL} distribution for {PRODUCT_OLD} 6.4 and locate the same directory in your new {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} installation.
+
--
Example:
[source]
----
$ ~/$JBOSS_HOME/bin/.niogit
----

ifdef::PAM[]
[source]
----
$ ~/$RHPAM_HOME/bin/.niogit
----
endif::PAM[]
ifdef::DM[]
[source]
----
$ ~/$RHDM_HOME/bin/.niogit
----
endif::DM[]
--
. In your command terminal, copy the `.niogit` directory from your current {CENTRAL} distribution for {PRODUCT_OLD} 6.4 to the `bin` folder of the new {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} installation directory:
+
--
ifdef::PAM[]
[source]
----
cp -r /$JBOSS_HOME/bin/.niogit  /$RHPAM_HOME/bin/
----
endif::PAM[]
ifdef::DM[]
[source]
----
cp -r /$JBOSS_HOME/bin/.niogit  /$RHDM_HOME/bin/
----
endif::DM[]

The copied `.niogit` folder is the directory that the migration tool will prepare for {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}. The original `.niogit` folder remains in your {PRODUCT_OLD} 6.4 installation and will not be modified by the migration tool in this procedure.
--
. In the {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} `bin` directory, delete the `.index` directory. You must delete this folder because {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} comes with certain updates that are not compatible with {PRODUCT_OLD} 6.4. The `bin` directory will be re-indexed after the migration when you start {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}.
. Note the path to the copied `.niogit` directory for {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}. The path will be required when you run the migration tool.
. Navigate to the https://access.redhat.com/jbossnetwork/restricted/listSoftware.html[Software Downloads] page in the Red Hat Customer Portal (login required), and select the product and version from the drop-down options:
* *Product:* {PRODUCT_SHORT}
* *Version:* {PRODUCT_VERSION}
. Download *{PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION_LONG} Add-Ons* and extract the downloaded `{PRODUCT_FILE}-add-ons.zip` folder to a temporary directory.
. In the extracted `{PRODUCT_FILE}-add-ons` folder, extract the `{PRODUCT_INIT}-{PRODUCT_VERSION}-migration-tool.zip` sub-folder. The migration tool is in the `bin` directory.
+
. In your command terminal, navigate to the temporary directory where you extracted the `{PRODUCT_INIT}-{PRODUCT_VERSION}-migration-tool` folder and run the migration tool. The `${PRODUCT_INIT_CAP}_NIOGIT_DIR` portion is the path to the `.niogit` directory that you previously copied to the {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} installation.

On Linux or UNIX-based systems:
[source]
ifdef::PAM[]
----
$ cd $INSTALL_DIR/rhpam-7.0-migration-tool/bin
$ ./migration-tool.sh -t $RHPAM_NIOGIT_DIR
----
endif::PAM[]
ifdef::DM[]
----
$ cd $INSTALL_DIR/rhdm-7.0-migration-tool/bin
$ ./migration-tool.sh -t $RHDM_NIOGIT_DIR
----
endif::DM[]

On Windows:
[source]
ifdef::PAM[]
----
$ cd $INSTALL_DIR\rhpam-7.0-migration-tool\bin
$ migration-tool.bat -t $RHPAM_NIOGIT_DIR
----
endif::PAM[]
ifdef::DM[]
----
$ cd $INSTALL_DIR\rhdm-7.0-migration-tool\bin
$ migration-tool.bat -t $RHDM_NIOGIT_DIR
----
endif::DM[]
--
+
NOTE: If you are migrating example projects in a Git repository outside of your `.niogit` directory, replace the `.niogit` directory path
ifdef::PAM[]
(`$RHPAM_NIOGIT_DIR`)
endif::PAM[]
ifdef::DM[]
(`$RHDM_NIOGIT_DIR`)
endif::DM[]
with the external Git repository path.
+

. In the command prompt that appears, select the option to run *ALL* migration tools in sequence.
+
NOTE: If you prefer to run one migration tool at a time, select and run the first individual migration tool. After the tool runs, re-run the {CENTRAL} migration tool and select the next individual tool in the sequence.
+

After the tool finishes running, the `.niogit` directory structure is compatible with {CENTRAL} in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}.

// Old way to install tool, before zip distro. Retaining temporarily. (Stetson, 27 Mar 2018)
. In your terminal application, clone the `kie-wb-common` https://github.com/kiegroup/kie-wb-common[GitHub project] to a local directory:
+
[source]
----
$ ~/$REPO_DIR/git clone https://github.com/kiegroup/kie-wb-common.git
----
. In the cloned `kie-wb-common` directory, navigate to `kie-wb-common/kie-wb-common-cli/kie-wb-common-cli/kie-wb-common-cli-migration-tool` and run the following command:
+
[source]
----
mvn clean install
----
+
. After the installation completes, navigate to the newly created `target` directory within the tool folder and unzip the `kie-wb-common-cli-migration-tool-$VERSION-dist.zip` folder to a desired installation directory.



// Importing projects,not needed but retaining temporarily.
. In {CENTRAL}, navigate to *Menu* -> *Design* -> *Projects* and select or create the space into which you want to import the projects. The default space is *myteam*.
. Click the three vertical dots in the upper-right corner of the screen and select *Import Project*.
. For the *Repository URL*, enter the path to one of the repositories in your `.niogit` directory in the following format:
+
--
[source]
----
file:///$NIOGIT_DIR/$REPOSITORY.git
----
For example, if the location of the `.niogit` directory is `/opt/eap7.0/bin/.niogit` and you want to import a project from the `repository1` repository, you would enter the following path:

[source]
----
file://opt/eap7.0/bin/.niogit/repository1.git
----
--
. Click *Import*, select the project to import, and click *Import*.
. After the importing and indexing is complete, repeat these importing steps for each repository that you want to add to {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}.

.`NoRemoteRepositoryException`
[NOTE]
====
If during the import a `NoRemoteRepositoryException` error appears, you can temporarily remove the repository remotes in your terminal.

For example:

[subs="verbatim,macros"]
----
$ ~/opt/eap7.0/bin/.niogit/repository1.git
$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/guvnorngtestuser1/guvnorng-playground (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/guvnorngtestuser1/guvnorng-playground (push)
$ git remote remove origin
----

Then import the projects again. You can add the remotes in the new repository later if necessary (`git remote add $REPOSITORY_URL`).
