= Migrating {CENTRAL} data

{PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} contains two major changes that affect project migration:

* New project data structure with only one project per repository in each Space
* No execution server capabilities in {CENTRAL}, only in {KIE_SERVER}

Red Hat provides a project migration tool that you can use to migrate project data from {PRODUCT_OLD} 6.4 to the new data structure in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}. You can also manually restructure and migrate project data to the new {CENTRAL} if you encounter errors with the migration tool.

However, if you use {CENTRAL} as a live instance containing an execution server, you must perform additional migration steps to ensure that the execution server functionality is also migrated to the {KIE_SERVER} for {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}.
