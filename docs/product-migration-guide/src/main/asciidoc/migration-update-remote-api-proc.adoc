= Replace API references to {CENTRAL} execution server

In {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}, {CENTRAL} no longer has execution server capabilities nor any API endpoints related to the execution server. Instead, the {KIE_SERVER} performs all execution and runtime functions and {CENTRAL} is used only for designing and managing decision services. Therefore, if any of your applications interact with the {CENTRAL} execution server through the remote Java API (`kie-remote-client`) or through direct REST API calls (`/business-central/rest/`), you must update these API references to redirect to {KIE_SERVER}.

.Procedure
. In your application code for remote Java clients, replace any instances of the following legacy package and module for {CENTRAL} with the new package and module for {KIE_SERVER}. This replaces references to the remote Java API with references to {KIE_SERVER}.
+
--
Legacy {CENTRAL} package and module:
[source,java]
----
org.kie.remote.client
kie-remote-client
----

New {KIE_SERVER} package and module:
[source,java]
----
org.kie.server.client
kie-server-client
----
--
. Wherever applicable in your application code, replace any legacy REST API calls in the format `http://<SERVER>:<PORT>/business-central/rest/<REQUEST_BODY>` with new REST API calls in the format `http://<SERVER>:<PORT>/kie-server/services/rest/server<REQUEST_BODY>`. This replaces references to the {CENTRAL} execution server with references to {KIE_SERVER}.

*<@Maciej: Is what I say above correct? It will remove all refs to all {CENTRAL} REST APIs (including Knowledge Store) and remote Java APIs, if I understand correctly. I don't know if that's what we want, but I don't know what to tell users otherwise. For example, the {KIE_SEVER} controller is `http://<SERVER>:<PORT>/business-central/rest/controller` when it's {CENTRAL}. This is what we tell them in xref:migration-configure-kie-server-proc[]. So if users do the above replacement, will that be a problem for the {CENTRAL} controller? Am I wrong in something, or do we just need to put an emphatic note that they should replace all `business-central/rest/` instances EXCEPT for `business-central/rest/controller`, or replace more specific APIs?>*

The following example is an update to a REST API call for tasks.

Legacy {CENTRAL} REST API call:
[source]
----
http://localhost:8080/business-central/rest/tasks
----

New {KIE_SERVER} API call:
[source]
----
http://localhost:8080/kie-server/services/rest/server/tasks
----

NOTE: If {KIE_SERVER} is deployed in a separate {EAP} or other environment or has been moved to a new location, the server and port locations will differ from {CENTRAL}.
