= Upgrade  6.x User Applications

You must upgrade applications created in BRMS 6.4 before you run them in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}.  When you compile a 6.4 application using Decision Manager {PRODUCT_VERSION} artifacts, the compilation will fail. Review the error report generated by the compilation to identify areas to fix.
