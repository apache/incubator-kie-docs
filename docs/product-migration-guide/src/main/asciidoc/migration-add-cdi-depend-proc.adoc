= Adding the CDI dependency

The Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI) extension that provides the capability to inject a KIE object into your project has been moved from the drools-compiler to a standalone module. Therefore, you must add a dependency on org.drools:drools-cdi to your Red Hat BRMS 6.4 projects. If you do not add this dependency, the extension will not be recognized by the CDI implementation and the injection will not work.
