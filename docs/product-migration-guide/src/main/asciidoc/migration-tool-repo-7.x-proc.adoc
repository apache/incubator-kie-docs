= Using the migration tool on an external Git repository

If you store {CENTRAL} project data in a Git repository outside of your `.niogit` directory, you can also use the {CENTRAL} migration tool on the external repository to prepare project data for {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}. Only files in project directories in the Git repository will be restructured by the migration tool.

.Prerequisite
Java 8 is installed and is available on the path where the project migration tool will be installed.

.Procedure
. In a local directory, create a clone of the Git repository containing the projects to be migrated (if the repository has not been cloned already).
+
[source]
----
$ cd $REPO_DIR/
$ git clone $GIT_REPO_URL
----
. Note the path to the cloned Git repository. The path will be required when you run the migration tool.
. Create an output directory where a copy of the newly migrated repository or repositories will be placed after the migration tool runs. You can also use an existing directory as an output location. Note the path to this output directory. The migration tool operates on a copy of the cloned repository and will prompt you for the new output directory path when you run the tool.
. If you have specific `dependencies`, `repositories`, or `pluginRepositories` that you want to add, remove, or update as part of the project migration, create a `pom-migration.json` file containing these elements. When you run the migration tool, the tool will prompt you if you want to include this file in the migration.
+
--
The `pom-migration.json` file requires the following sections:

* `"dependencies":[]`
* `"repositories-add":[]`
* `"repositories-remove":[]`
* `"repositories-update-urls":[]`
* `"pluginRepositories-add":[]`
* `"pluginRepositories-remove":[]`
* `"pluginRepositories-update-urls":[]`


If any of these elements do not apply to your project, include them as empty sections to prevent parsing errors.

. Navigate to the https://access.redhat.com/jbossnetwork/restricted/listSoftware.html[Software Downloads] page in the Red Hat Customer Portal (login required), and select the product and version from the drop-down options:
* *Product:* {PRODUCT_SHORT}
* *Version:* {PRODUCT_VERSION}
. Download *{PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION_LONG} Add-Ons* and extract the downloaded `{PRODUCT_FILE}-add-ons.zip` file to a temporary directory.
. In the extracted `{PRODUCT_FILE}-add-ons` folder, extract the `{PRODUCT_INIT}-{PRODUCT_VERSION}-migration-tool.zip` sub-folder. The migration tool is in the `bin` directory.
. In your command terminal, navigate to the temporary directory where you extracted the `{PRODUCT_INIT}-{PRODUCT_VERSION}-migration-tool` folder and run the migration tool. The `$GIT_REPO_PATH` portion is the path to the cloned Git repository.

$ cd $INSTALL_DIR/{PRODUCT_INIT}-{PRODUCT_VERSION}-migration-tool/bin

. In the command prompt that appears, enter the path to the output directory where the migrated copy of the repository will be placed. The migration tool operates on a copy of the cloned repository and will place the new repository or repositories in the output location that you specify.
+
--
After you enter the output location, the migration tool prepares the repository copy and restructures all project directories to be compatible with {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}.

In the command prompt, the following additional migration options are displayed:

ifdef::PAM[]
* *Forms migration*: Migrates forms created in the {PRODUCT_OLD} forms designer to the new forms designer.
endif::PAM[]
* *POMs migration:* Updates `pom.xml` files with dependencies required for {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}.
ifdef::PAM[]
This migration option requires the forms migration to be executed first.
endif::PAM[]
* *All:* Runs all remaining migration options in sequence.
* *Exit:* Exits the migration tool.

NOTE: The *Project structure migration* option is not displayed because that option was run automatically when you entered the output location to initiate the migration tool.
--

. Select the option to run *ALL* migrations in sequence.
+
NOTE: If you prefer to run one migration option at a time, select and run the first individual migration option. After the tool runs, re-run the {CENTRAL} migration tool and select the next individual migration option in the sequence.
+

. Enter `yes` each time you are prompted to run a specific migration option.
+
For the POMs migration option, if you want to include a path to an external `pom-migration.json` file that you created previously, enter `yes` when prompted and enter the path.
+
. After the tool finishes running, enter the option to *Exit* the migration tool.
+
The project directories in the specified output location are now separated into individual repositories compatible with {CENTRAL} in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}. The new project repositories are bare repositories with no working directory, and therefore do not show any content files. You can clone each repository to create non-bare repositories and inspect directory contents.
+
. Log in to {CENTRAL} for {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}.
. For each project, create or select the space for the project and click *Import Project*.
. Enter the *Repository URL* for the newly structured project repository. This URL may be the local file path to the output location if you are importing directly from the workstation where you ran the migration tool, or a GitHub URL or other file hosting location where you have uploaded the repository.

NOTE: If you use Git `hooks` with your project data, you may need to update your `hooks` scripts to accommodate the migration.
