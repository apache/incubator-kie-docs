= Configure and start {KIE_SERVER}

After you have migrated all {CENTRAL} data and have upgraded the relevant database, configure and start the new {KIE_SERVER} to transfer the execution server functionality and apply the migrated changes.

.Prerequisites
* Project data from {PRODUCT_OLD} 6.4 has been migrated using the {CENTRAL} migration tool.
* The {PRODUCT_OLD} 6.4 database to be used with {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} has been upgraded.
* All API references to {CENTRAL} execution server in application code have been redirected to the {KIE_SERVER}.

.Procedure
Navigate to the {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} `bin` directory and start the new {KIE_SERVER} with the following properties. Adjust the specific properties according to your environment.

[source,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ ~/EAP_HOME/bin/standalone.sh --server-config=standalone-full.xml <1>
-Dorg.kie.server.id=myserver <2>
-Dorg.kie.server.controller=http://localhost:8080/{URL_COMPONENT_CENTRAL}/rest/controller <3>
-Dorg.kie.server.location=http://localhost:8080/kie-server/services/rest/server <4>
-Dorg.kie.server.persistence.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect <5>
-Dorg.kie.server.persistence.ds=java:jboss/datasources/psjbpmDS <6>
----
<1> Start command with `standalone-full.xml` server profile
<2> Server ID that must match the server configuration name defined in {CENTRAL}
<3> Controller location, {CENTRAL} URL with `/rest/controller` suffix
<4> {KIE_SERVER} location (on the same instance as {CENTRAL} in this example)
<5> Hibernate dialect to be used
<6> JNDI name of the data source used for your previous {PRODUCT_OLD} database

[NOTE]
====
If {CENTRAL} and {KIE_SERVER} are installed on separate application server instances ({EAP} or other), use a separate port for the {KIE_SERVER} location to avoid port conflicts with {CENTRAL}. If a separate {KIE_SERVER} port has not already been configured, you can add a port offset and adjust the {KIE_SERVER} port value accordingly in the {KIE_SERVER} properties.

Example:

[source]
----
-Djboss.socket.binding.port-offset=150
-Dorg.kie.server.location=http://localhost:8230/kie-server/services/rest/server
----

If the {CENTRAL} port is 8080, as in this example, then the {KIE_SERVER} port, with a defined offset of 150, is 8230.
====

{KIE_SERVER} connects to the new {CENTRAL} and collects the list of deployment units (KIE containers) to be deployed.
