== JMX support for KieScanner


Added support for JMX monitoring and management on KieScanner and KieContainer.
To enable, set the property `kie.scanner.mbeans` to ``enabled``, for example via Java command line: `` -Dkie.scanner.mbeans=enabled ``.

KieScannerMBean will register under the name:

It exposes the following properties:



* *Scanner Release Id:* the release ID the scanner was configured with. May include maven range versions and special keywords like LATEST, SNAPSHOT, etc.
* **Current Release Id: **the actual release ID the artifact resolved to.
* *Status:* STARTING, SCANNING, UPDATING, RUNNING, STOPPED, SHUTDOWN

It also exposes the following operations:



* *scanNow():* forces an immediate scan of the maven repository looking for artifact updates
* *start():* starts polling the maven repository for artifact updates based on the polling interval parameter
* *stop():* stops automatically polling the maven repository
