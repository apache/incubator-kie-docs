= Memory Management for Events

[IMPORTANT]
====
The automatic memory management for events is only performed when running the engine in STREAM mode.
Check the Event Processing Mode section for details on how the STREAM mode works.
====


One of the benefits of running the engine in STREAM mode is that the engine can detect when an event can no longer match any rule due to its temporal constraints.
When that happens, the engine can safely delete the event from the session without side effects and release any resources used by that event.

There are basically 2 ways for the engine to calculate the matching window for a given event:

* explicitly, using the expiration policy
* implicitly, analyzing the temporal constraints on events
