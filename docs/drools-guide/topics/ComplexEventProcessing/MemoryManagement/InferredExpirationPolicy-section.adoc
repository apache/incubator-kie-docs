= Inferred expiration offset


Another way for the engine to calculate the expiration offset for a given event is implicitly, by analyzing the temporal constraints in the rules.
For instance, given the following rule:

.example rule with temporal constraints
====
[source]
----
rule "correlate orders"
when
    $bo : BuyOrderEvent( $id : id ) 
    $ae : AckEvent( id == $id, this after[0,10s] $bo )
then
    // do something
end
----
====


Analyzing the above rule, the engine automatically calculates that whenever a BuyOrderEvent matches, it needs to store it for up to 10 seconds to wait for matching AckEvent's.
So, the implicit expiration offset for BuyOrderEvent will be 10 seconds.
AckEvent, on the other hand, can only match existing BuyOrderEvent's, and so its expiration offset will be zero seconds.

The engine will make this analysis for the whole rulebase and find the offset for every event type. 



[IMPORTANT]
====
An explicit expiration policy for a given event type overrides any inferred expiration offset for that same type.
