An OpenShift template defines a set of objects that can be created by OpenShift. To change an environment configuration, you need to modify, add, or delete these objects. To simplify this task, comments are provided in the {PRODUCT} templates. 

Some comments mark blocks within the template, staring with ``BEGIN`` and ending with ``END``. For example, the following block is named `Sample block`:

----
## Sample block BEGIN
sample line 1
sample line 2
sample line 3
## Sample block END 
----

For some changes, you might need to replace a block in one template file with a block from another template file provided with {PRODUCT}. In this case, delete the block, then paste the new block in its exact location.
