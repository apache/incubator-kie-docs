= Environment with immutable servers
You can deploy an environment that includes several different pods running {KIE_SERVER} with preloaded processes. The database servers are, by default, also run in pods. Each {KIE_SERVER} pod can be separately scaled as necessary.

In this case, any processes (KJAR files) must be loaded onto a {KIE_SERVER} at the time the image is created. You cannot load or unload processes on a running {KIE_SERVER}. The advantage of this approach is that the {KIE_SERVER} with the processes in it runs like any other containerized service and does not require specialized management. You can use existing approaches to cloud integration to deploy and manage the servers.

Optionally, you can also deploy a pod with {CENTRAL} Monitoring and a pod with Smart Router. You can use {CENTRAL} Monitoring to start and stop (but not deploy) processes on your {KIE_SERVERS} and to view monitoring data. 

Smart Router is a single endpoint that can receive calls from client applications to any of your processes and route each call automatically to the server that actually runs the process.

When you create a {KIE_SERVER} image, you must build your processes using S2I (Source to Image). Provide a Git repository with the source of your processes and other business assets; if you develop the processes or assets in {CENTRAL}, copy the source into a separate repository for the S2I build. OpenShift automatically builds the source, installs the process into the {KIE_SERVER} image, and starts the process. No further management of the image is required. If you want to use a new version of the process, you can build a new image.

If you are using {CENTRAL} for authoring processes, you can extract the source for your process and place it into a separate Git repository (such as GitHub or an on-premise installation of GitLab) for use in the S2I build.

If you want to use {CENTRAL} Monitoring, you must install the Monitoring and Smart Router template _before_ creating any {KIE_SERVER} images. You must also provide a Maven repository. Your integration process must ensure that all the versions of KJAR files built into any {KIE_SERVER} image are also available in the Maven repository.
