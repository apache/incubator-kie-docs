+
[subs="verbatim,macros"]
----
git clone ssh://adminUser@bcHost:8001/MySpace/MyProject
----
+
Replace:
* `adminUser` with the administrative user for {CENTRAL}
* `bcHost` with the host on which {CENTRAL} is running
* `MySpace` with the name of the {CENTRAL} space in which the project is located
* `MyProject` with the name of the project
. Upload the source code to another Git repository for the S2I build.
