= Managing {PRODUCT} on OpenShift

You can scale {KIE_SERVER} on OpenShift as necessary. 

Do not scale {CENTRAL} on OpenShift. If you deploy {CENTRAL} and {KIE_SERVER} and then scale {KIE_SERVER}, the {CENTRAL} automatically manages all the copies of {KIE_SERVER}.

== Updating your decision service

When you want to update to a new version of your decision service, you can either use the existing pod to deploy the new version or create a new pod.

To change the decision service in an existing pod, you must manage the {KIE_SERVER} using {CENTRAL} or a stand-alone management console. In this case, changes are handled the same way as in an on-premise deployment without containers.

If you want to use a typical container application lifecycle, build a new pod to update your decision service. The Source to Image (S2I) deployment is usually most convenient for this solution.

To update a service on the same URL alias, use the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.7/dev_guide/deployments/deployment_strategies.html#recreate-strategy[recreate strategy]. {KIE_SERVER} does not support the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.7/dev_guide/deployments/deployment_strategies.html#rolling-strategy[rolling strategy].
