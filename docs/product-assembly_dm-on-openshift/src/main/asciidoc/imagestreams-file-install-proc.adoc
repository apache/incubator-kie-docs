= Ensuring the availability of image streams 

You must ensure that the image streams that are required for the deployment are available in your OpenShift environment. Some versions of the OpenShift environment include the necessary image streams. You must check if they are available. If they are not available, you must download and install the `image_streams.json` file.

.Procedure
. Run the following commands:
[subs="verbatim,macros"]
----
$ oc get imagestreamtag -n openshift | grep rhdm70-decisioncentral-openshift
$ oc get imagestreamtag -n openshift | grep rhdm70-kieserver-openshift
----
If the output of both commands is not empty, the required image streams are available and no furtehr action is required.
. If the output of one or both of the commands is empty, download  the `image-streams.json` file from {URL_BASE_GITHUB_DM}. Complete one of the following actions:

** Run the following command:
[subs="verbatim,macros"]
----
$ oc create -f image_streams.json
----

** Using the OpenShift Web UI, select *Add to Project > Import YAML / JSON*, then choose the file or paste its contents.
