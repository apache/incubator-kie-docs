= Ensuring the availability of image streams 

You must ensure that the image streams that are required for the deployment are available in your OpenShift environment. Some versions of the OpenShift environment include the necessary image streams. You must check if they are available. If they are not available, you must install the
ifdef::DM[`rhdm70-image-streams.yaml`]
ifdef::PAM[`rhpam70-image-streams.yaml`]
file.

.Procedure
. Run the following commands:
+
ifdef::DM[]
[subs="verbatim,macros"]
----
$ oc get imagestreamtag -n openshift | grep rhdm70-decisioncentral-openshift
$ oc get imagestreamtag -n openshift | grep rhdm70-kieserver-openshift
----
endif::DM[]
ifdef::PAM[]
[subs="verbatim,macros"]
----
$ oc get imagestreamtag -n openshift | grep rhpam70-businesscentral
$ oc get imagestreamtag -n openshift | grep rhpam70-kieserver
----
endif::PAM[]
+
If the outputs of both commands are not empty, the required image streams are available and no further action is required.
