= Deploying {KIE_SERVER} using Source to Image (S2I)

You can deploy {KIE_SERVER} on the OpenShift infrastructure using Source to Image (S2I). In this case, provide a Git repository with the source of your decision service. OpenShift automatically builds the source, installs the decision service into the {KIE_SERVER} image, and starts the service. No further management of the image is required. If you want to use a new version of the decision service, you can build a new image. This option is often preferable for typical version management approaches (DevOps) in a containerized infrastructure.

You can deploy {KIE_SERVER} using S2I with or without support for HTTPS. 

.Before you begin

Ensure that the complete source code for your decision service is available in a Git repository that the OpenShift server can access. The source code is built using a Maven process, so it must include a `pom.xml` file.

.Procedure
. In the OpenShift Web UI, select *Add to Project > Browse Catalog*, search for `decision`, and then select the *Red Hat Decision Manager Execution Server 7.0 S2I Ephemeral (no https)* or *Red Hat Decision Manager Execution Server 7.0 S2I (Ephemeral with https)* template.
** If this template is not available, download the `rhdm70-kieserver-basic-s2i.yaml` or `rhdm70-kieserver-https-s2i.yaml` file from {URL_BASE_GITHUB_DM}/templates . Select *Add to Project >  Import YAML / JSON* and then select or paste the `rhdm70-kieserver-s2i.yaml` file. In the *Add Template* window, ensure *Process the template* is selected and click *Continue*.
. Set the following mandatory parameters:
** *Application Name*: the name of the OpenShift application. It is used in the default URLs for {CENTRAL} and {KIE_SERVER}.
** *KIE Server Certificate Name*: the name of the certificate in the keystore that you created in <<secrets-kie-create-proc>>. Not available if you are configuring a server without HTTPS support.
** *KIE Server Keystore Password*: the password for the keystore that you created in <<secrets-kie-create-proc>>. Not available if you are configuring a server without HTTPS support.
** *KIE Server Container Deployment*: the identifying information of the decision service (KJAR file) that is built from your source. The format is: `<containerId>=<groupId>:<artifactId>:<version>`. You can provide two or more KJAR files using the `|` separator, for example: `containerId=groupId:artifactId:version|c2=g2:a2:v2`. The Maven build process must produce all these files from the source in the Git repository.
** *Git Repository URL*: the URL for the Git repository that contains the source for your decision service.
** *Git Reference*: the branch in the Git repository
** *Context Directory*: the path to the source within the project downloaded from the Git repository
** *Artefact Directory*: the path within the project that contains the required binary files (KJAR files and any other necessary files) after a successful Maven build. Normally this directory is the target directory of the build. However, you can provide prebuilt binaries in this directory in the Git repository
** *ImageStream Namespace*: the namespace where the image streams are available. If the image streams were already available in your OpenShift environment (see <<imagestreams-file-install-proc>>), the namespace is `openshift`. If you have installed the image streams file, the namespace is the name of the OpenShift project.
+
You can also set other parameters as necessary. In particular, if the Maven build of your decision service pulls packages from a Maven repository, you can set the URL for a mirror repository and, if necessary, set the username and password to access the mirror repository. In this case, the build process will pull packages from the mirror repository instead of the configured original repository:
+
*** *Maven mirror URL*
*** *Maven repository username*
*** *Maven repository password*
+
. Click *Create*.
