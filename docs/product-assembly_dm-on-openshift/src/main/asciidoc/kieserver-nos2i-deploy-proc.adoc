= Deploying {KIE_SERVER} without using Source to Image (S2I)


You can deploy {KIE_SERVER} on the OpenShift infrastructure without {CENTRAL} and without S2I. In this case, {KIE_SERVER} can pick up a decision service from a Maven repository. However, to load the service, you must manage the {KIE_SERVER} using one of the following tools:

* {CENTRAL}, installed outside of the OpenShift environment
* A stand-alone management console, installed outside of the OpenShift environment
* The API.

.Before you begin

Ensure that the Maven repository for your decision service is available.

If you are planning to use {CENTRAL} or a management console, ensure that it is installed and record its settings for controlling a KIE server.

.Procedure
. In the OpenShift Web UI, select *Add to Project > Browse Catalog*, search for `decision`, and then select the *Red Hat Decision Manager Execution Server 7.0 (Ephemeral with https)* template.
** If this template is not available, download the `rhdm70-kieserver.yaml` file from {URL_BASE_GITHUB_DM}/templates . Select *Add to Project >  Import YAML / JSON* and then select or paste the `rhdm70-kieserver.yaml` file. In the *Add Template* window, ensure *Process the template* is selected and click *Continue*.
. Set the following mandatory parameters:
** *Application Name*: the name of the OpenShift application. It is used in the default URLs for {CENTRAL} and {KIE_SERVER}.
** *KIE Server Certificate Name*: the name of the certificate in the keystore that you created in <<secrets-kie-create-proc>>.
** *KIE Server Keystore Password*: the password for the keystore that you created in <<secrets-kie-create-proc>>.
** *ImageStream Namespace*: the name of the OpenShift project.
+
You can also set other parameters as necessary. In particular:
* If you want to use {CENTRAL} or a stand-alone management console to manage the {KIE_SERVER}, set the following parameters according to the URL that you use to access the web user interface of the {CENTRAL} or of the management console:
+
** *KIE server controller protocol* (http or https)
** *KIE server controller host*
** *KIE server controller port*
+
* If you want to set the Maven repository for retrieving the decision service, set the following parameters to point to the repository:
+
** *Maven repository URL*
** *Maven repository username*
** *Maven repository password*
+
. Click *Create*.
