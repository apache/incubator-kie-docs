= Comparison: {PRODUCT} and {xpaasproduct-shortname}
This topic details the differences between {xpaasproduct-shortname} and the
full, non-PaaS release of {PRODUCT}, and provides instructions specific to running and
configuring {xpaasproduct-shortname}. Documentation for other {PRODUCT}
functionality not specific to {xpaasproduct-shortname} can be found in the
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-jboss-brms/[{PRODUCT} documentation on the Red Hat Customer Portal].

`_EAP_HOME_` in this documentation, as in the
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-jboss-brms/[{PRODUCT} documentation], is used to refer to the JBoss EAP installation directory
where the {KIE_SERVER} is deployed. The location of `_EAP_HOME_` inside {xpaasproduct-shortname} is *_/opt/eap/_*, which the `*JBOSS_HOME*`
environment variable is also set to by default.

== Functionality Differences for {xpaasproduct-shortname}

There are several major functionality differences in {xpaasproduct-shortname}:

* {xpaasproduct-shortname} extends EAP for OpenShift, and any capabilities or limitations it has are also found in {xpaasproduct-shortname}.
* Only stateless scenarios are supported.
* To connect to the {KIE_SERVER} web console, click the *Connect* button in the {KIE_SERVER} pod of the OpenShift web console, or the *Open Java Console* button in OpenShift 3.2.
* Authoring of any content through the {PRODUCT} Console or API is not supported.

== Managing {xpaasproduct-shortname}

As {xpaasproduct-shortname} is built off EAP for OpenShift, the JBoss EAP Management CLI
is accessible from within the container for troubleshooting purposes.

. First open a remote shell session to the running pod:
+
----
$ oc rsh <pod_name>
----
+
. Then run the following from the remote shell session to launch the JBoss EAP
Management CLI:
+
----
$ /opt/eap/bin/jboss-cli.sh
----

[WARNING]
Any configuration changes made using the JBoss EAP Management CLI on a running container will be lost when the container restarts.

link:#Making-Configuration-Changes-Decision-Server[Making configuration changes to the
JBoss EAP instance inside EAP for OpenShift] is different from the process you may be used to for a regular release of JBoss EAP.

[id='Security-Openshift-Decision-Server-xPaaS-Image']
= Security in {xpaasproduct-shortname}

Access is limited to users with the *_kie-server_* authorization role.  A user with this role
can be specified via the *_KIE_SERVER_USER_* and *_KIE_SERVER_PASSWORD_* environment variables.

[NOTE]
The HTTP/REST endpoint is configured to only allow the execution of KIE containers and querying
of KIE Server resources.  Administrative functions like creating or disposing Containers, updating
ReleaseIds or Scanners, etc. are restricted.  The JMS endpoint currently does not support these
restrictions.  In the future, more fine-grained security configuration should be available for
both endpoints.

== Version Compatibility and Support
See the xPaaS part of the https://access.redhat.com/articles/2176281[OpenShift and Atomic Platform Tested Integrations page] for details about OpenShift image version compatibility.

== Initial Setup
The Tutorials in this guide follow on from and assume an OpenShift instance similar to that created in the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-xpaas/0/openshift-primer/openshift-primer[OpenShift Primer].
