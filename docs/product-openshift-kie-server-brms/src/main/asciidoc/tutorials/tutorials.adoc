[[Tutorial-Deploying-RDS]]
= Example Workflow: Deploying {PRODUCT} Application on {xpaasproduct-shortname}
This tutorial prepares a {PRODUCT} application to be deployed as {xpaasproduct-shortname}. The {PRODUCT} application may require modification to be deployed as an image. 

*Preparing the Application* +
The {PRODUCT} project must be configured to have a stateless knowledge session, use a remote repository, and have defined KIE container deployment. +
Refer to the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_JBoss_BRMS/6.3/html/User_Guide[{USER_GUIDE}] for more information on any of these tasks.

. Log in to the {PRODUCT} console and edit the project settings in the *Project Explorer*.
. Click *Open Project Editor* and in the *Project Settings*:
.. Under *Knowledge bases and sessions*, ensure that the *Knowledge Session* is set to *Stateless*. OpenShift does not support stateful sessions on KIE servers.
.. Using *Repository View*, ensure the *pom.xml* is configured to use a remote repository by containing xml similar to the following: 
+
----
...
<distributionManagement>
  <repository>
    <id>deployment</id>
    <name>OpenShift Maven repo</name>
    <url>http://maven.example/content/repo/deployments/</url>
  </repository>

  <snapshotRepository>
    <id>deployment</id> 
    <name>OpenShift Maven repo</name>
    <url>http://maven.example.xas/content/repo/snapshots/</url>
  </snapshotRepository>
</distributionManagement>
...
----
+

. In the application's repository, ensure the *settings.xml* and the *.s2i/environment* files define the Maven repository and the KIE container deployment respectively:
.. The Maven repository should be defined in the *settings.xml* so that OpenShift can download the application artefacts. It should contain xml similar to the following: 
+
----
...
<profiles>
  <profile>
    <id>openshift-mirror-repositories</id>
    <repositories>
      <repository>
        <id>openshift-mirror</id>
        <url>http://maven.example/content/group/public/</url>
      </repository>
    </repositories>

    <pluginRepositories>
      <pluginRepository>
        <id>openshift-mirror</id>

.. The *.s2i/environment* file must define the KIE container deployment, including which KIE jars to use and the location from which to retrieve them. The pod name is derived from the deployment alias, which is defined as _DemoContainer_ in this example: 
+
----
KIE_CONTAINER_DEPLOYMENT_OVERRIDE=DemoContainer=com.example.openshift:example_workflow:1.0
----

== Preparing {KIE_SERVER} Deployment
. Create a new project: 
+
----
$ oc new-project rds-app-demo
----
. Create a service account to be used for the deployment of the {KIE_SERVER} application: 
+
----
$ oc create serviceaccount rds-service-account
----
. Add the view role to the service account. This enables the service account to view all the resources in the rds-app-demo namespace, which is necessary for managing the cluster. 
+
----
$ oc policy add-role-to-user view system:serviceaccount:rds-app-demo:rds-service-account
----
. The {KIE_SERVER} template requires an SSL keystore and a JGroups keystore. +
These keystores are expected even if the application will not use https. +
This example uses ‘keytool’, a package included with the Java Development Kit, to generate self-signed certificates for these keystores. The following commands will prompt for passwords. +
.. Generate a secure key for the SSL keystore: 
+
----
$ keytool -genkeypair -alias https -storetype JKS -keystore keystore.jks
----
.. Generate a secure key for the JGroups keystore: 
+
----
$ keytool -genseckey -alias jgroups -storetype JCEKS -keystore jgroups.jceks
----
. Use the SSL and JGroup keystore files to create the secret for the project: 
+
----
$ oc create secret generic rds-app-secret --from-file=jgroups.jceks --from-file=keystore.jks
----
. Add the secret to the service account created earlier: 
+
----
$ oc secret add sa/rds-service-account secret/rds-app-secret
----

== Deployment
. Log in to the OpenShift web console and select the _rds-app-demo_ project space.     
. Click *Add to Project* to list all of the default image streams and templates.
. Use the *Filter by keyword* search bar to limit the list to those that match `decisionserver`. You may need to click *See all* to show the desired application template.
. Select and configure the desired template and click *Deploy*.

During the build, the Maven repository is downloaded and build into the container so that no additional packages or dependencies are downloaded at runtime. 

The application is available once the pod is running. To connect to the {KIE_SERVER} web console, navigate to the pod and click *Open Java Console* button.

[[Tutorial-Adding_Updgraded_Version]]
= Example Workflow: Deploying an Upgraded Version Concurrently with Original Application

This example workflow follows on from link:#Tutorial-Deploying-RDS[Example Workflow: Deploying {PRODUCT} Application on {KIE_SERVER} xPaaS], in which the _1.0_ version of the _example_workflow_ artifact was deployed with a deployment alias of _DemoContainer_. This example deploys a _1.1_ version of the of the _example_workflow_ artifact alongside the _1.0_ version so that both versions of the _example_workflow_ artifact are running simultaneously, both with the _DemoContainer_ deployment alias. 

. Update the repository with the new version of the server. 
. Edit the *.s2i/environment* file for the application:
.. Change the *KIE_CONTAINER_DEPLOYMENT* variable to *KIE_CONTAINER_DEPLOYMENT_OVERRIDE*
.. Add the new version to the end of the value string, separated from the older version with a pipe.
+
----
KIE_CONTAINER_DEPLOYMENT_OVERRIDE=DemoContainer=com.example.openshift:example_workflow:1.0|DemoContainer=com.example.openshift:example_workflow:1.1
----
. Save the changes.
. If the project has link:https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.1/dev_guide/builds.html#webhook-triggers[GitHub Webhooks] configured, the new version will be deployed automatically alongside the older running applicaiton. Otherwise it can be manually built:
+
----
$ oc start-build rds-app-demo
----

Once the build has completed, the two different versions of the application will be running simultaneously using the same deployment alias. See link:#Request-Targeting[Request Targeting for Multiple Versions] for more information on how client requests are redirected to the correct version of the application.

[NOTE]
====
Make sure you are running {PRODUCT} on your local machine. 
====

[[tutorial-deploying-brms-on-openshift-forking]]
== Forking the Repository

. Visit the https://github.com/rettori/decisionserver[{KIE_SERVER} example]
page while you are logged in to GitHub.
. https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/[Fork the repository].
+
You are redirected to your new fork.
. Copy the HTTPS clone URL for your fork.

This {KIE_SERVER} example receives a name, and if it matches the user name
specified as *master* in the rules file, then the user is recognized and greeted
as the master user. If the name does not match, then the user is recognized as
an intruder.

[[tutorial-deploying-brms-on-openshift-cloning]]
== Cloning the Repository

From the {PRODUCT} workbench:
  
. From the File Explorer, click *Authoring* -> *Administration*.
. Click *Repositories* -> *Clone repository*.
. Type the *Repository Name* `decision-services`. 
. Select an *Organizational Unit*. 
. Type in the HTTPS clone URL of your forked Git repository: \https://github.com/_<Your_Github_Username>_/decisionserver.git
. Click *Clone*. 
+ 
Once cloned, the repository displays the commit history.

[[tutorial-deploying-brms-on-openshift-create-hook]]
== Creating a Hook to Automate GitHub Updates

To make {PRODUCT} automatically update your GitHub repository any time a file in this project changes:

[NOTE]
====
You must have SSH key access configured for GitHub before following these steps.
====

. From the command line, navigate into the `/.niogit` directory in the project you forked earlier:
+
----
$ cd EAPHOME/bin/.niogit/decision-services.git
----
+
The path above is the default, which may differ depending on where the workbench
has been configured to store its data. This location is set using the
*org.uberfire.nio.git.dir* system property. 
. Set the remote URL for this project:
+
----
$ git remote set-url origin git@github.com:/decisionserver
----
. Navigate into the hooks directory:
+
----
$ cd hooks
----
. Create a simple post-commit file:
+
----
$ touch post-commit
----
. Edit the file and type the following:
+
----
#!/bin/sh

git push origin master
----
. Save your changes and exit the file. 
. Change the permissions on the file to allow {PRODUCT} the access it requires:
+
----
$ chmod 777 post-commit
----
+ 
The hook is now configured, meaning that any change to the files in this {PRODUCT}
project will automatically update your forked *decisionserver* GitHub
repository.

[[tutorial-deploying-brms-on-openshift-modify-example]]
== Modifying the Example {KIE_SERVER} Rules

From the {PRODUCT} workbench:

. Click *Authoring* -> *Project authoring*. 
. Under *DRL*, click to load the *HelloRules.drl* file:
+
----
package org.openshift.quickstarts.decisionserver.hellorules

query "get greeting"()
    greeting : Greeting()
end

rule "greet master"
    when
        person : Person( name == "john")
    then
        String salutation = "Hello " + person.getName() + "! What can I help you with today?";
        insert(new Greeting(salutation));
end
rule "greet strangers"
    when
        person : Person(name != "john")
    then
        String salutation = "Hey there " + person.getName() + ". I don't think I know you yet!";
        insert(new Greeting (salutation));
end
----
. Modify the lines with `john` by replacing them with your user name.
. Click *Save*, type a check in comment, and click *Save* again.
+ 
The hook you created earlier will automatically update your forked GitHub
repository with these saved changes.


[[tutorial-deploying-brms-on-openshift-create-decision-service]]
== Creating a Decision Service on OpenShift

From the OpenShift web console:

. Log in using the username and password recommended to you by your
administrator.
. To create a new project, click *New Project*.
. Type a unique name, display name, and description for the new project.
. Click *Create*.
+
The web console's welcome screen loads.
. Click *Add to Project*.
. In the *Filter by keyword* field, start typing `decision` to see the available
xPaaS templates related to {KIE_SERVER}. 
. Click the *decisionserver63-basic-s2i* template.
. In the *Parameters* section, change the *KIE_SERVER_PASSWORD* to the password
to access the KIE Server REST or JMS interface.
. Change the *SOURCE_REPOSITORY_URL* to the Git source URI for your forked
repository. For example:
+
----
https://github.com/<your_github_username>/decisionserver.git
----
. Change the *SOURCE_REPOSITORY_REF* to `master`. 
. Change the *CONTEXT_DIR* to `greeting`. 
. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click *Create*. 

While your application builds, you can click *View Log* from the Overview page
to see the build progress. 

[[tutorial-deploying-brms-on-openshift-improve-build-time]]
== Improving Build Time Using Maven

Follow the details in
link:https://blog.openshift.com/improving-build-time-java-builds-openshift/[this OpenShift blog post] 
to configure the Maven proxy, which improves the build times of java
builds on OpenShift.

[[tutorial-deploying-brms-on-openshift-maven-proxy]]
== Integrating the Maven Proxy

To change the build configuration so that it uses the Maven proxy, complete the following from the OpenShift web console:

. Click *Browse* -> *Builds* -> *_<your_application>_*
. Click the three vertical dots next to *Start Build* and then click *Edit
(Raw)*.
. Add the *MAVEN_MIRROR_URL* environment variable below the
*KIE_CONTAINER_DEPLOYMENT* variable:
+ 
----
strategy
 sourceStrategy:
  env:
   - 
    name: KIE_CONTAINER_DEPLOYMENT
    value: 'HelloRulesContainer=org.openshift.quickstarts:decisionserver-hellorules:1.2.0.Final'
   -
    name: MAVEN_MIRROR_URL
    value: 'http://nexus-ci.cloudapps.bos.openshift3roadshow.com/content/groups/public/'
----
+ 
The value for *MAVEN_MIRROR_URL* can be found in Maven by viewing the
repositories, then copying the path for the Public Repositories group.
. Click *Save*.
. Click the *Configuration* tab of your build to verify that *MAVEN_MIRROR_URL*
is actively listed under Environment Variables.

Now that you have Maven configured for this OpenShift project, the build process
will be shorter for all future builds. This is because subsequent builds only
need to download updated files, which are then combined with the previously
loaded files.

[[tutorial-deploying-brms-on-openshift-test-service]]
== Test the Service

After integrating the Maven proxy, you can test that service is working and see
how quickly the build process completes compared to previous builds. From the
OpenShift web console:

. Click *Browse* -> *Builds* -> *_<your_application>_*
. Click *Start Build*.
. In the list at the bottom of the screen, click the new build you just started.
. Click the *Logs* tab, then click *Follow*. 
. Verify that the new build is using the new Maven proxy to download locally by
finding the line in the log that references `Downloading`. For example:
+
----
I0130 12:32:25.664594     1 sti.go:492] Downloading: http://nexus-ci.cloudapps.openshift.com/content/groups/public/org/kie/kie-maven-plugin/6.3.0.Final-redhat-5/kie-maven-plugin-6.3.0.Final-redhat-5.pom
----
. When the build is complete, you can check the new build time against the
previous build by clicking *Browse* -> *Builds* -> *_<your_application>_* and
viewing the summary. The newest build will be considerably shorter with the
Maven proxy in use.
. Click *Overview* to see the status of the pod. It displays a `Not Ready` status while it is checked with readiness probes. 
. Click *Browse* -> *Pods* to follow its progress. The status of the *Containers Ready* column will change to `1/1` when the pod has passed the readiness probes.

[[tutorial-deploying-brms-on-openshift-config-openshift-webhook]]
== Configure the OpenShift Webhook

From the OpenShift web console:

. Click the *Browse* tab, then click *Builds*.
. Click your build name, then click the *Configuration* tab. 
. Click the copy icon next to *GitHub webhook URL* to copy your webhook payload URL.
. Navigate to your forked repository on GitHub, then click *Settings*.
. Click *Webhooks & Services*.
. Click *Add webhook*.
. Paste your webhook URL into the *Payload URL* field.
. Click *Disable SSL verification*, then confirm it in the pop-up window.
. Click *Add webhook* to save.

Github pings the OpenShift server to ensure communication is successful. A green
check mark next to the webhook URL signifies that it is configured correctly.
Hover your cursor over the check mark to view the status of the last ping. 

The next time you push a code change to your forked repository, your application
will automatically rebuild.

[[tutorial-deploying-brms-on-openshift-test-configured-hooks]]
== Testing the Configured Hooks

From the {PRODUCT} workbench:

. Load the *HelloRules.drl* file:
+
----
package org.openshift.quickstarts.decisionserver.hellorules

query "get greeting"()
    greeting : Greeting()
end

rule "greet master"
    when
        person : Person( name == "john")
    then
        String salutation = "Hello " + person.getName() + "! What can I help you with today?";
        insert(new Greeting(salutation));
end
rule "greet strangers"
    when
        person : Person(name != "john")
    then
        String salutation = "Hey there " + person.getName() + ". I don't think I know you yet!";
        insert(new Greeting (salutation));
end
----
. Modify the String salutation line by changing `At your service my master` to something else.
. Click *Save*, type a check-in comment, and click *Save* again.

The hook that you created earlier updates your forked GitHub repository,
and then the GitHub webhook triggers a new build in OpenShift.

With this configuration, you need only save your configuration changes on the
{PRODUCT} workbench, and the rest of the process is completely
automated.
