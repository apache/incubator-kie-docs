= Defining KIE Bases and Sessions

A _KIE base_ contains rules, processes, functions, and type models. A KIE base does not contain runtime data, instead sessions are created from the KIE base into which data can be inserted and process instances started.

A _KIE session_ stores runtime data created from a KIE base. For more information, see {URL_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE}#sect_kie_sessions[KIE Sessions] of the _{DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE}_.

You can define KIE bases and sessions by editing the `kmodule.xml` file in the *Project View* of the project.

.Procedure

. Below *Knowledge Sessions*, click *Add* and enter the name of your session.
. Mark it `Default` and select appropriate state. For Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite, use `stateful` sessions.
