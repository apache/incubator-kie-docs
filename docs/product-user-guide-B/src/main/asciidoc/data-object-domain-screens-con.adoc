The *Drools & jBPM* screen allows configuration of Drools-specific attributes.

The Data Modeler in Business Central supports editing of the pre-defined annotations of fact model classes and attributes.
The following Drools annotations are supported, and can be customized using the *Drools & jBPM* interface:

* [property]``TypeSafe``
* [property]``ClassReactive``
* [property]``PropertyReactive``
* [property]``Role``
* [property]``Timestamp``
* [property]``Duration``
* [property]``Expires``
* [property]``Remotable``
