= Adding THEN Actions in Guided Rules

The *THEN* part of the rule is the action to be performed when the *WHEN* condition of the rule has been met. For example, when a loan applicant is under 21 years old, the *THEN* action might set `approved` to `false`, declining the loan because the applicant is under age. You can set simple or complex actions to determine how and when your rules are applied.
