= Data Models

Data models are models of data objects. A data object is a custom complex data type (for example, a Person object with data fields Name, Address, and Date of Birth).

Data models are saved in data models definitions stored in your Project. {PRODUCT} provides the Data Modeler, a custom graphical editor, for defining data objects.
