= Using External Data in Enumerations

You can use a list of strings from an external source in an enumeration for your project. This enables you to configure project assets with value options beyond what you have created in your project package.

.Procedure
Define the external source and type of data to be retrieved in the classpath that returns a [class]``java.util.List`` (of strings). Instead of specifying a list of values in the user interface, the code returns the list of strings.

For example, enter the following to retrieve a list of defined ages:

[source]
----
'Person.age' : (new com.yourco.DataHelper()).getListOfAges()
----

This assumes you have a class called [class]``DataHelper`` with a method [method]``getListOfAges()`` that returns a list of strings.

This also assumes that the external source contains a defined list of ages that can be retrieved, as in the following example:

[source]
----
'Person.age' : ['20','25', '30', '35']
----

The data enumerations are loaded the first time a guided editor in Business Central is used in a session. You will be notified of any errors in the transfer of the external data.
