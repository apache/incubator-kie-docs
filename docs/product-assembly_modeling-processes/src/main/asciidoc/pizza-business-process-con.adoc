= Creating a Business Process

A business process is a graph that describes the order in which a series of steps must be executed using a flow chart. A business process consists of a collection of nodes that are linked to each other using connections. Each of the nodes represents one step in the overall process while the connections specify how to transition from one node to the other. {PRODUCT} contains a predefined selection of node types to simplify business process creation.
