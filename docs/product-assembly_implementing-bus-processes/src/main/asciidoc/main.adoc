// Purpose statement for the assembly
As a citizen developer who wants to build rule-based solutions quickly, you can use {CENTRAL} in {PRODUCT} to design a variety of business processes. A business process is a graph that describes the order in which a series of steps must be executed using a flow chart.
A process consists of a collection of predefined node types that are linked to each other using connections.
Each of the nodes represents one step in the overall process while the connections specify how to transition from one node to the other.

Per chat with Christy:
Tell them How to create a business process. How to do that and why they would select importing, modifying, creating

Generic doc of how to do this. Simple start point including all the steps they have to complete to make a business process. For example, project creation/import, data objects, define business rules, decision tables, forms/generating auto option, and deploy, execute the new process.
