= Create the employee roster planning solution

The employee roster problem relies on a defined planning solution. The planning solution is defined in the domain editor using the attributes available in the {PLANNER} dock. 

.Prerequisite
* You have created the relevant data objects required to run the employee rostering example by completing the procedure in <<wb-employee-rostering-data-model-proc>>.

.Procedure
. Create a new data object with the identifier `EmployeeRoster`.
. Create the following assets:
+
* `dayOffRequest`: `employeerostering.employeerostering.DayOffRequest[List]`
* `shiftAssignmentList`: `employeerostering.employeerostering.ShiftAssignment[List]`
* `shiftList`: `employeerostering.employeerostering.Shift[List]`
* `skillList`: `employeerostering.employeerostering.Skill[List]`
* `timeslotList`: `employeerostering.employeerostering.Timeslot[List]`
. In the *Data Objects* perspective, open the {PLANNER} dock by clicking the image:planner-icon.png[] on the right.
. Select *Planing Solution*.
. Leave the default `Hard soft score` as the *Solution Score Type*. This automatically generates a `score` asset in the `EmployeeRoster` data object with the solution score as the type.
. Add a new field with the following attributes: 
+
* `employeeList`: `employeerostering.employeerostering.Employee[List]`
. With the `employeeList` field selected, open the {PLANNER} dock and select the *Planning Value Range Provider* box. 
+
In the *id* field, type `employeeRange`. Close the dock.
. Click *Save* in the upper right corner to save the asset.
