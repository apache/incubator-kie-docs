= Create the employee roster planning solution

The employee roster problem relies on a defined planning solution. The planning solution is defined in the domain designer using the attributes available in the {PLANNER} dock. 

.Prerequisite
* You have created the relevant data objects and planning entity required to run the employee rostering example by completing the procedures in <<wb-employee-rostering-data-model-proc>> and <<wb-employee-rostering-planning-entity-proc>>.

.Procedure
. Create a new data object with the identifier `EmployeeRoster`.
. Create the following fields:
+
.EmployeeRoster
[cols="1.1",options="header"]
|===
| id | Type 
| `dayOffRequestList` | `employeerostering.employeerostering.DayOffRequest[List]`
|`shiftAssignmentList` | `employeerostering.employeerostering.ShiftAssignment[List]`
| `shiftList` | `employeerostering.employeerostering.Shift[List]`
| `skillList` | `employeerostering.employeerostering.Skill[List]`
| `timeslotList` | `employeerostering.employeerostering.Timeslot[List]`
|===
. In the *Data Objects* perspective, open the {PLANNER} dock by clicking the image:optimizer-icon.png[{PLANNER} icon] on the right.
. Select *Planing Solution*.
. Leave the default `Hard soft score` as the *Solution Score Type*. This automatically generates a `score` field in the `EmployeeRoster` data object with the solution score as the type.

+

[cols="1.1",options="header"]
|===
| id | Type 
| `employeeList` | `employeerostering.employeerostering.Employee[List]`
|===

. With the `employeeList` field selected, open the {PLANNER} dock and select the *Planning Value Range Provider* box. 
+
In the *id* field, type `employeeRange`. Close the dock.
. Click *Save* in the upper-right corner to save the asset.
