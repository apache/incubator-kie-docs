= Embedding Workbench in Your Application

Apart from the individual perspectives (such as the Library or Content Management), the Workbench provides a number of editors used for designing and managing assets in different formats. Within the Workbench, each asset type has a corresponding editor.

The Workbench provides the possibility to embed the perspectives and editors in the user's application using the *standalone mode*. Without actually switching to the Workbench, it is possible to display perspectives and edit various assets, such as rules, processes, or decision tables, in separate applications.

To embed a part of the Workbench in an application, the Workbench must be deployed and running on a web server or an application server. Then, in your application, include an inline frame with the proper HTTP query parameters as described in the following table.
