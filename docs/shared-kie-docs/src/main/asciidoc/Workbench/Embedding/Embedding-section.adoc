= Embedding Workbench In Your Application


As we already know, Workbench provides a set of editors to author assets in different formats.
According to asset`'s format a specialized editor is used.

One additional feature provided by Workbench is the ability to embed it in your own (Web) Applications thru it's *standalone* mode.
So, if you want to edit rules, processes, decision tables, etc... in your own applications without switch to Workbench, you can.

In order to embed Workbench in your application all you'll need is the Workbench application deployed and running in a web/application server and, from within your own web applications, an iframe with proper HTTP query parameters as described in the following table.
