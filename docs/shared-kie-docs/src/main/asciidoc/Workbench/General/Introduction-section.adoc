[[_wb.workbenchconcepts]]
== Workbench concepts


The Workbench is comprised of different logical entities: 

* Part
+ 
A Part is a screen or editor with which the user can interact to perform operations.
+ 
Example Parts are "Project Explorer", "Project Editor", "Guided Rule Editor" etc.
* Page
+ 
A perspective is a logical grouping of related Panels and Parts. A perspective is usually named as _page_, since it is
a term far more familiar to end users whereas a perspective is more developer oriented. Notice however, the Workbench
supports both developer created pages and those created by end users from the page builder (aka Content Management)
tooling but, generally speaking, _page_ is used to refer both.
+ 
The user can switch between pages by clicking on one of the top-level menu items; such as "Home", "Authoring", "Deploy" etc.
