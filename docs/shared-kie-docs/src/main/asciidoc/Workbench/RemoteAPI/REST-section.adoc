= REST


REST API calls to Knowledge Store allow you to manage the Knowledge Store content and manipulate the static data in the repositories of  the Knowledge Store.
The calls are asynchronous, that is, they continue their execution as a job after a call was performed.
The job ID  is returned by every call to allow (after the REST API call was performed) to request the job status and verify whether the job finished successfully.
Parameters of these calls are provided in the form of JSON entities. 

When using Java code to interface with the REST API, the classes used in POST operations or otherwise returned by various operations can be found in the `(org.kie.workbench.services:)kie-wb-common-services` JAR.
All  of the classes mentioned below can be found in the `org.kie.workbench.common.services.shared.rest` package in that JAR.

== Job calls


Every Knowledge Store REST call returns its job ID after it was sent.
This is necessary as the calls are asynchronous and you need  to be able to reference the job to check its status as it goes through its lifecycle.
During its lifecycle, a job can have the  following statuses: 

* ``ACCEPTED``: the job was accepted and is being processed
* ``BAD_REQUEST``: the request was not accepted as it contained incorrect content
* ``RESOURCE_NOT_EXIST``: the requested resource (path) does not exist
* ``DUPLICATE_RESOURCE``: the resource already exists
* ``SERVER_ERROR``: an error on the server occurred
* ``SUCCESS``: the job finished successfully
* ``FAIL``: the job failed
* ``DENIED``: the job was denied
* ``GONE``: the job ID could not be found
+ 
A job can be GONE in the following cases:
** The job was explicitly removed
** The job finished and has been deleted from the status cache (the job is removed from status cache after the cache  has reached its maximum capacity)
** The job never existed


The following `job` calls are provided:

[GET] `/jobs/__{jobID}__`::
  Returns the job status

[DELETE] `/jobs/__{jobID}__`::
  Removes the job: If the job is not yet being processed, this will remove the job from the job queue.
  However, this will not cancel or stop an ongoing job

== Repository calls


Repository calls to the Knowledge Store allow you to manage Git repositories and projects inside them.

The following `repositories` calls are provided:

[GET] `/repositories`::
  Gets information about the repositories in the Knowledge Store

[GET] `/repositories/{repositoryName}`::
  Gets information about the repository

[POST] `/repositories`::
  Creates a new empty repository or a new repository cloned from an existing (git) repository defined by `RepositoryRequest` JSON entity

[DELETE] `/repositories/__{repositoryName}__`::
  Removes the repository from the Knowledge Store

[GET] `/repositories/__{repositoryName}__/projects/`::
  Gets information about all projects in the repository

[POST] `/repositories/__{repositoryName}__/projects/`::
  Creates a project in the repository defined by `ProjectRequest` JSON entity

[DELETE] `/repositories/__{repositoryName}__/projects/__{projectName}__`::
  Deletes the project in the repository

== Organizational unit calls


Organizational unit calls to the Knowledge Store allow you to manage organizational units and organize the connected Git repositories.

The following `organizationalUnits` calls are provided:

[GET] `/organizationalunits`::
  Gets all organizational units

[GET] `/organizationalunits/__{organizationalUnitName}__`::
  Gets a single organizational unit

[POST] `/organizationalunits`::
  Creates an organizational unit described by `OrganizationalUnit` JSON entity

[POST] `/organizationalunits/__{organizationalUnitName}__`::
  Updates the organizational unit described by `OrganizationalUnit` JSON entity

[DELETE] `/organizationalunits/__{organizationalUnitName}__`::
  Deletes the organizational unit

[POST] `/organizationalunits/__{organizationalUnitName}__/repositories/__{repositoryName}__`::
  Adds the repository to the organizational unit

[DELETE] `/organizationalunits/__{organizationalUnitName}__/repositories/__{repositoryName}__`::
  Removes the repository from the organizational unit

== Maven calls


Maven calls to a project in the Knowledge Store allow you compile, test, install, and deploy projects.

The following `maven` calls are provided:

[POST] `/repositories/__{repositoryName}__/projects/__{projectName}__/maven/compile`::
  Compiles the project (equivalent to ``mvn compile``)

[POST] `/repositories/__{repositoryName}__/projects/__{projectName}__/maven/test`::
  Tests the project (equivalent to ``mvn test``)

[POST] `/repositories/__{repositoryName}__/projects/__{projectName}__/maven/install`::
  Installs the project (equivalent to ``mvn install``)

[POST] `/repositories/__{repositoryName}__/projects/__{projectName}__/maven/deploy`::
  Deploys the project (equivalent to  ``mvn deploy``)
