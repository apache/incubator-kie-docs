A workbench is structured with Organization Units, VFS repositories and projects:

== Organizational unit


Organization units are useful to model departments and divisions.

An organization unit can hold multiple repositories.

[[_wb.vfsrepository]]
== Repositories


Repositories are the place where assets are stored and each repository is organized by projects and belongs to a single organization unit. 

Repositories are in fact a Virtual File System based storage, that by default uses GIT as backend.
Such setup allows workbench to work with multiple backends and, in the same time, take full advantage of backend specifics features like in GIT case versioning, branching and even external access.

A new repository can be created from scratch or cloned from an existing repository.

One of the biggest advantage of using GIT as backend is the ability to clone a repository from external and use your preferred tools to edit and build your assets.

[WARNING]
====
*Never* clone your repositories directly from <<_wb.systemproperties,$$.$$niogit>> directory.
Use always the available protocol(s) displayed in repositories editor.

One additional advantage to use GIT as backend is the possibility to revert your repository to a previous state.
You can do it directly from the repository editor by browsing its commit history and clicking the *Revert* button.
