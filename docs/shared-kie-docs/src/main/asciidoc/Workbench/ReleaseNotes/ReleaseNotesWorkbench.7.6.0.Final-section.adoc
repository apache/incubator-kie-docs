= New and Noteworthy in KIE Workbench 7.6.0

== Content management enhancements

A few extra changes have been introduced in the _Content Management_ tooling (aka _Page Authoring_) in order to
improve the user experience. The following screenshot reveals the changes introduced since the latest version.

=== Fluid/Page editor mode selection

The new page pop up allows for the selection of two edition modes:

* **Fluid**: it acts more as a classical web page, showing a vertical scrollbar when the page exceeds the available height.

* **Page**: it was the default in previous versions. When selected, it forces the page to always fit the window's 100% height.

=== Preview feature

Page authors can go back and forth from the _Editor_ to the _Preview_ mode as many times as needed. In the _Preview_ mode
all the editor's controls are removed, allowing for the display of the page as it would be seen by end
users once the page is published.

=== Use dock panels to increase the editor content area

Both the page listing and the navigation configuration panels along with the component palette have been move from the
editor's to docked panels on the left sidebar. The main goal is to increase the available space in the editor's central
area.

=== Component palette reorganization

In previous versions, there only existed one single category of components in the palette. As of
version 7.6, the components are now grouped into three main categories:

* _Core: HTM, Page and Screen components_
* _Navigation: Menu Bar, Tree, Tiles, Tab List, Carousel and Target Div
* _Reporting: Bar, Pie, Line, Area, Map, Bubble, Metric, Meter, Table and Filter

The goal of these changes it to makes the palette more appealing as well as to ease the selection of the target component to
drag.
