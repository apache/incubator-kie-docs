= New and Noteworthy in KIE Workbench 7.8.0

== New System Property for setting the Default Maven Repository in Project pom.xml files

To make building Workbench projects outside of the Workbench easier, it is now possible to set the URL for the default Maven Repository that is added into each new Project pom.xml. It is recommended that you set this before starting you Workbench for the first time.
