== Project Editor permissions


The ability to configure role-based permissions for the Project Editor have been added.

Permissions can be configured using the `WEB-INF/classes/workbench-policy.properties` file.

The following permissions are supported: 

* Save button
+ 
``feature.wb_project_authoring_save``
* Delete button
+ 
``feature.wb_project_authoring_delete``
* Copy button
+ 
``feature.wb_project_authoring_copy``
* Rename button
+ 
``feature.wb_project_authoring_rename``
* Build & Deploy button
+ 
``feature.wb_project_authoring_buildAndDeploy``


== Unify validation style in Guided Decision Table Wizard.


All of our new screens use GWT-Bootstrap widgets and alert users to input errors in a consistent way.

One of the most noticable differences was the Guided Decision Table Wizard that alerted errors in a way inconsistent with our use of GWT-Bootstrap.

This Wizard has been updated to use the new look and feel.

== Improved Wizards


During the re-work of the Guided Decision Table's Wizard to make it's validation consistent with other areas of the application we took the opportunity to move the Wizard Framework to GWT-Bootstrap too.

The resulting appearance is much more pleasing.
We hope to migrate more legacy editors to GWT-Bootstrap as time and priorities permit.

== Consistent behaviour of XLS, Guided Decision Tables and Guided Templates


Consistency is a good thing for everybody.
Users can expect different authoring metaphores to produce the same rule behaviour (and developers know when something is a bug!).

There were a few inconsistencies in the way XLS Decision Tables, Guidied Decision Tables and Guided Rule Templates generated the underlying rules for empty cells.
These have been eliminated making their operation consistent.

* If all constraints have null values (empty cells) the Pattern is not created.
+ 
Should you need the Pattern but no constraints; you will need to include the constraint ``this != null``.
+ 
This operation is consistent with how XLS and Guided Decision Tables have always worked.
* You can define a constraint on a String field for an empty String or white-space by delimiting it with double-quotation marks. The enclosing quotation-marks are removed from the value when generating the rules.
+ 
The use of quotation marks for other String values is not required and they can be omitted.
Their use is however essential to differentiate a constraint for an empty String from an empty cell - in which case the constraint is omitted.


== Improved Metadata Tab


The Metadata tab provided in previous versions was redesigned to provide a better asset versioning information browsing and recovery.
Now every workbench editor will provide an "Overview tab" that will enable the user to manage the following information.

* Versions history
+ 
The versions history shows a tabular view of the asset versions and provides a "Select" button that will enable the user to load a previously created version.

* Metadata
+ 
The metadata section gets access to additional file attributes.

* Comments area
+ 
The redesigned comments area enables much clearer discussions on a file.
* Version selection dropdown
+ 
The "Version selector dropdown" located at the menu bar provides the ability to load and restore previous versions from the "Editor tab", without having to open the "Overview tab" to load the "Version history".

== Improved Data Objects Editor


The Java editor was unified to the standard workbench editors functioning.
It means that and now every data object is edited on his own editor window.

.Improved Data Object Editor
image::Workbench/ReleaseNotes/NewJavaEditor.png[]


* "New -> Data Object" option was added to create the data objects.
* Overview tab was added for every file to manage the file metadata and have access to the file versions history.
* Editable "Source Tab" tab was added. Now the Java code can be modified by administrators using the workbench. 
* "Editor" - "Source Tab" round trip is provided. This will let administrators to do manual changes on the generated Java code and go back to the editor tab to continue working.
* Class usages detection. Whenever a Data Object is about to be deleted or renamed, the project will be scanned for the class usages. If usages are found (e.g. in drl files, decision tables, etc.) the user will receive an alert. This will prevent the user from breaking the project build.

== Execution Server Management UI


A new perspective called *Management* has been added under *Servers* top level menu.
This perspective provides users the ability to manage multiple execution servers with multiple containers.
Available features includes connect to already deployed execution servers; create new, start, stop, delete or upgrade containers.

[NOTE]
====
Current version of Execution Server just supports rule based execution.

== Social Activities


A brand new feature called *Social Activities* has been added under a new top level menu item group called **Activity**.

This new feature is divided in two different perspectives: *Timeline Perspective*  and **People Perspective**.

The *Timeline Perspective* shows on left side the recent assets created or edited by the logged user.
In the main window there is the "Latest Changes" screen, showing all the recent updated assets and an option to filter the recent updates by repository.

.Timeline Perspective

The *People Perspective* is the home page of an user.
Showing his infos (including a gravatar picture from user e-mail), user connections (people that user follow) and user recent activities.
There is also a way to edit an user info.
The search suggestion can be used to navigate to a user profile, follow him and see his updates on your timeline.

== Contributors Dashboard


A brand new perspective called *Contributors* has been added under a new top level menu item group called **Activity**.
The perspective itself is a dashboard which shows several indicators about the contributions made to the managed organizations / repositories within the workbench.
Every time a organization/repository is added/removed from the workbench the dashboard itself is updated accordingly.

This new perspective allows for the monitoring of the underlying activity on the managed repositories.

== Package selector


The location of new assets whilst authoring was driven by the context of the Project Explorer.

This has been replaced with a Package Selector in the New Resource Popup.

The location defaults to the Project Explorer context but different packages can now be more easily chosen.

== Improved visual consistency


All Popups have been refactored to use GWT-Bootstrap widgets.

Whilst a simple change it brings greater visual consistency to the application as a whole.

== Guided Decision Tree Editor


A new editor has been added to support modelling of simple decision trees.

See the applicable section within the User Guide for more information about usage.

== Create Repository Wizard


A wizard has been created to guide the repository creation process.
Now the user can decide at repository creation time if it should be a managed or unmanaged repository and configure all related parameters.

== Repository Structure Screen


The new Repository Structure Screen will let users to manage the projects for a given repository, as well as other operations related to managed repositories like: branch creation, assets promotion and project release.
