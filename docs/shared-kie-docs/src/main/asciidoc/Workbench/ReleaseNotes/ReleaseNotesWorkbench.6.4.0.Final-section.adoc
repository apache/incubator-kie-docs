= New and Noteworthy in KIE Workbench 6.4.0

== New look and feel


The general look and feel in the entire workbench has been updated to adopt https://www.patternfly.org/[PatternFly].
The update brings a cleaner, lightweight and more consistent user experience throughout every screen.
Allowing users focus on the data and the tasks by removing all uncessary visual elements.
Interactions and behaviors remain mostly unchanged, limiting the scope of this change to visual updates.

== Various UI improvements


In addition to the PatternFly update described above which targeted the general look and feel, many  individual components in the workbench have been improved to create a better user experience.
This involved  making sure the default size of modal popup windows is appropriate to fit the corresponding content, adjusting the size of text fields as well as aligning labels, and improving the resize behaviour of various components  when used on smaller screens.

== New locales


Locales `ru` (Russian) and `zh_TW` (Chineses Traditional) have now been added.

The locales now supported are: 

* Default English.
* `es` (Spanish)
* `fr` (French)
* `de` (German)
* `ja` (Japanese)
* `pt_BR` (Portuguese - Brazil)
* `zh_CN` (Chinese - Simplified)
* `zh_TW` (Chinese - Traditional)
* `ru` (Russian)


== Authoring - Imports - Consistent terminology


The Workbench used to have a section in the Project Editor for "Import Suggestions" which was really a way for Users to register classes provided by the Java Runtime environment to be available to Rule authoring.
Furthermore Editors had a "Config" tab which was where Users were expected to import classes from other packages to that in which the rule resides.

Neither term was clear and both were inconsistent with each other and other aspects of the Workbench.

We have changed these terms to (hopefully) be clearer in their meaning and to be consistent with the "Data Object" term used in relation to authoring Java classes within the Workbench.

.Asset Editors - Data Objects

The Data Object screen lists all Data Objects in the same package as the asset and allows other Data Objects from other packages to be imported.

== Disable automatic build


When navigating Projects with the Project Explorer the workbench automatically builds the selected project, displaying build messages in the  Message Console.
Whilst this is beneficial it can have a detremental impact on performance of the workbench when authoring large projects.
The  automatic build can now be disabled with the `org.kie.build.disable-project-explorer` System Property.
Set the value  to `true` to disable.
The default value is ``false``.

== Support for `SCP` style `git` Repository URLs


When cloning `git` Repositories it is now possible to use `SCP` style URLS, for example ``git@github.com:user/repository.git``.
If your Operating System's public keystore is password protected the passphrase can be provided with the `org.uberfire.nio.git.ssh.passphrase` System Property.

== Authoring - Duplicate GAV detection


When performing any of the following operations a check is now made against all Maven Repositories, resolved for the Project,  for whether the Project's GroupId, ArtifactId and Version pre-exist.
If a clash is found the operation is prevented; although this can be overridden by Users with the `admin` role.

[NOTE]
====
The feature can be disabled by setting the System Property `org.guvnor.project.gav.check.disabled` to ``true``.
====

Resolved repositories are those discovered in:

* The Project's `POM` ``<repositories>`` section (or any parent ``POM``).
* The Project's `POM` ``<distributionManagement>`` section.
* Maven's global `settings.xml` configuration file.

Affected operations:

* Creation of new Managed Repositories.
* Saving a Project defintion with the Project Editor.
* Adding new Modules to a Managed Multi-Module Repository.
* Saving the `pom.xml` file.
* Build & installing a Project with the Project Editor.
* Build & deploying a Project with the Project Editor.
* Asset Management operations building, installing or deloying Projects.
* `REST` operations creating, installing or deploying Projects.

Users with the `Admin` role can override the list of Repositories checked using the "Repositories" settings in the Project Editor.

== New Execution Server Management User Interface


The KIE Execution Server Management UI has been completely redesigned to adjust to major improvements introduced recently.
Besides the fact that new UI has been built from scratch and following best practices provided by PatternFly, the new interface expands previous features giving users more control of their servers.

== User and group management


Provides the backend services and an intuitive and friendly user interface that allows the workbench administrators to manage the application's users and groups.

This interface provides to the workbench administrators the ability to perform realm related operations such as create users, create groups, assign groups or roles to a given user, etc.

It comes by default with built-in implementations for the administration of Wildfly, EAP and Tomcat default realms, and it's designed to be extensible - any third party realm management system can be easily integrated into the workbench.
