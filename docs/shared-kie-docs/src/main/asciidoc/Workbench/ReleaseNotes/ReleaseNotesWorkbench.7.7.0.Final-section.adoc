[[_wb.releasenotesworkbench.7.7.0.final]]
= New and Noteworthy in KIE Workbench 7.7.0

== Connecting to a remote Kie Server Controller

When running a Workbench instance, there is now greater flexibility to decide how Kie Server instances will be managed.
Previously, whenever a Workbench is started, it would always start an embedded Kie Server Controller. This setup is still available
but now there is also an option to not start this service and instead connect to a remote Kie Server Controller.
This allows a more fine grained deployment model where it's possible to decide the best approach for a specific scenario.

To switch between these modes, a key system property is used: *org.kie.workbench.controller*. By default, the Workbench
will continue to start the embedded service if this system property is missing. Otherwise, it will try to connect to the remote
service and also ensure that none of the embedded services are started.

It is important to note that only Web Socket connection protocol is available to use when connecting to remote Kie Server Controller.

For more details regarding all possible system configs regarding user name, password, token and secured password via key store,
please refer to <<_wb.systemproperties, Workbench system properties>>.

== Content management enhancements

=== Properties panel

It is possible to edit the properties of the different page elements including, the page itself or any of its rows and components.
Once an element is selected, either by hovering on the element and clicking on the editor's area or selecting the element in the
_Properties_ panel dropdown, its properties are displayed in the left docked panel. See screenshot:

The properties available in this version are basically those related with the element style such as width, height or margins, amongst others.
The properties available might differ for each type. Notice for example, the HTML component provides an extra set of properties all related
with the text style.

Once a property is changed, its value is reflected in the editor's area, both in _design_ and _preview_ modes.

=== Screen component removed

The _Screen_ component, which was placed under the _Core_ group in the right sidebar's _Components_ panel, has been removed.
The reason is, this component was not suitable for production environments.

In future versions though, domain related components, such as a BPM's task list, will be available for easy consumption by end users.
