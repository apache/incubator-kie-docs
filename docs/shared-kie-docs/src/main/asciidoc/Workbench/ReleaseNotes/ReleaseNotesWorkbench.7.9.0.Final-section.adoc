== Moved ExecutableCommand to KIE public API

Drools internal `ExecutableCommand` interface has been moved to KIE public API. It's now possible to create custom
executable commands without rely on internal interface.

A deprecated internal `ExecutableCommand` interface still exists for backward compatibility and will be removed in a
future release.

WARNING: Existing custom commands based on old internal interface that override `canRunInTransaction()` method will no
longer compile due to this change.
