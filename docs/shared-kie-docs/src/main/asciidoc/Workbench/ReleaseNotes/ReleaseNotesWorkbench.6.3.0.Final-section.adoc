= New and Noteworthy in KIE Workbench 6.3.0

== Real Time Validation and Verification for the Decision Tables


Decision tables used to have a Validation-button for validating the table.
This is now removed and the table is validated after each cell value change.
The validation and verification checks include:

* Redundancy
* Subsumption
* Conflicts
* Missing Columns


These checks are explained in detail in the workbench documentation.

== Improved DRL Editor


The DRL Editor has undergone a face lift; moving from a plain TextArea to using ACE Editor and a custom DRL syntax highlighter.

== Asset locking


To avoid conflicts when editing assets, a new locking mechanism has been introduced that makes sure that only one user at a time can edit an asset.
When a user begins to edit an asset, a lock will automatically be acquired.
This is indicated by a lock symbol appearing on the asset title bar as well as in the project explorer view.
If a user starts editing an already locked asset a pop-up notification will appear to inform the user that the asset can't currently be edited, as it is being worked on by another user.
As long as the editing user holds the lock, changes by other users will be prevented.
Locks will automatically be released when the editing user saves or closes the asset, or logs out of the workbench.
Every user further has the option to force a lock release in the metadata tab, if required.

== Data Modeller Tool Windows


Drools and jBPM configurations, Persistence (see Generation of JPA enabled Data Models) and Advanced configurations were moved into "Tool Windows". "Tool Windows" are a new concept introduced in latest Uberfire version that enables the development of context aware screens.
Each "Tool Window" will contain a domain editor that will manage a set of related Data Object parameters.

== Generation of JPA enabled Data Models


Data modeller was extended to support the generation of persistable Data Objects.
The persistable Data Objects are based on the JPA specification and all the underlying metadata are automatically generated. 

* "The New -> Data Object" Data Objects can be marked as persistable at creation time.

* The Persistence tool window contains the JPA Domain editors for both Data Object and Field. Each editor will manage the by default generated JPA metadata

== Data Set Authoring


A new perspective for authoring data set definitions has been added.
Data set definitions make it possible to retrieve data from external systems like databases, CSV/Excel files or even use a Java class to generate the data.
Once the data is available it can be used, for instance, to create charts and dashboards from the Perspective Editor just feeding the charts from any of the data sets available.
