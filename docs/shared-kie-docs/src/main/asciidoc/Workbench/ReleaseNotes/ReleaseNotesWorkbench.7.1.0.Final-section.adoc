== Project Metrics Dashboard

A brand new dashboard is now available for every project listed in the authoring library. After opening the project details page, a metrics card shows up on the right side of the screen.

The cards shows the history of contributions (commits) made to that specific project over time.
Clicking on the _View All_ link gives access to the full dashboard which shows several metrics all about the project's contributions.

Notice that different filter controls are available for selecting the contributions made either by a concrete user or in a specific time frame.
