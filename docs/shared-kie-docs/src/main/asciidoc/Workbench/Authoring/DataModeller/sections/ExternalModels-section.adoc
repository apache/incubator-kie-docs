= Using external models


Using an external model means the ability to use a set for already defined POJOs in current project context.
In order to make those POJOs available a dependency to the given JAR should be added.
Once the dependency has been added the external POJOs can be referenced from current project data model. 

There are two ways to add a dependency to an external JAR file:

* Dependency to a JAR file already installed in current local M2 repository (typically associated the the user home). 
* Dependency to a JAR file installed in current KIE Workbench/Drools Workbench "Guvnor M2 repository". (internal to the application) 


== Dependency to a JAR file in local M2 repository


To add a dependency to a JAR file in local M2 repository follow this steps. 

=== Open the Project Editor for current project and select the Dependencies view.

=== Click on the "Add" button to add a new dependency line.

=== Complete the GAV for the JAR file already installed in local M2 repository.

=== Save the project to update its dependencies.


When project is saved the POJOs defined in the external file will be available.

== Dependency to a JAR file in current "Guvnor M2 repository".


To add a dependency to a JAR file in current "Guvnor M2 repository" follow this steps. 

=== Open the Maven Artifact Repository editor.

=== Browse your local file system and select the JAR file to be uploaded using the Browse button.

=== Upload the file using the Upload button.

.File upload success.

=== Guvnor M2 repository files.


Once the file has been loaded it will be displayed in the repository files list.

=== Provide a GAV for the uploaded file (optional).


If the uploaded file is not a valid Maven JAR (don't have a pom.xml file) the system will prompt the user in order to provide a GAV for the file to be installed. 

.Not valid POM.

.Enter GAV manually.

=== Add dependency from repository.


Open the project editor (see bellow) and click on the "Add from repository" button to open the JAR selector to see all the installed JAR files in current "Guvnor M2 repository". When the desired file is selected the project should be saved in order to make the new dependency available. 

.Select JAR from "Maven Artifact Repository".

== Using the external objects


When a dependency to an external JAR has been set, the external POJOs can be used in the context of current project data model in the following ways: 

* External POJOs can be extended by current model data objects. 


* External POJOs can be used as field types for current model data objects. 


The following screenshot shows how external objects are prefixed with the string " -ext- " in order to be quickly identified.
