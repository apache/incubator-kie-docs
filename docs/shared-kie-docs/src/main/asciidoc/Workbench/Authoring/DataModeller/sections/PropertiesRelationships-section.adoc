Once the data object has been created, it now has to be completed by adding user-defined properties to its definition.
This can be achieved by pressing the "add field" button.
The "New Field" dialog will be opened and the new field can be created by pressing the "Create" button.
The "Create and continue" button will also add the new field to the Data Object, but won't close the dialog.
In this way multiple fields can be created avoiding the popup opening multiple times.
The following fields can (or must) be filled out: 

* The field's internal identifier (mandatory). The value of this field must be unique per data object, i.e. if the proposed identifier already exists within current data object, an error message will be displayed. 
* A label (optional): as with the data object definition, the user can define a user-friendly label for the data object field which is about to be created. This has no further implications on how fields from objects of this data object will be treated. If a label is defined, then this is how the field will be displayed throughout the data modeller tool. 
* A field type (mandatory): each data object field needs to be assigned with a type. 
+ 
This type can be either of the following:
+
.. A 'primitive java object' type: these include most of the object equivalents of the standard Java primitive types, such as Boolean, Short, Float, etc, as well as String, Date, BigDecimal and BigInteger.

+
+
.. A 'data object' type: any user defined data object automatically becomes a candidate to be defined as a field type of another data object, thus enabling the creation of relationships between them. A data object field can be created either in 'single' or in 'multiple' form, the latter implying that the field will be defined as a collection of this type, which will be indicated by selecting "List" checkbox.

.. A 'primitive java' type: these include java primitive types byte, short, int, long, float, double, char and boolean.

When finished introducing the initial information for a new field, clicking the 'Create' button will add the newly created field to the end of the data object's fields table below:

The new field will also automatically be selected in the data object's field list, and its properties will be shown in the Field general properties editor.
Additionally the field properties will be loaded in the different tool windows, in this way the field will be ready for edition in whatever selected tool window. 

At any time, any field (without restrictions) can be deleted from a data object definition by clicking on the corresponding 'x' icon in the data object's fields table.
