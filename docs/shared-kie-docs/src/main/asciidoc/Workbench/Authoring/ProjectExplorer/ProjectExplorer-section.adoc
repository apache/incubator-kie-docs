.Showing packages
image::Workbench/Authoring/ProjectExplorer/ProjectExplorer-Project-Show-Packages.png[align="center"]


After a suitable combination of Organizational Unit, Repository, Project and Package have been selected the Project Explorer will show the contents.
The exact combination of selections depends wholly on the structures defined within the Workbench installation and projects.
Each section contains groups of related files.
If a file is currently being edited by another user, a lock symbol will be displayed in front of the file name.
The symbol is blue in case the lock is owned by the currently authenticated user, otherwise black.
Moving the mouse pointer over the lock symbol will display a tooltip providing the name of the user who is currently editing the file (and therefore owning the lock). To learn more about locking see <<_wb.asseteditor>>
 for details.

In cases that your change had an unexcepcted impact, Workbench allows you to restore your repository using the <<_wb.vfsrepositoryeditor,Repository
        editor>>.

Files locked by other users as well as directories that contain such files cannot be renamed or deleted until the corresponding locks are released.
If that is the case the rename and delete symbols will be deactivated.
