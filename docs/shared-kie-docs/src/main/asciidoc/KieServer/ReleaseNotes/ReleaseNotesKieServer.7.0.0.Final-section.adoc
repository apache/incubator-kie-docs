= Breaking changes in Kie Server 7.0 from 6.x

== ServiceResponse XStream marshalling changes

NOTE: This release note applies only when directly interfacing with the Kie Server (kie-server) API, not when using the Kie Server Java Client (kie-server-client) API.

In an effort to be more consistent with JAXB marshalling, XStream marshalling has undergone the following changes:

- The XML ServiceResponse element's `response` object no longer renders with the canonical name.
- XStream now uses `type` and `msg` as attributes, not child elements.

For more details, see https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DROOLS-1509[DROOLS-1509].
