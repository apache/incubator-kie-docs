= Breaking changes in Drools 7.0 from 6.x

== ServiceResponse XStream marshalling changes

NOTE: This note is relevant only when interfacing with the kie-server API directly. This change is transparent if the application is using the Kie Server Java Client API (kie-serer-client).

The ServiceResponse element xml XStream marshalling has been changed in order to resolve inconsistencies with JAXB marshalling.
Full details are described in https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DROOLS-1509[DROOLS-1509].
