= Managing Containers


Containers within the Execution Server can be started, stopped and updated from within KIE Workbench.⁠ 

== Starting a Container


Once registered, a Container is in the 'Stopped' mode.
It can be started by first selecting it and then clicking the Start button.
You can also select multiple Containers and start them all at the same time. 

Once the Container is in the 'Running' mode, a green arrow appears next to it.
If there are any errors starting the Container(s), red icons appear next to Containers and the Execution Server that they are deployed on. 

You should check the logs of both the Execution Server and the current Business Central to see what the errors are before redeploying the Containers (and possibly the Execution Server).⁠

== Stopping and Deleting a Container


Similar to starting a Container, select the Container(s) that you want to stop (or delete) and click the Stop button (which replaces the Start button for that Container once it has entered the 'Running' mode) or the Delete button.⁠

== Updating a Container


You can update deployed `KieContainers` without restarting the Execution Server.
This is useful in cases where the Business Rules change, creating new versions of packages to be provisioned.

You can have multiple versions of the same package provisioned and deployed, each to a different ``KieContainer``. 

To update deployments in a `KieContainer` dynamically, click on the icon next to the Container.
This will open up the Container Info screen.
An example of this screen is shown here:

The Container Info screen is a useful tool because it not only allows you to see the endpoint for this ``KieContainer``, but it also allows you to either manually or automatically refresh the provision if an update is available.
The update can be manual or automatic:

*Manual Update:* To manually update a ``KieContainer``, enter the new Version number in the Version box and click on the *Update* button.
You can of course, update the Group Id or the Artifact Id , if these have changed as well.
Once updated, the Execution server updates the container and shows you the resolved GAV attributes at the bottom of the screen in the *Resolved Release Id* section. 

*Automatic Update:* If you want a deployed Container to always have the latest version of your deployment without manually editing it, you will need to set the Version property to the value of `LATEST` and start a ``Scanner``.
This will ensure that the deployed provision always contains the latest version.
The Scanner can be started just once on demand by clicking the Scan Now button or you can start it in the background with scans happening at a specified interval (in milliseconds).You can also set this value to `LATEST` when you are first creating this deployment.
The *Resolved Release
                            Id* in this case will show you the actual, latest version number.
