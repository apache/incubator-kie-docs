= Data objects

Data objects are custom data types implemented as java objects in specified packages of your project. For example, you might create a Person object with data fields Name, Address, and Date of Birth to specify personal details. You must specify these custom data types for your assets, such as for decision tables and guided rules, to determine what data your assets and your decision service are based on.
