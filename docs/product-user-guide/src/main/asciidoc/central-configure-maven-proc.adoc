= Configuring {CENTRAL} to use an external Maven repository

You can configure {CENTRAL} to use an external Maven repository instead of its built-in repository. In this case, {CENTRAL} pushes all the built KJAR files into this repository. You can progress these files through the repository as necessary to implement your integration process.

IMPORTANT: Using an external Maven repository in {CENTRAL} deployed on OpenShift is not supported.

.Procedure

. Install the {CENTRAL}. See {URL_INSTALLING_DM_ON_PREMISE}[_{INSTALLING_DM_ON_PREMISE}_] for instructions.
. Create a Maven `settings.xml` file with connetion and access details for your external repository. For details about the `settings.xml` file, see Maven documentation: https://maven.apache.org/settings.html .
. In the `<eap_home>/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml` file, under the `<system-properties>` tag, set the `kie.maven.settings.custom` property to the full pathname of the `settings.xml` file, for example:
+
[source,xml]
----
<property name="kie.maven.settings.custom" value="/opt/custom-config/settings.xml"/>
----
+
. Start or restart the {CENTRAL}.
