= Stopping and removing a service in {KIE_SERVER}

You can use an API call to stop and remove a KIE container with services on {KIE_SERVER}. You need the container (deployment unit) identifier that was configured when the container was started.

.Procedure
To stop and remove a KIE container with services on {KIE_SERVER}, run the following command to send an API request:

[subs="verbatim,macros"]
----
$ curl --user "<username>:<password>" -X DELETE http://<serverhost>:<serverport>/kie-server/services/rest/server/containers/<containerID>
----

Replace the following values:

* *<username>:* The user name of a user who can log on to {KIE_SERVER} and administer it.
* *<password>:* The password for the user who can log on to {KIE_SERVER} and administer it.
* *<containerID>:* The identifier for the KIE container (deployment unit). You can use any random identifier but it must be the same in both places in the command (the URL and the data).
* *<serverhost>:* The host name for the {KIE_SERVER}, or `localhost` if you are running the command on the same host as the {KIE_SERVER}.
* *<serverport>:* The port number for the {KIE_SERVER}.

For example:

ifdef::PAM[]
[subs="verbatim,macros"]
----
curl --user "rhpamAdmin:password@1" -X DELETE http://localhost:39043/kie-server/services/rest/server/containers/kie1
----
endif::PAM[]
ifdef::DM[]
[subs="verbatim,macros"]
----
curl --user "rhdmAdmin:password@1" -X DELETE http://localhost:39043/kie-server/services/rest/server/containers/kie1
----
endif::DM[]
