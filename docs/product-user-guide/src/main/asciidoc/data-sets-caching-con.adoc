= Caching

{CENTRAL} data set functionality provides two cache levels:

* Client level
* Back-end level

[float]
== Client cache

When this cache is turned on, the data set is cached in a web browser during the look-up operation.
Consequently, further look-up operations do not perform requests to the back end.

[float]
== Back-end cache

When this cache is turned on, the data set is cached by the {CENTRAL} engine.
Doing this reduces the number of requests to the remote storage system.

[NOTE]
====
The Java and CSV data providers rely on back-end caching.

[NOTE]
====
Back-end cache settings are not always visible in the *Advanced* tab of the *Data Set Editor*.
