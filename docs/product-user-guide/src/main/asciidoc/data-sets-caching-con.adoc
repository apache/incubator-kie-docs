= Caching

{PRODUCT}'s data set functionality provides two cache levels:

* Client level
* Back-end level

[float]
== Client Cache

When this cache is turned on, the data set is cached in a web browser during the look-up operation.
Consequently, further look-up operations do not perform any request to the back end.

[float]
== Back-end Cache

When this cache is turned on, the data set is cached by the {PRODUCT} engine.
This reduces the number of requests to the remote storage system.

[NOTE]
====
The Java and CSV data providers rely on back-end caching.
As a result, back-end cache settings are not always visible in the *Advanced*
 tab of the *Data Set Explorer*.
