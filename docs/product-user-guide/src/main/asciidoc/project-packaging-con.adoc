= Packaging a project

In {PRODUCT}, each project is packaged as a Knowledge JAR (KJAR) file and deployed to a {KIE_SERVER} that runs the service from that KJAR file. Project KJAR files are stored in a Maven repository and identified by three values: `GroupId`, `ArtifactId`, and `Version` (GAV). The `Version` value must be unique for every new version that might need to be deployed. To identify an artifact (including a KJAR file), you need all three GAV values.

Although projects are packaged automatically in {PRODUCT} as KJAR files with assigned GAV values, ensure that you validate the GAV values and set new values as needed in order to properly package your project for deployment.
