= Packaging a project

In {PRODUCT}, each project is packaged as a Knowledge JAR (KJAR) file and deployed to a {KIE_SERVER} that runs the
ifdef::DM[]
decision services and other deployable assets
endif::DM[]
ifdef::PAM[]
decision services, process applications, and other deployable assets
endif::PAM[]
(collectively referred to as _services_) from that KJAR file. These services are consumed at run time through an instantiated KIE container, or _deployment unit_. Project KJAR files are stored in a Maven repository and identified by three values: `GroupId`, `ArtifactId`, and `Version` (GAV). The `Version` value must be unique for every new version that might need to be deployed. To identify an artifact (including a KJAR file), you need all three GAV values.

Although projects are packaged automatically in {PRODUCT} as KJAR files with assigned GAV values, ensure that you validate the GAV values and set new values as needed in order to properly package your project for deployment.
