= {PRODUCT} project packaging

{PRODUCT} projects contain the business assets that you develop in {PRODUCT}. Each project in {PRODUCT} is packaged as a Knowledge JAR (KJAR) file with configuration files such as a Maven project object model file (`pom.xml`), which contains build, environment, and other information about the project, and a KIE module descriptor file (`kmodule.xml`), which contains the KIE base and KIE session configurations for the assets in the project. You deploy the packaged KJAR file to a {KIE_SERVER} that runs the
ifdef::DM[]
decision services and other deployable assets
endif::DM[]
ifdef::PAM[]
decision services, process applications, and other deployable assets
endif::PAM[]
(collectively referred to as _services_) from that KJAR file. These services are consumed at run time through an instantiated KIE container, or _deployment unit_. Project KJAR files are stored in a Maven repository and identified by three values: `GroupId`, `ArtifactId`, and `Version` (GAV). The `Version` value must be unique for every new version that might need to be deployed. To identify an artifact (including a KJAR file), you need all three GAV values.

Projects in {CENTRAL} are packaged automatically when you build and deploy the projects. For projects outside of {CENTRAL}, such as independent Maven projects or projects within a Java application, you must configure the KIE module descriptor settings in an appended `kmodule.xml` file or directly in your Java application in order to build and deploy the projects.
