== Guided Decision Trees

A decision tree is a graphical representation of a decision model in a tree-like manner. You can create simple decision trees in Business Central with flat data object models. The editor does not support nested data objects.

The editor offers a palette on the left-hand side (with available data objects, fields and corresponding actions) and a working area on the right-hand side where you can drag and drop the data objects to build a decision tree.
You can use connectors and applicable child objects prompted by the editor, to complete your tree. You can manipulate each node using its `Delete`, `Edit`, and `Collapse` icons.

While creating a decision tree, remember the following points:

* A tree must have a data object at the root.
* A tree can only have one root.
* Data objects can have other data objects, field constraints, or actions as children.
* The field constraints must be on fields of the same data object as the parent node.
* Field constraints can have either other field constraints or actions as children.
* The field constraints must be on fields of the same data object as the parent node.
* Actions can only have other actions as children.

[NOTE]
====
Guided Decision Tree is a Technology Preview feature, and therefore _not_ currently supported in Red Hat JBoss BRMS.

== Verification and Validation of Guided Decision Tables

In Business Central, the guided decision tables are a way of representing conditional logic (rule) in a precise manner, and they are well suited to business level rules.

=== Introduction

Business Central provides verification and validation feature to help ensure that a guided decision table is complete and error free.
The feature looks for gaps in the logic of a guided decision table and validates the relationship between different cells.
Most of the issues that the Business Central verification and validation feature reports are gaps in the author's logic.
The verification and validation feature does not prevent you from saving your work if you choose to ignore the verification and validation notifications.

When you edit a guided decision table, the verification and validation feature notifies you if you do something wrong.
For example, if you forget to set an action for a row of the guided decision table or if you have a duplicate row, a new panel, Analysis, will open in the Business Central with a notification about the issue.
The Analysis panel presents a list of issues found in the guided decision table, each item also pointing out the affected guided decision table rows.
If you select an item in the list of issues, you will see a more in-depth description of the problem.

The validation and verification feature helps you resolve issues around:

* Redundancy
+
Redundancy happens when two rows in a decision table execute the same consequences for the same set of facts.
For example, two rows checking a client's birthday and providing a birthday discount may result in double discount.
* Subsumption
+
Subsumption is similar to redundancy and exists when two rules execute the same consequences, but one executes on a subset of facts of the other.
For example, these two rules:

** when Person age > 10 then Increase Counter
** when Person age > 20 then Increase Counter

+
In this case, if a person is 15 years old, only one rule fires and if a person is 20 years old, both rules fire.
Such cases cause similar trouble during runtime as redundancy.
* Conflicts
+
A conflicting situation occurs when two similar conditions have different consequences.
Sometimes, there may be conflicts between two rows (rules) or two cells in a decision table.
+
The example below illustrates conflict between two rows in a decision table:

** when Deposit > 20000 then Approve Loan
** when Deposit > 20000 then Refuse Loan

+
In this case, there is no way to know if the loan will be approved or not.
+
The example below illustrates conflict between two cells in a decision table:

** When Age > 25
** When Age < 25

+
A row with conflicting cells never executes.
* Broken *Unique Hit* Policy
+
When the *Unique Hit* policy is applied to a decision table, only one row at a time can be executed and each row must be unique, with no overlap of conditions being met. If more than one row is executed, then the verification report identifies the broken hit policy. For example, consider the following conditions in a table that determines eligibility for a price discount:

** When Is Student = true
** When Is Military = true

+
If a customer is both a student and in the military, both conditions apply and break the *Unique Hit* policy. Rows in this type of table must therefore be created in a way that does not allow multiple rules to fire at one time. For details about hit policies, see <<_hit_policies_con>>.
* Defiency
+
Defiency is similar to a conflict and occurs due to incompleteness in the logic of a rule in a decision table.
For example, consider the following two deficient rules:

** when Age > 20 then Approve Loan
** when Deposit < 20000 then Refuse Loan

+
These two rules may lead to confusion for a person who is over 20 years old and has deposited less than 20000.
You may add more constraints to avoid the conflict after noticing the warning to make your rule logic complete.
* Missing Columns
+
In some cases, usually by accident, the user can delete all the condition or action columns.
When the conditions are removed, all the actions are executed and when the actions columns are missing the rows do nothing.
Both may or may not be by design, usually though this is a mistake.
* Incomplete Ranges
+
Ranges of field values are incomplete if a table contains constraints against possible field values but does not define all possible values. The verification report identifies any incomplete ranges provided. For example, if your table has a check for if an application is approved, the verification report reminds you to make sure you also handle situations where the application was not approved.


=== Reporting


The verification and validation feature of Business Central reports different issue levels in the Analysis panel while you are updating a guided decision table.

* image:gdtValidationVerificationIconError.png[] Error: This means a serious fault, which may lead to the guided decision table failing to work as designed at run time. Conflicts, for example, are reported as errors.
* image:gdtValidationVerificationIconWarning.png[] Warning: This is most likely a serious fault, however they may not prevent the guided decision table from working but need to be double checked. Warnings are used e.g. for subsumption.
* image:gdtValidationVerificationIconInfo.png[] Information: This kind of issues might be a design decision of the author of the guided decision table as well as a simple accident. This is used e.g. for a row missing any condition.


[NOTE]
====
Business Central verification and validation does not prevent you from saving an incorrect change.
The feature only reports issues while editing and you can still continue to overlook those and save your changes.
====

=== Disabling Verification and Validation of Guided Decision Tables

The decision table verification and validation feature of Business Central is enabled by default. You can disable it by setting the `org.kie.verification.disable-dtable-realtime-verification` system property value to `true`.

For example, if you are using JBoss EAP as your application server, navigate to `$EAP_HOME` directory  and run the following command:

[source]
----
./standalone.sh -Dorg.kie.verification.disable-dtable-realtime-verification=true
----

Alternatively, set this property in the `standalone.xml` file:

[source]
----
<property name="org.kie.verification.disable-dtable-realtime-verification" value="true"/>
----

Move Cell Merging and Grouping somewhere under Rule Templates

[[_cell_merging1]]
=== Cell Merging


The icon in the top left of the decision table toggles cell merging on and off.
When cells are merged, those in the same column with identical values are merged into a single cell.
This simplifies changing the value of multiple cells that shared the same original value.
When cells are merged, they also gain an icon in the top-left of the cell that allows rows spanning the merged cell to be grouped.

.Cell Merging
image::1185.png[ A table demonstrating the merging of cells.]


[[_cell_grouping1]]
=== Cell Grouping


Cells that have been merged can be further collapsed into a single row.
Clicking the [+\-] icon in the top left of a merged cell collapses the corresponding rows into a single entry.
Cells in other columns spanning the collapsed rows that have identical values are shown unchanged.
Cells in other columns spanning the collapsed rows that have different values are highlighted and the first value displayed.

.Cell Grouping
image::1186.png[ This table shows how cells can be grouped using the +\- options.]


When the value of a grouped cell is altered, all cells that have been collapsed also have their values updated.

[[_sect_rule_templates]]
== Rule Templates

[[_the_guided_rule_template]]
=== The Guided Rule Template


Rule Templates enable you to define a rule structure. They provide a place-holder for values and data, and they populate templates to generate many rules. From the user's perspective, Guided Rule Templates are parametrized guided rules that contain a data table which provides parameter values. The templates enable more flexible decision tables and can enhance the flexibility of rules in existing databases. For information about managing dependencies of Rule Templates, see the _Dependency Management for Guided Decision Tables, Scorecards, and Rule Templates_ section of the _{DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE}_.

.Procedure: Creating a new Guided Rule Template
. In the *Project Explorer* view, do one of the following:
+
.. If you are in the Project view, select the organizational unit, repository, and the project where you want to create the template.
.. If you are in the Repository view, navigate to `src/main/resources/` and the `SUBFOLDER/PACKAGE` where you want to create the project folder for the rule template.
. In the perspective menu, go to *New Item* -> *Guided Rule Template*.
. In the *Create new Guided Rule Template* dialog window, specify the rule template name:
+
.. In the *Guided Rule Template* text box, enter a name of the asset, select the package from the *Package* selector, then click *OK*.
. The new Guided Rule Template is now created and from the selected project.

[[_when_constraints_in_the_guided_rule_template]]
=== WHEN Conditions in Guided Rule Templates

The Guided Rule Template Editor in Business Central allows you to set rule templates where the data is kept separate from the rules.

Make sure you have already set a data model for your project as described in <<data_objects_create_proc>>.

.Procedure: Creating Simple Condition with Restriction and Multiple Field Constraint
. In the Guided Rule Template Editor, click the plus icon (image:5686.png[]) on the right side of the `WHEN` section.
+
The *Add a condition to the rule...* dialog window with the available condition templates opens.
+
.Add a Condition to the Rule Dialog Window
image::5687.png[]

. Choose a condition (for example *LoanApplication ...*) and click *Ok*.
+
A new condition is displayed in the Guided Rule Template Editor.

. Click on the condition.
+
The *Modify constraints for LoanApplication* dialog window opens. From here you can add a restriction on a field, apply multiple field constraints, add a new formula style expression, apply an expression editor, or set a variable name.

. Modify the condition to suit your needs. For example, set a variable name that can help define the condition, or add a restriction.
+
Once you select a restriction, the dialog window closes automatically.
+
.Modifying a Condition
image::5689.png[]

. Choose an operator for the restriction (for example `greater than`) from the drop-down menu next to the added restriction.

. Click *Edit* (image:6191.png[]) to define the field value. The field value can be a literal value, a template key, a formula, or an expression editor.

. To apply multiple field constraint, click on the condition and in the *Modify constraints for LoanApplication* dialog window, select *All of(And)* or *Any of(Or)* from the *Multiple field constraint* drop-down menu.
+
.Adding Multiple Field Constraint
image::5688.png[]
+
The constraint is displayed in the Guided Rule Template Editor.

. Click on the constraint.
+
The *Add fields to this constraint* dialog window opens.

. Specify the fields and their values. For example, by clicking *New Formula*, you can add a new formula expression that is later evaluated to be true or false.

[[_decision_tables_in_the_guided_rule_template]]
=== Data Tables in the Guided Rule Template


Data tables provide variables for guided rule templates that you define. This generates a number of rules, based on your settings. Data tables can be altered within the Guided Template Editor by clicking on the *Data* tab. Consider the following example:

A company offers phone service, internet service, and TV service. The monthly payment differs based on the active services that a customer has. The template for our example looks as follows:

image::datatablestemplate.png[]

To populate the rules:

.Procedure: Using the Guided Template Editor with Data Tables
. Click the *Data* tab to access the newly created data table. The table is empty at first, containing only a header with variables defined in the template:
+
image::emptytable.png[]

. Click *Add row...*. Each new row results in one new rule.
. Input additional data into the table. For example:
+
.Data Table for Guided Template Editor
image::populatedguidedtuletable.png[]
. To view the DRL code, click the *Source* tab.
+
[source,java]
----
rule "PaymentRules_6"
	dialect "mvel"
	when
		Customer( hasInternetService == false , hasPhoneService == false , hasTVService == true )
	then
		RecurringPayment fact0 = new RecurringPayment();
		fact0.setAmount( 5.0B );
		insertLogical( fact0 );
end

rule "PaymentRules_5"
	dialect "mvel"
	when
		Customer( hasInternetService == false , hasPhoneService == true , hasTVService == false )
	then
		RecurringPayment fact0 = new RecurringPayment();
		fact0.setAmount( 5.0B );
		insertLogical( fact0 );
end
//Other rules omitted for brevity.
----

. Click *Save* to save the template when you are finished working in the Guided Template Editor.


[#rules_dsl_con]
== The Domain Specific Language Editor


The domain specific language feature enables you to define language that is specific to your problem domain. You, or business analyst users, can then create rules using only the predefined language. This simplifies the process of rule creation for users without deep knowledge of rules and the rule language. Sentence constructed from domain specific languages (or DSL sentences) can be edited in the DSL editor. See the _{DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE}_ for more information about domain specific languages.
The DSL syntax is extended to provide hints to control how the DSL variables are rendered. The following hints are supported:

* {<varName>:<regular expression>}
+
This will render a text field in place of the DSL variable when the DSL sentence is used in the guided editor.
The content of the text field will be validated against the regular expression.
* {<varName>:ENUM:<factType.fieldName>}
+
This will render an enumeration in place of the DSL variable when the DSL sentence is used in the guided editor.
<factType.fieldName> binds the enumeration to the model fact and field enumeration definition.
This could be either a Knowledge Base enumeration or a Java enumeration, i.e., defined in a model POJO JAR file.
* {<varName>:DATE:<dateFormat>}
+
This will render a date selector in place of the DSL variable when the DSL sentence is used in the guided editor.
* {<varName>:BOOLEAN:<[checked | unchecked]>}
+
This will render a dropdown selector in place of the DSL variable, providing boolean choices, when the DSL sentence is used in the guided editor.

[[_sect_data_enumerations]]
== Data Enumerations

[[_data_enumerations_drop_down_list_configuration1]]
=== Data Enumerations Drop-Down List Configuration


Data enumerations are an optional type of asset that can be configured to provide drop-down lists for the guided decision table editor. Double-click on a cell to view the enumeration drop-down list if the cell condition is based the same fact and field as the enumeration.

image::user-guide-enumeration_gdst.png[]

They are stored and edited just like any other asset and only apply to the package they are created in.

The contents of an enumeration configuration are the mapping of a `fact.field` to a list of values.
These values are used to populate the drop-down menu.
The list can either be literal or use a utility class (which must be added to the classpath) to load the strings.
The strings contain either a value to be shown in the drop-down menu or a mapping from the code value (which is what is used in the rule) and a display value, e.g., M=Mini.

.An Example Enumeration Configuration
====
[source]
----
'Board.type' : [ 'Short', 'Long', 'M=Mini', 'Boogie']
'Person.age' : [ '20', '25', '30', '35' ]
----

This can be also be configured in Business Central as follows:

image::user-guide-data_enumeration.png[]

====


[[_advanced_enumeration_concepts1]]
=== Advanced Enumeration Concepts


Drop-down lists are dependent on field values.
With enumerations it is possible to define multiple options based on other field values.

A fact model for insurance policies could have a class called Insurance, consisting of the fields, `policyType` and ``coverage``.
The choices for `policyType` could be `Home` or ``Car``.
The type of insurance policy will determine the type of coverage that will be available.
A home insurance policy could include `property` or ``liability``.
A car insurance policy could include `collision` or ``fullCoverage``.

The field value policyType determines which options will be presented for coverage, and it is expressed as follows:

[source]
----

 'Insurance.policyType' : ['Home', 'Car']
 'Insurance.coverage[policyType=Home]' : ['property', 'liability']
 'Insurance.coverage[policyType=Car]' : ['collision', 'fullCoverage']
----

[[_obtaining_data_lists_from_external_sources]]
=== Obtaining Data Lists from External Sources


A list of Strings from an external source can be retrieved and used in an enumeration menu.
This is achieved by adding code to the classpath that returns a [class]``java.util.List`` (of strings). Instead of specifying a list of values in the user interface, the code can return the list of strings.
(As normal, you can use the "=" sign inside the strings if you want to use a different display value to the rule value.) For example, you could use the following:

[source]
----
'Person.age' : ['20','25', '30', '35']
----


To:

[source]
----
'Person.age' : (new com.yourco.DataHelper()).getListOfAges()
----


This assumes you have a class called [class]``DataHelper`` which has a method [method]``getListOfAges()`` which returns a list of strings.
The data enumerations are loaded the first time the guided editor is used in a session.
To check the enumeration has loaded, go to the package configuration screen.
You can "save and validate" the package; this will check it and provide feedback about any errors.

[[_sect_scorecards]]
== Scorecards

[[_scorecards]]
=== Scorecards


Scorecard is a Risk Management tool which is a graphical representation of a formula used to calculate an overall score.
It is mostly used by financial institutions or banks to calculate the risk they can take to sell a product in market.
Thus it can predict the likelihood or probability of a certain outcome.
{PRODUCT} now supports additive scorecards that calculates an overall score by adding all partial scores assigned to individual rule conditions.

Additionally, Drools Scorecards allows for reason codes to be set, which help in identifying the specific rules (buckets) that have contributed to the overall score.
Drools Scorecards will be based on the PMML 4.1 Standard.

In general, a scorecard can be created more or less in this way:

. A statistical analysis is performed on the historical data which is usually collected from the existing customer database.
. A predictive or probable characteristics (attributes or pieces of information) are identified based on this analysis.
. Each characteristics are then broken down into ranges of possible values which are then given a score.


To explain it in detail, following is an example:

.Scorecard Example
image::2657.png[]


[[_creating_a_scorecard]]
=== Creating a Scorecard

.Procedure: Creating a new Score Card (Spreadsheet)
. Open the *Project Authoring* perspective: on the main menu, click *Authoring* -> *Project Authoring*.
. In the *Project Explorer* view, do the following:
+
.. If in the Project view of Project Explorer, select the organizational unit, repository and the project where you want to create the score card.
.. If in the Repository view of Project Explorer, navigate to the project root, where you want to create the score card.
. In the perspective menu, go to *New Item* -> *Score Card (Spreadsheet)*.
. In the *Create new Score Card (Spreadsheet)* dialog window, define the package details:
+
.. In the *Resource Name* text box, enter the score card name.
.. Click on *Choose File* and browse to the location to select the spreadsheet in which the score card is initially created.
. Click *OK*.
. The new score card spreadsheet is created under the selected project.

When you build your own application comprising guided scorecards, ensure that you have the necessary dependencies added to your classpath. For more information about dependencies for guided decision tables, see the _Dependency Management for Guided Decision Tables, Scorecards, and Rule Templates_ section of the _{DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE}_.
