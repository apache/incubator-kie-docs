= Adding WHEN conditions in guided rules

The *WHEN* part of the rule contains the conditions that must be met to execute an action. For example, if a bank requires loan applicants to have over 21 years of age, then the *WHEN* condition of an "Underage" rule would be `Age | less than | 21`. You can set simple or complex conditions to determine how and when your rules are applied.

.Prerequisite
All data objects required for your rules have been created or imported and are listed in the *Data Objects* tab of the guided rules designer.

.Procedure
. In the guided rules designer, click the plus icon (image:5686.png[]) on the right side of the `WHEN` section.
+
The *Add a condition to the rule* window with the available condition elements opens.
+

The list includes the data objects from the *Data Objects* tab of the guided rules designer, any DSL objects defined for the package (if you selected *Show declared DSL sentences* when you created this guided rule), and the following standard options:

* *The following does not exist:* Use this to specify facts and constraints that must not exist.
* *The following exists:* Use this to specify facts and constraints that must exist. This option is triggered on only the first match, not subsequent matches.
* *Any of the following are true:* Use this to list any facts or constraints that must be true.
* *From:* Use this to define a `From` conditional element for the rule.
* *From Accumulate:* Use this to define an `Accumulate` conditional element for the rule.
* *From Collect:* Use this to define a `Collect` conditional element for the rule.
* *From Entry Point:* Use this to define an `Entry Point` for the pattern.
* *Free form DRL:* Use this to insert a free-form DRL field where you can define condition elements freely, without the guided rules designer.
+
. Choose a condition element (for example, *LoanApplication*) and click *Ok*.
. Click the condition element in the guided rules designer and use the *Modify constraints for LoanApplication* window to add a restriction on a field, apply multiple field constraints, add a new formula style expression, apply an expression editor, or set a variable name.

[NOTE]
====
A variable name enables you to identify a fact or field in other constructs within the guided rule. For example, you could set the variable of `LoanApplication` to `a` and then reference `a` in a separate `Bankruptcy` constraint that specifies which application the bankruptcy is based on.

[source,java]
----
a : LoanApplication()
Bankruptcy(application == a ).

After you select a constraint, the window closes automatically.
. Choose an operator for the restriction (for example, `greater than`) from the drop-down menu next to the added restriction.
. Click the edit icon (image:6191.png[]) to define the field value. The field value can be a literal value, a formula, or a full MVEL expression.
. To apply multiple field constraints, click the condition and in the *Modify constraints for LoanApplication* window, select *All of(And)* or *Any of(Or)* from the *Multiple field constraint* drop-down menu.
+

. Click the constraint in the guided rules designer and further define the field value.
. After you define all condition components of the rule, click *Validate* in the upper-right toolbar of the guided rules designer to validate the guided rule conditions. If the rule validation fails, address any problems described in the error message, review all components in the rule, and try again to validate the rule until the rule passes.
. Click *Save* in the guided rules designer to save your work.
