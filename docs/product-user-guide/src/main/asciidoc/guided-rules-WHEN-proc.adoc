= Adding WHEN Conditions in Guided Rules

The *WHEN* part of the rule is the condition that must be met to execute an action. For example, if a bank requires loan applicants to have over 21 years of age, then the *WHEN* condition would be `Age | greater than | 21`. You can set simple or complex conditions to determine how and when your rules are applied.

.Prerequisite
All data objects required for your rules are listed in the *Data Objects* tab of the Guided Rule Editor. See <<guided_rules_create_proc>> for details.

.Procedure
. In the Guided Rule Editor, click the plus icon (image:5686.png[]) on the right side of the `WHEN` section.
+
The *Add a condition to the rule...* dialog window with the available condition templates opens.

. Choose a condition (for example *LoanApplication ...*) and click *Ok*.
+
A new condition is displayed in the Guided Rule Editor.

. Click the condition.
+
The *Modify constraints for LoanApplication* dialog window opens. From here you can add a restriction on a field, apply multiple field constraints, add a new formula style expression, apply an expression editor, or set a variable name.

. Modify the condition to suit your needs. For example, set a variable name that can help define the condition, or add a restriction.
+
Once you select a restriction, the dialog window closes automatically.

. Choose an operator for the restriction (for example `greater than`) from the drop-down menu next to the added restriction.

. Click *Edit* (image:6191.png[]) to define the field value. The field value can be a literal value, a template key, a formula, or an expression editor.

. To apply multiple field constraint, click the condition and in the *Modify constraints for LoanApplication* dialog window, select *All of(And)* or *Any of(Or)* from the *Multiple field constraint* drop-down menu.
