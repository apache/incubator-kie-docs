= Adding WHEN conditions in guided rules

The *WHEN* part of the rule is the condition that must be met to execute an action. For example, if a bank requires loan applicants to have over 21 years of age, then the *WHEN* condition would be `Age | greater than | 21`. You can set simple or complex conditions to determine how and when your rules are applied.

.Prerequisite
All data objects required for your rules are listed in the *Data Objects* tab of the guided rule designer. See xref:guided-rules-create-proc[] for details.

.Procedure
. In the guided rule designer, click the plus icon (image:5686.png[]) on the right side of the `WHEN` section.
+
The *Add a condition to the rule* window with the available condition elements opens.
+

+
The list includes the data objects from the *Data Objects* tab of the guided rule designer, any DSL objects defined for the package (if you selected *Use Domain Specific Language (DSL)* when you created this guided rule), and the following standard options:

* *The following does not exist:* Use this to specify facts and constraints that must not exist.
* *The following exists:* Use this to specify facts and constraints that must exist. This option is triggered on only the first match, not subsequent matches.
* *Any of the following are true:* Use this to list facts and constraints that must be true.
* *From:* Use this to define a `From` conditional element for the rule.
* *From Accumulate:* Use this to define an `Accumulate` conditional element for the rule.
* *From Collect:* Use this to define a `Collect` conditional element for the rule.
* *From Entry Point:* Use this to define an `Entry Point` for the pattern.
* *Free form DRL:* Use this to insert a free-form DRL field where you can define condition elements freely, without the guided rule designer.

*<@Michael (1 of 6): I was going to put a note here about template keys, but they don't apply to free form DRL within the guided rule designer, right? Or do they? Since I don't see any option in the guided editor either for template keys, when I modify values, I assume it's safe to say that template keys just don't apply to guided rules, only to guided decision tables, guide rule templates, and decision tables, where you can define the values to be interpolated with the keys. Maybe DRL rules too, but I'm not there yet. That right?>*

.Template keys in free form DRL
[NOTE]
====
With free form DRL, you have the flexibility to add custom data types, such as template keys. Template keys are placeholder variables in your field constraints that are interpolated with a specified value when the DRL rules are generated. You can add a template key value to facts in the format `@key`. For example, `Person( age > @{age} )` creates an `$age` column in the decision table.

. Choose a condition element (for example, *LoanApplication*) and click *Ok*.
. Click the condition element in the guided rule designer and use the *Modify constraints for LoanApplication* window to add a restriction on a field, apply multiple field constraints, add a new formula style expression, apply an expression editor, or set a variable name.
. Modify the condition to suit your needs. For example, you can set a variable name to help define the condition, or you can add a restriction.

Once you select a restriction, the window closes automatically.
. Choose an operator for the restriction (for example, `greater than`) from the drop-down menu next to the added restriction.
. Click the edit icon (image:6191.png[]) to define the field value. The field value can be a literal value, a formula, or a full MVEL expression.
. To apply multiple field constraints, click the condition and in the *Modify constraints for LoanApplication* window, select *All of(And)* or *Any of(Or)* from the *Multiple field constraint* drop-down menu.
+

. Click the constraint in the guided rule designer and further define the field value.
. After you define all condition elements, click *Save* in the guided rule designer to save your work.
