= Cloning a Repository in {CENTRAL}

After you have created an organizational unit, you can clone an existing repository and associate it with that organization in the {CENTRAL} user interface.

.Prerequisites
* You have `admin` role permissions for {CENTRAL}, as described in the {URL_INSTALLATION_GUIDE}#users_create_proc[_{INSTALLATION_GUIDE}_].
* An organizational unit for this repository has been created.
* A repository has been created and is accessible for cloning.

.Procedure
. In {CENTRAL}, go to *Project Authoring* -> *Administration*.
. On the page menu, choose *Repositories* -> *Clone repository*.
+
The *Clone Repository*
pop-up window is displayed.
+
.*Clone Repository*Dialog Window

. In the *Clone Repository* dialog window, enter the repository details:
+
.. Enter the *Repository Name* to be used as the repository identifier in the Asset repository and select the *Organizational Unit* it should be added to.
.. Enter the URL of the Git repository:
* for a local repository, use ``file:///_PATH_TO_REPOSITORY_/_REPOSITORY_NAME_``;
+
[NOTE]
====
The file protocol is only supported for READ operations.
WRITE operations are _not_ supported.
====
* for a remote or preexisting repository, use `https://github.com/_USERNAME_/_REPOSITORY_NAME_.git` or ``git://_HOST_NAME_/_REPOSITORY_NAME_``.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
It is important to use the HTTPS or Git protocol instead of a SCP-style SSH URL.
{CENTRAL} does not support the basic SSH URL and fails with __Invalid URL format__.
====
.. If applicable, enter the *User Name* and *Password* of your Git account to be used for authentication.
. Click *Clone*.
+
A confirmation prompt with the notification that the repository was created successfully is displayed.
. Click *Ok*.
+
The repository is now being indexed.
Some workbench features may be unavailable until the indexing has completed.

You can view the cloned repository either in the *File Explorer* or the *Project Explorer*.
