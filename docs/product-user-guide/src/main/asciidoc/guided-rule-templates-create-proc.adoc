= Creating Guided Rule Templates

You can create guided rule templates to define rule structure and data that can be used for other rules, instead of defining many different rule structures individually.

.Procedure
. Go to *Menu* -> *Design* -> *Projects* and click the project name.
. Click *Create New Asset* -> *Guided Rule Template*.
. Enter an informative *Guided Rule Template* name and select the appropriate *Package*.
+
The new Guided Rule Template is now created under the selected project.

. Click the *Data Objects* tab and confirm that all data objects required for your rules are listed. If not, click *New item* to import objects from other packages, or **create new data objects(expand content from data-objects-create-proc.adoc) within the package.
. After all data objects are in place, return to the *Editor* tab and use the buttons on the right of the editor window to add and define the *WHEN* (condition) and *THEN* (action) sections of the rule, based on the available data objects.
+
For details about adding conditions and actions, see <<guided_rules_WHEN_proc>> and <<guided_rules_THEN_proc>>.
