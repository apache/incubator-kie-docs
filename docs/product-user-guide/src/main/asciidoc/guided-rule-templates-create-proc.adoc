= Creating guided rule templates

You can use guided rule templates to define rule structures with placeholder values (template keys) that correspond to actual values defined in a data table. Guided rule templates are an efficient alternative to defining sets of many guided rules individually that use the same structure.

.Procedure
. Go to *Menu* -> *Design* -> *Projects* and click the project name.
. Click *Add Asset* -> *Guided Rule Template*.
. Enter an informative *Guided Rule Template* name and select the appropriate *Package*. The package that you specify must be the same package where the required data objects have been assigned or will be assigned.
. Click *Ok* to create the rule template.
+
The new guided rule template is now listed in the *Guided Rule Templates* panel of the *Project Explorer*.
+
. Click the *Data Objects* tab and confirm that all data objects required for your rules are listed. If not, click *New item* to import data objects from other packages, or
ifeval::["{context}" == "guided-rule-templates"]
xref:data-objects-create-proc_guided-rule-templates[create data objects]
endif::[]
ifeval::["{context}" == "chap-writing-rules"]
xref:data-objects-create-proc_chap-data-models[create data objects]
endif::[]
within your package.
. After all data objects are in place, return to the *Model* tab and use the buttons on the right side of the window to add and define the *WHEN* (condition) and *THEN* (action) sections of the rule template, based on the available data objects. For the field values that vary per rule, use template keys in the format `$key` in the rule designer or in the format `@{key}` in free form DRL (if used).

.Note on template keys
[NOTE]
====
Template keys are fundamental in guided rule templates. Template keys are what enable field values in the templates to be interchanged with actual values that you define in the corresponding data table to generate different rules from the same template. You can use other value types, such as *Literal* or *Formula*, for values that are part of the rule structure of all rules based on that template. However, for any values that differ among the rules, use the *Template key* field type with a specified key. Without template keys in a guided rule template, the corresponding data table is not generated in the template designer and the template essentially functions as an individual guided rule.
====
+
The *WHEN* part of the rule template is the condition that must be met to execute an action. For example, if a telecommunications company charges customers based on the services they subscribe to (Internet, phone, and TV), then one of the *WHEN* conditions would be `internetService | equal to | $hasInternetService`. The template key `$hasInternetService` is interchanged with an actual Boolean value (`true` or `false`) defined in the data table for the template.
+
The *THEN* part of the rule template is the action to be performed when the conditional part of the rule has been met. For example, if a customer subscribes to only Internet service, a *THEN* action for `RecurringPayment` with a template key `$amount` would set the actual monthly amount to the integer value defined for Internet service charges in the data table.
+
. After you define all components of the rule, click *Save* in the guided rule templates designer to save your work.
