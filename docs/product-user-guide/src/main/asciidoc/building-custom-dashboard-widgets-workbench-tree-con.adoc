= Navigation tree

The *Workbench* navigation tree contains the entries that are displayed in the workbench's mega menu. Changes to this navigation tree structure will be reflected in the mega menu. Such mechanism can be used, for example, to publish new pages.

Also, additional navigation trees can be created. These custom trees can be used during a page edition to configure the navigation components within the page. You cannot delete the *Workbench* tree from the *Navigation* tab but you can edit the *Workbench* tree hierarchy to suit your requirements. This feature helps users customize the workbench with new pages.

[NOTE]
====
The *Workbench* tree, which appears by default in the *Navigation* tab, is the mega *Menu* tree hierarchy of {PRODUCT}.
