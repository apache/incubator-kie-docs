= Workbench Tree
The workbench is the web-based application that combines all the web-based tools of {PRODUCT} into one configurable solution. It covers the complete life cycle of {PRODUCT} project beginning at the authoring phase, then on to the implementation and execution phase, and finally ends at the monitoring phase.

Workbench tree is the navigation tree hierarchy that is displayed in the *Navigation* tab on the left of the *Page Editor* tool. By default, the *Workbench* tree always appears in the *Navigation* tab. You cannot delete the *Workbench* tree from the *Navigation* tab but you can edit the tree hierarchy as per your requirements. You can add new user created groups as well as delete the existing ones from the *Workbench* tree. Any change to it will cause the mega menu to modify its entries. This feature helps users to extend the workbench with new pages.

You can create and/or delete custom navigation trees in addition to the default one from the *Navigation* tab of the *Page Editor* tool.

[NOTE]
====
The *Workbench* tree which appears by default in the *Navigation* tab, is the mega *Menu* tree hierarchy of {Product}.
