= Defining data tables for guided rule templates

After you create a guided rule template and add template keys for field values, a data table is displayed in the *Data* table of the guided rule designer. Each column in the data table corresponds to a template key that you added in the guided rule template. Use this table to define values for each template key row by row. Each row of values that you define in the data table for that template results in a rule.

.Procedure
. In the guided rule template designer, click the *Data* tab to view the data table. Each column in the data table corresponds to a template key that you added in the guided rule template.
+
NOTE: If you did not add any template keys to the rule template, then this data table does not appear and the template does not function as a genuine template but essentially as an individual guided rule. For this reason, template keys are fundamental in creating guided rule templates.
+

. Click *Add row* and define the data values for each template key column to generate that rule (row).
. Continue adding rows and defining data values for each rule that will be generated. You can click *Add row* for each new row, or click the plus icon (image:5686.png[]) or minus icon to add or remove rows.

To view the DRL code, click the *Source* tab in the guided rule template designer.

Example:

[source,java]
----
rule "PaymentRules_6"
	dialect "mvel"
	when
		Customer( internetService == false , phoneService == false , TVService == true )
	then
		RecurringPayment fact0 = new RecurringPayment();
		fact0.setAmount( 5 );
		insertLogical( fact0 );
end

rule "PaymentRules_5"
	dialect "mvel"
	when
		Customer( internetService == false , phoneService == true , TVService == false )
	then
		RecurringPayment fact0 = new RecurringPayment();
		fact0.setAmount( 5 );
		insertLogical( fact0 );
end
...
//Other rules omitted for brevity.

. As a visual aid, click the grid icon in the upper-left corner of the data table to toggle cell merging on and off, if needed. Cells in the same column with identical values are merged into a single cell.

You can then use the expand/collapse icon [+/-] in the upper-left corner of each newly merged cell to collapse the rows corresponding to the merged cell, or to re-expand the collapsed rows.

. After you define the template key data for all rules and adjust the table display as needed, click *Validate* in the upper-right toolbar of the guided rule template designer to validate the guided rule template. If the rule template validation fails, address any problems described in the error message, review all components in the rule template and data defined in the data table, and try again to validate the rule template until the rule template passes.
. Click *Save* in the guided rule template designer to save your work.
