= Adding THEN actions in guided rule templates

The *THEN* part of the rule is the action to be performed when the conditional part of the rule has been met. For example, if a customer subscribes to only Internet service, a *THEN* action for `RecurringPayment` with a template key `$amount` would set the actual amount to the integer value defined for Internet service charges in the data table.

.Prerequisite
All data objects required for your rules are listed in the *Data Objects* tab of the guided rule template designer. See xref:guided-rules-create-proc[] for details.

.Procedure
. In the guided rule template designer, click the plus icon (image:5686.png[]) on the right side of the `THEN` section.
+
The *Add a new action* window with the available action elements opens.
+
.Add a new action to the rule

+
The list includes insertion and modification options based on the data objects in the *Data Objects* tab of the guided rule designer, and on any DSL objects defined for the package (if you selected *Use Domain Specific Language (DSL)* when you created this guided rule):

* *Insert fact:* Use this to insert a fact and define resulting fields and values for the fact.
* *Logically Insert fact:* Use this to insert a fact logically into the inference engine and define resulting fields and values for the fact. The Red Hat Decision Manager inference engine is responsible for logical decisions on insertions and retractions of facts. After regular or stated insertions, facts have to be retracted explicitly. After logical insertions, facts are automatically retracted when the conditions that originally asserted the facts are no longer true.
* *Add free form DRL:* Use this to insert a free-form DRL field where you can define condition elements freely, without the guided rule designer. For template keys in free form DRL, use the format `@key`.
+
. Choose an action element (for example, *Logically Insert fact RecurringPayment*) and click *Ok*.
. Click the action element in the guided rule template designer and use the *Add a field* window to select a field.
+
.Add a field

+
Once you select a field, the window closes automatically.
. Click the edit icon (image:6191.png[]) to define the field value.
. Select *Template key* and add a template key in the format `$key` if this value varies among the rules based on this template. This allows the field value to be interchanged with actual values that you define in the corresponding data table to generate different rules from the same template. For field values that do not vary among the rules and are part of the rule template, you can use any other value type.
. After you define all action elements, click *Save* in the guided rule template designer to save your work.
