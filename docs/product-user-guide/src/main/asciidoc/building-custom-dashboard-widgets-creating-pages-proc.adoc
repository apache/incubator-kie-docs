= Creating Pages

Using the Page Authoring tool, you can create a page which will consist of different components as per your requirements. After a page has been created and all the components in it defined, you can use the *Page Authoring* tool to save, delete, rename or copy pages as needed.

The following procedure creates a blank page only and you will have to add the page components as required manually next.
