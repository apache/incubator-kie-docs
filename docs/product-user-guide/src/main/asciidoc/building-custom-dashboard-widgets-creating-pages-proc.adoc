= Creating pages

You can create a page which will consist of different components by using the *Page Editor* tool. After a page has been created and all the components in it defined, use the *Page Editor* to save, delete, rename or copy pages as needed.

The following procedure creates a blank page only and you will have to manually add the required components subsequently.

.Procedure
. Go to *Menu* -> *Design* -> *Pages*.
. In the left pane, from the *Pages* tab, click *New*.
  Alternatively, click on *New Page* from the *Page Editor* pane.
. In the *New Page* dialog box, enter a value in the *Name* field and select the required *Style*.
. Click *Ok* and then *Save* to save the page.
