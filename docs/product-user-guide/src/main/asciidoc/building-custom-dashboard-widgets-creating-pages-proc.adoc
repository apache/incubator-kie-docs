= Creating Pages

Using the KIE Workbench, you can create a page which will contain core, navigational, and reporting components as per your requirements. After a page has been created and all the components in it defined, you can use the *Page Editor* tool of the *Dashbuilder* to save, delete, rename or copy pages as needed.

The following procedure creates a blank page only and you will have to add the core, navigational, and reporting components as required manually.

.Procedure
. Go to *Menu* -> *Design* -> *Pages*.
. In the left pane, from the *Pages* tab, click *New*.
  Alternatively, click on *New Page* from the *Content Manager* pane.
. In the *New Page...* dialog box, enter a value in the *Name* field and select the required *Style*. Click *Ok*.
