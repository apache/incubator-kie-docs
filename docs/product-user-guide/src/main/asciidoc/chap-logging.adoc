= Logging


Logs with execution information are created based on events generated by the process engine during execution. It is the engine providing a generic mechanism listening to events.
Information about the caught event can be extracted from these logs and then persisted in a data storage. To restrain the logged information, the log filtering mechanism is provided (for further information, see the _{ADMIN_GUIDE}_).
