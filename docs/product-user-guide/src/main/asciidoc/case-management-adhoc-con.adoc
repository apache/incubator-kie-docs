= Ad Hoc Tasks

Ad hoc tasks are defined but not mandatory in case management. They can be added dynamically and created during runtime to address specific needs that arise during the case. Dynamic tasks (ad hoc tasks) do not have to be present in case definition, as they can be added to the case instance at any point in time.

* Dynamic tasks can be:
** User activities
** Service activities

* Dynamic processes are any process from a case project.

Nodes with no incoming connections can be configured as `Adhoc autostart`, which is a property of the node itself. These tasks are triggered automatically when the case instance is started.
