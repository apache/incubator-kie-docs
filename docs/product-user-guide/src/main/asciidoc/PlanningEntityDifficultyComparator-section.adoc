= Planning Entity Difficulty Comparator
:imagesdir: ../..

Specified on Planning entity level, the Difficulty comparator provides a way to determine which Planning entities are more difficult to plan.
This helps optimization algorhitms to work in an efficient manner.
Refer to https://docs.jboss.org/optaplanner/release/latest/optaplanner-docs/html_single/index.html#planningEntityDifficulty[OptaPlanner documentation] for more details.

The Difficulty comparator definition tool is present in the Planner dock of the Data modeler and becomes available once a *PlanningEntity* selection is performed on a data object.

Click *Add condition* to add new sorting criteria for given planning entity.
Once the criterion is added, Clicking *Add field* allows the user to select fields which will be used for difficulty comparison.

There are 2 types of fields:

* *Basic* - value types (e.g. number, String)
* *Data object* - complex types having nested attributes

Data object types allow nesting deep into object hierarchy, until a basic type is encountered. In this situation *Add field* button is no longer displayed.
Sorting criteria are ordered. The ones defined first are prioritized when Planner engine resolves planning entity difficulty.

Click on the *Remove* icon within a label to remove the field from the sorting criteria. If the field is of type Data object, all its children are removed as well.

Click *Arrow up*, *Arrow down* to change the priority of the criterion by moving it up/down.

Select *Sort order* icon to define whether given criterion should be applied to sort the planning entities in ascending or descending order.
