= DRL rules

DRL rules are business rules that you define directly in `.drl` text files. These DRL files are the source in which all other rule assets in {CENTRAL} are ultimately rendered. You can create and manage DRL files within the {CENTRAL} interface, or externally using Red Hat Developer Studio, custom Java objects, or Maven archetypes. A DRL file can contain one or more rules that define at minimum the rule conditions (WHEN) and actions (THEN). The DRL designer in {CENTRAL} provides syntax highlighting for Java, DRL, and XML in DRL files.

All data objects related to a DRL rule must be in the same project package as the DRL rule in {CENTRAL}. Assets in the same package are imported by default. Existing assets in other packages can be imported with the DRL rule.
