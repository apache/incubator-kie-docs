These DRL files are the source in which all other rule designers in {CENTRAL} are ultimately rendered

Drools Rule Language (DRL) rules are stored as text and can be managed in the {PRODUCT} user interface. A DRL file can contain one or more rules. The condition and the action of the rule are the WHEN and THEN parts of the rule.

Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio provides tools for creating, editing, and debugging DRL files, and it should be used for these purposes.
However, DRL rules can be managed within the {PRODUCT} user interface. The Guided Rule Editor provides syntax highlighting for Java, DRL, and XML.

.Example DRL Rule
[source,java]
----
rule "approval"
salience 100 // This can short-circuit any processing.
when
a : Approve()
p : Policy()
then
p.setApproved(true);
System.out.println("APPROVED:" + a.getReason());
end
----

Rules can also be written in a defined domain-specific language (DSL). For details, see <<rules_dsl_con>>.
