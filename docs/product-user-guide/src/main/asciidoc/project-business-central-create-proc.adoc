= Creating a Project in Business Central

After you have created your organizational unit and its associated repository, you can begin creating projects of business rules and other assets in the Business Central user interface.

.Prerequisites
* You have `admin` role permissions for Business Central, as described in the {URL_INSTALLATION_GUIDE}#users_create_proc[_{INSTALLATION_GUIDE}_].
* An organizational unit for this project has been created.
* A repository for this project has been created.

[NOTE]
====
The organizational unit and repository can also be created in the process of creating your first project, but creating them in advance is recommended.
====

.Procedure
. In Business Central, go to *Authoring* -> *Project Authoring*.
. In the *Project Explorer*, select the organizational unit and the repository in which you want to create the project.
. On the perspective menu, click *New Item* -> *Project*.

The *New Project*
dialog window opens.

. Define the *Project General Settings* and *Group artifact version* details of the new project. These parameters are stored in the `pom.xml` Maven configuration file.
+
See the detailed description of the parameters:

* *Project Name*: name of the project (for example ``MortgageProject``).
* *Project Description*: description of the project, which may be useful for the project documentation purposes.
* *Group ID*: group ID of the project (for example ``org.mycompany.commons``).
* *Artifact ID*: artifact ID unique in the group (for example ``myframework``). Avoid using a space or any other special character that might lead to an invalid name.
* *Version*: version of the project (for example ``2.1.1``).
. Click *Finish*.
+
The project screen view is updated with the new project details as defined in the `pom.xml` file.
You can switch between project descriptor files and edit their content by clicking the *Project Settings: Project General Settings* button at the top of the project screen view.
