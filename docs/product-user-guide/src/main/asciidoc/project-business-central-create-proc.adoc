= Creating a Project

Projects are containers for asset packages that are housed in the repository within your defined team in Business Central. Projects define the properties of the KIE Base and KIE Session that are applied to their content. After you have created your team you can begin creating projects containing business rules and other assets.

.Prerequisites
* You have `admin` role permissions for Business Central, as described in the {URL_INSTALLATION_GUIDE}#users_create_proc[_{INSTALLATION_GUIDE}_].
* A team for this project has been created.

[NOTE]
====
The team can also be created during the process of creating your first project, but creating it in advance is recommended.
