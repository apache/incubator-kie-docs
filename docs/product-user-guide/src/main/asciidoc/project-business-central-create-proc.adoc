See the detailed description of the parameters:

* *Project Name*: name of the project (for example ``MortgageProject``).
* *Project Description*: description of the project, which may be useful for the project documentation purposes.
* *Group ID*: group ID of the project (for example ``org.mycompany.commons``).
* *Artifact ID*: artifact ID unique in the group (for example ``myframework``). Avoid using a space or any other special character that might lead to an invalid name.
* *Version*: version of the project (for example ``2.1.1``).
. Click *Finish*.

The project screen view is updated with the new project details as defined in the `pom.xml` file.
You can switch between project descriptor files and edit their content by clicking the *Project Settings: Project General Settings* button at the top of the project screen view.
