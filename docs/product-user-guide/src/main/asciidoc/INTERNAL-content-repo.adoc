This is an INTERNAL FILE ONLY containing segments of the BRMS/BPMS/DM/BA User Guides that have been removed or repurposed during the modularization effort. Some substantial restructuring of books was needed to accommodate both modular content and a more user-centric approach to doc (versus product-centric). This is therefore a temporary content repository for future reference, and can one day be deleted once confirmed to be obsolete. -Stetson

[id='_the_project_editor']
=== The Project Editor


The Project Editor helps a user to build and deploy projects.
This view provides access to the various properties of a Red Hat JBoss BRMS Project that can be edited through the Web interface.
Properties like Group artifact version, Dependencies, Metadata, Knowledge Base Settings and Imports can be managed from this view.
The editor shows the configuration options for the current active project and the content changes when you move around in your code repository.

To access the Project Editor:

. Click *Authoring* -> *Project Authoring*.
. Select your project.
. Click *Open Project Editor*.

[id='_project_settings']
=== Project Settings

.Project General Settings
The Project settings screen allows a user to set the Group, Artifact, and Version ID's for a project.
It edits the `pom.xml`
 setting file since we use Maven to build our projects.

.Dependencies
The Dependencies option allows you to set the dependencies for the current project.You access the dependencies by using *Project Settings* -> *Dependencies* option.
You can add dependencies from the Artifact repository by clicking the *Add from repository* button or by entering the Group ID, Artifact ID and Version ID of a project directly by clicking on the *Add* button.

.Project Editor - Project Dependencies
image::5906.png[]


.Metadata
The Metadata screen displays various data and version history of a project.
It enables you to edit metadata details, add descriptions, and participate in discussions which are specific to a selected asset.
You can add metadata to a project, a knowledge base (kmodule) and project imports. Each metadata tab provides the following fields:

* `Tags`: A tagging system for grouping the assets.
* `Note`: A comment from the last asset update.
* `URI`: A unique identifier of the asset inside of the Git repository.
* `Subject`, `Type`, `External link`, `Source`: Miscellaneous asset meta data.
* `Lock status` - Lock status of an asset.

.Knowledge Base Settings - Metadata
image::5799.png[A screenshot of the BRMS Project Editor - Metadata Screen]

[id='_knowledge_base_settings']
=== Knowledge Base Settings

.Knowledge Bases and Sessions
The Knowledge Base Settings allows the user to create the KIE bases and sessions using the `kmodule.xml`
 project descriptor file of your project.
Accordingly, it edits the `kmodule.xml`
 project setting file.


The Knowledge bases and sessions page lists all the knowledge bases by name.
It contains the Add, Rename, Delete, and Make Default options above the list.
Only one knowledge base can be set as default at a time.

.Project Editor - Knowledge Base Settings
image::5791.png[A screenshot of the BRMS Project Editor - Knowledge Base and Session Settings Screen]


The *Included Knowledge Bases*
 section displays the models, rules, and any other content in the included knowledge base.
It will only be visible and usable by selecting the knowledge base from the Knowledge Base list to the left.
You can Add and Delete content from this list.

The *Packages* section allows users to Add and Delete packages which are specified to the knowledge base.

The *Equals Behavior* section allows the user to choose between `Identity` or `Equality` assertion modes.

* `Identity` uses an `IdentityHashMap` to store all asserted objects.
* `Equality` uses a `HashMap` to store all asserted objects.


[NOTE]
====
See the attributes part in the {URL_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE}#kiebase[KIE Base] section of the {DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE} for further details about `Identity` and `Equality` assertion modes.
====


The *Event Processing Mode*
 section allows the user to choose between `Cloud` and `Stream` processing modes.

* `Cloud` processing mode is the default processing mode. It behaves in the same manner as any pure forward-chaining rules engine.
* `Stream` processing mode is ideal when the application needs to process streams of events.


[NOTE]
====
See the attributes part in the {URL_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE}#kiebase[KIE Base] section of the {DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE} for further details about `Cloud` and `Stream` processing modes.
====


The *Knowledge Sessions* table lists all the knowledge sessions in the selected knowledge base.
By clicking the image:5798.png[Add Icon] button, you are able to add a new knowledge session to the table.

* The `Name` field displays the name of the session.
* The `Default` option can only be allocated to one of each type of session.
* The `State` drop-down allows either Stateless or Stateful types.
* The `Clock` drop-down allows either Realtime or Pseudo choices.
* Clicking the image:5691.png[Pencil Icon] opens a pop-up that displays more properties for the knowledge session.


.Metadata
See <<_project_settings>> for more information about metadata.

[id='_imports1']
=== Imports

.External Data Objects
The External Data Objects specify a set of imports, or external data objects, used in the project.
Each asset in a project has its own imports.
The imports are used as suggestions when using the guided editors the workbench offers; accordingly, this makes it easier to work with the workbench as there is no need to type each import in every file that uses it.
By changing the Import settings, the `project.imports`
 setting files are edited.
Data Objects are usually provided by the Java runtime.
For example [class]``java.util.List``.

.Project Editor - Imports
image::5792.png[A screenshot of the BRMS Project Editor - Imports Screen]


To add a fact model to the imports section, click *New Item*. This displays a pop-up dialog to *Add Import* information.Once the Import Type has been entered, click *OK*.

To remove a fact model from the imports section, click *Remove*.

[NOTE]
====
The imports listed in the import suggestions are not automatically added into the knowledge base or into the packages of the workbench.
Each import needs to be added into each file.
====

.Metadata
See <<_project_settings>> for more information about Metadata.

[id='_repos']
=== Repositories
.Validation
The *Validation* section enables you to select which maven repositories are used to check the uniqueness of your project's GAV (group ID, artifact ID, and version).

.Project Editor - Validation
image::5793.png[A screenshot of the BRMS Project Editor - Validation Screen]

=== Persistence

.Persistence descriptor
The *Persistence descriptor* section enables you to modify *persistence.xml* through GUI. You can:

* Define a persistence unit provider.
* Define a data source.
* Change predefined properties for your persistence unit.
* Add new properties to your persistence unit.
* Manage persistable data objects.
+
The persistable data objects are based on the JPA specification and all the underlying metadata are automatically generated.

Alternatively, click *Source* tab to edit the *persistence.xml* directly.

[From chap-writing-rules]

// Removed Decision Trees and Scorecards section per BPMSPL-756 (these two features not supported in product)

== Guided Decision Trees

A decision tree is a graphical representation of a decision model in a tree-like manner. You can create simple decision trees in {CENTRAL} with flat data object models. The editor does not support nested data objects.

The editor offers a palette on the left-hand side (with available data objects, fields and corresponding actions) and a working area on the right-hand side where you can drag and drop the data objects to build a decision tree.
You can use connectors and applicable child objects prompted by the editor, to complete your tree. You can manipulate each node using its `Delete`, `Edit`, and `Collapse` icons.

While creating a decision tree, remember the following points:

* A tree must have a data object at the root.
* A tree can only have one root.
* Data objects can have other data objects, field constraints, or actions as children.
* The field constraints must be on fields of the same data object as the parent node.
* Field constraints can have either other field constraints or actions as children.
* The field constraints must be on fields of the same data object as the parent node.
* Actions can only have other actions as children.

[NOTE]
====
Guided Decision Tree is a Technology Preview feature, and therefore _not_ currently supported in Red Hat JBoss BRMS.

[id='_sect_scorecards']
== Scorecards

[id='_scorecards']
=== Scorecards


Scorecard is a Risk Management tool which is a graphical representation of a formula used to calculate an overall score.
It is mostly used by financial institutions or banks to calculate the risk they can take to sell a product in market.
Thus it can predict the likelihood or probability of a certain outcome.
{PRODUCT} now supports additive scorecards that calculates an overall score by adding all partial scores assigned to individual rule conditions.

Additionally, Drools Scorecards allows for reason codes to be set, which help in identifying the specific rules (buckets) that have contributed to the overall score.
Drools Scorecards will be based on the PMML 4.1 Standard.

In general, a scorecard can be created more or less in this way:

. A statistical analysis is performed on the historical data which is usually collected from the existing customer database.
. A predictive or probable characteristics (attributes or pieces of information) are identified based on this analysis.
. Each characteristics are then broken down into ranges of possible values which are then given a score.


To explain it in detail, following is an example:

.Scorecard Example
image::2657.png[]


[id='_creating_a_scorecard']
=== Creating a Scorecard

.Procedure: Creating a new Score Card (Spreadsheet)
. Open the *Project Authoring* page: on the main menu, click *Authoring* -> *Project Authoring*.
. In the *Project Explorer* view, do the following:
+
.. If in the Project view of Project Explorer, select the organizational unit, repository and the project where you want to create the score card.
.. If in the Repository view of Project Explorer, navigate to the project root, where you want to create the score card.
. In the page menu, go to *New Item* -> *Score Card (Spreadsheet)*.
. In the *Create new Score Card (Spreadsheet)* dialog window, define the package details:
+
.. In the *Resource Name* text box, enter the score card name.
.. Click on *Choose File* and browse to the location to select the spreadsheet in which the score card is initially created.
. Click *OK*.
. The new score card spreadsheet is created under the selected project.

When you build your own application comprising guided scorecards, ensure that you have the necessary dependencies added to your classpath. For more information about dependencies for guided decision tables, see the _Dependency Management for Guided Decision Tables, Scorecards, and Rule Templates_ section of the _{DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE}_.

=== Editing Rules Using the Asset Editor


The asset editor provides access to information about assets and gives users the ability to edit assets.

The editor contains *Editor*, *Overview*, *Source*, and *Data Objects* tabs.

.Editor Tab
The *Editor* tab is where assets can be edited.
The available options in the edit tab will depend on the type of asset being edited.

.The Guided Decision Table - Editor Tab
image::3281.png[A screen shot of the asset editor - edit tab]

.Overview Tab
The Overview screen displays the generic data and version history of an asset.
It allows a user to edit other metadata details, add descriptions and discussions which are specific to a selected asset.

.The Guided Decision Table - Overview Tab
image::3449.png[A screen shot of the asset editor - Overview tab]


.Source Tab
Source tab shows the DRL source for a selected asset.

.The Guided Decision Table - Source Tab
image::3448.png[A screen shot of the asset editor - source tab]


.Data Objects Tab
The Data Objects tab suggests the set of imports used in the project. Each asset has its own imports and suggested fact types (that means data objects) that the user might want to use. See **(expand content from data-objects-create-proc.adoc) for more information about data objects.

.The Guided Decision Table - Data Objects Tab
image::3625.png[A screen shot of the asset editor - config tab]

// All of the options need to be defined. Until we do so, having just this one is odd.

[id='_saliance']
=== Salience

Each rule has a salience value which is an integer value that defaults to zero.
The salience value represents the priority of the rule with higher salience values representing higher priority.
Salience values can be positive or negative.


[From previous Overview chapter for "Testing a decision service" assembly. Nixed incorporated most of it in proc chapters, etc.]

= Testing overview

While developing or enhancing a decision service in {CENTRAL}, you might need to test it and ensure that it is producing the correct output.

Rule sets can become complicated and changes might sometimes lead to unexpected results. To avoid this problem, it is important to run the decision service on predefined input information and make sure that the output matches expectations.

To test your decision service in {CENTRAL}, create _Test Scenarios_. In a Test Scenario, you can enter a set of facts on which the rules can be used, the method to run, and the expected result.

At any time during the development process in {CENTRAL} you can run one test scenario or all test scenarios together. The system fires the rules as necessary. It reports an error if the actual result is different from the expected result. You do not have to compile or deploy your decision service to apply test scenarios.

After deploying a decision service on a {KIE_SERVER}, you can test it in two ways:

* Create an application that calls the service and complete tests using an application testing framework, such as TestNG.
* Use a web interface of the {KIE_SERVER} to make calls to its API and view results.


[From potential chapter on using the Decision Server API to test a decision service. Decided not to use, for now.]

[id='kieserver-api-test-con']
= API calls on the {KIE_SERVER}

In addition to testing a decision service with test scenarios in {CENTRAL}, you can also test the service with API calls on the {KIE_SERVER} after the project has been deployed to the server. You can create an application that calls the service and completes tests using an application testing framework, such as TestNG, or use the {KIE_SERVER} web interface to make API calls and validate results.

[id='api-kieserver-testing-proc']
= Using the {KIE_SERVER} web interface to test API calls

If you do not have an application that can call the decision service after it has been deployed to the {KIE_SERVER}, you can use the http://localhost:8080/kie-server/docs[{KIE_SERVER} web interface] to test calls to the service.

.Procedure

Describe initiating DM/BA and Decision Server (kie-server) and using the swagger API interface to test calls.
