= Managing project deployment in {CENTRAL}

You can use {CENTRAL} to manage project deployment on one or more {KIE_SERVERS}. Each {KIE_SERVER} must be configured to connect to {CENTRAL}. Services in a project run in a KIE container, or _deployment unit_, on a {KIE_SERVER}. You can create deployment units and start them on {KIE_SERVERS}. When you build and deploy a project, the deployment unit is created automatically in the configured server. You can start, stop, and remove deployment units as needed.
