= Pages

A page, also known as a perspective in technical / developer jargon, is a logical grouping of related panels, parts and components. A page will have core component(s) and may or may not have navigational and reporting components. The Workbench supports both developer created pages as well as end user created ones. The page builder (Content Management) tool is used to create the pages.

A page can have two style types:
* Fluid: This style creates a classical web page with a vertical scroll bar when the page exceeds the available height.
* Page: This style creates a web page that will always fit to the windows height.
