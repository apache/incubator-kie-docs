= Pages

A page, also known as a perspective in technical or developer jargon, is a collection of different types of components.

There are three types of components. They are as follows:

* Core Components
* Navigational Components
* Reporting Components

A page can consist of zero or multiple instances of any of the component types available. The *Page Authoring* tool is used to create the pages.

A page can have either of the following two styles:

* *Fluid Style*: A classical web page with a vertical scroll bar when the page exceeds the available height.
* *Page Style*: A web page that will always fit to the windows height.
