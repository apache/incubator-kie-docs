= Pages

A page, also known as a perspective in technical or developer jargon, is a logical grouping of related panels, parts and components. A page consists of the following three types of components:

* Core Components
* Navigational Components
* Reporting Components

A page will have (one or more) core component(s) and may or may not have navigational and reporting components. The Workbench supports both developer created pages as well as end user created ones. The *Dashbuilder* (Content Management) tool is used to create the pages.

A page can have either of the following two styles:

* *Fluid Style*: A classical web page with a vertical scroll bar when the page exceeds the available height.
* *Page Style*: A web page that will always fit to the windows height.
