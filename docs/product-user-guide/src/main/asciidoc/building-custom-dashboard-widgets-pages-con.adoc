= Pages

A page, also known as a perspective in technical / developer jargon, is a logical grouping of related panels, parts and components. A page will have core component(s) and may or may not have navigational and reporting components. The Workbench supports both developer created pages as well as end user created ones. The Page Builder (Content Management) tool is used to create the pages.



The user can switch between pages by clicking on one of the top-level menu items; such as "Home", "Authoring", "Deploy" etc.
