A business process application created using {CENTRAL} in {PRODUCT} by citizen developers, depicts the flow of the business process as a series of steps. Each step must be executed as per the process flow chart. A process can consist of one or more number of smaller discrete tasks on whose completion the process transitions from one step to the next. Once business-rule developers automate the business processes and decisions, you as a knowledge worker, will work on its processes and tasks.

Using {PRODUCT}, the mortgage department of a financial institution can automate the complete business process for a mortgage loan. Whenever a new mortgage request comes in, a new process instance is created in the mortgage application. As all requests follow the same set of rules for processing, consistency in every step is ensured. This results in an efficient process which reduces processing time and effort.
