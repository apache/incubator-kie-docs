= Using standalone custom pages(dashboards)

Apart from standalone perspectives, you can also embed custom pages (also known as dashboards) in your application. For accessing the custom pages from your application, provide the name of the custom page as the value of the `perspective` parameter. Note that the `perspective` parameter is case-sensitive.

.Procedure
. Login to {CENTRAL}.
. In a web browser, enter the link of the custom page in the address bar, for example,
+
`http://localhost:8080/business-central/kie-wb.jsp?standalone=true&perspective=CustomPageName`
+
This will open the standalone custom page in the browser. Replace the value, _CustomPageName_, with the name of the custom page you want to use in the standalone mode.
