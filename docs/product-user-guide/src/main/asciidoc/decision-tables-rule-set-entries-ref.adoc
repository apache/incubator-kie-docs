= RuleSet entries

Entries in a Rule Set area may define DRL constructs (except rules), and specify rule attributes. While entries for constructs may be used repeatedly, each rule attribute may be given at most once, and it applies to all rules unless it is overruled by the same attribute being defined within the Rule Table area.

Entries must be given in a vertically stacked sequence of cell pairs. The first one contains a keyword and the one to its right the value. This sequence of cell pairs may be interrupted by blank rows or even a Rule Table, as long as the column marked by `RuleSet` is upheld as the one containing the keyword.
