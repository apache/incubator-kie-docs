= Project deployment without {CENTRAL}

As an alternative to developing and deploying projects in the {CENTRAL} interface, you can use independent Maven projects or your own Java applications to develop {PRODUCT} projects and deploy them in KIE containers (deployment units) to a configured {KIE_SERVER}. You can then use the {KIE_SERVER} REST API to start, stop, or remove the KIE containers that contain the services and their project versions that you have built and deployed. This flexibility enables you to continue to use your existing application work flow to develop business assets using {PRODUCT} features.

Projects in {CENTRAL} are packaged automatically when you build and deploy the projects. For projects outside of {CENTRAL}, such as independent Maven projects or projects within a Java application, you must configure the KIE module descriptor settings in an appended `kmodule.xml` file or directly in your Java application in order to build and deploy the projects.
