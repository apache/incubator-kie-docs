= API calls on the {KIE_SERVER}

In addition to testing a decision service with test scenarios in {CENTRAL}, you can also test the service with API calls on the {KIE_SERVER} after the project has been deployed to the server. You can create an application that calls the service and completes tests using an application testing framework, such as TestNG, or use the {KIE_SERVER} web interface to make API calls and validate results.
