= Process Instances

You can create new process instances in two ways:

* Click *Menu* -> *Manage* -> *Process Definitions*. Select the process definition for which you want to start a new process instance and click the *New Process Intance* button in the upper-right corner.
* Click *Menu -> *Manage* -> *Process Instances*. Click the *New Process Instance* button in the upper-right corner and select the process definition for which you want to start a new process instance from the drop-down list. 

Provide any information required to start a new process instance. Click *Submit* to create a new process instance. The new process instance appears in the list under the *Manage Process Instances* view.

You can further manage the instance during runtime, monitor its execution, and work with the tasks the instance produces for users with the proper roles assigned.

Additionally, {CENTRAL} enables you to easily sort and filter a list of tasks for any given process. You can create custom filters that enable you to define queries by user, business attributes (such as amount, customer segmentation), Process ID, correlation key, and so on.

You can view the list of all the running process instances in the Process Instance List under *Menu* -> *Manage* -> *Process Instances*.
