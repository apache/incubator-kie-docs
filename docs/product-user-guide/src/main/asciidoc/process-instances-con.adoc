= Process Instances

You can create new process instances from the *Process Definition List*, from the *Process Definition Detail* view or from the *Process Instance* view. When you create a new Process Instance, a new window opens that requires you to provide information required by the process to be started. After you provide the required information and click *Submit*, the instance is created and the details of the process instance are displayed in *Process Instance Details* on the right.

You can further manage the instance during runtime, monitor its execution, and work with the tasks the instance produces for users with the proper roles assigned.

Additionally, {CENTRAL} enables you to easily sort and filter a list of tasks for any given process. You can create custom filters that enable you to define queries by user, business attributes (such as amount, customer segmentation), Process ID, correlation key, and so on.

You can view the list of all the running process instances in the Process Instance List under *Menu* -> *Manage* -> *Process Instances*.
The process instances view comprises two main sections:

* Process Instance Lists
* Process Instance Details

The process instance list displays the process instances. In this view, you can customize which columns  are displayed, then number of rows displayed per page, the name of the tabs, and the title description.
The views are available as tabs. When you click a tab, the associated parameters are applied to the data grid and the corresponding process instances are listed. You can remove the default tabs and add your own with the required filter criteria.
The Process Instances view also has features such as auto refresh and restore default views. Auto refresh enables you to define how frequently the data grid refreshes. You can select a different value (1, 5 or 10 minutes), or disable this feature by clicking the *Disable* button:

Each row in the process instance list represents a running process instance from a particular process definition.
Each execution is differentiated from all the others by the internal state of the information that the process is manipulating.
In order to view this information, you can click on any one of the process instances and view the corresponding details in the *Process Instance Details* section.
The *Process Instance Details* provides several tabs with the runtime information related to the process.

* The *Instance Details* tab: This gives you a quick overview about what is going on inside the process. It displays the current state of the instance and the current activity that is being executed.
* The *Process Variables* tab: This displays all the process variables that are being manipulated by the instance, with the exception of the variables that contain documents. You can move the mouse pointer over the *Value* field to view a full value of the process variable. Additionally, you can edit the process variable value and view its history.
* The *Documents* tab: This displays process documents if the process contains a variable of the type *org.jbpm.Document*. This enables easy access, download, and manipulation of the attached documents. You can not attach a new document to currently running instances using this view, but it can be achieved by Human task form in the tasks page.
* The *Logs* tab: This displays business and technical logs for the respective end users. In order to track a process through the logs, you can also open the Process Model that shows the completed activies in grey and the current activities highlighted in red.
