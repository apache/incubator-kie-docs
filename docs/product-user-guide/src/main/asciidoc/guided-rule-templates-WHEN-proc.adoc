= Adding WHEN conditions in guided rule templates

The *WHEN* part of the rule is the condition that must be met to execute an action. For example, if a telecommunications company charges customers based on the services they subscribe to (Internet, phone, and TV), then one of the *WHEN* conditions would be `internetService | equal to | $hasInternetService`. The template key `$hasInternetService` is interchanged with an actual Boolean value (`true` or `false`) defined in the data table for the template.

.Prerequisite
All data objects required for your rules are listed in the *Data Objects* tab of the guided rule template designer. See xref:guided-rules-create-proc[] for details.

.Procedure
. In the guided rule template designer, click the plus icon (image:5686.png[]) on the right side of the `WHEN` section.
+
The *Add a condition to the rule* window with the available condition elements opens.
+
.Add a condition to the rule

+
The list includes the data objects from the *Data Objects* tab of the guided rule template designer, any DSL objects defined for the package, and the following standard options:

* *The following does not exist:* Use this to specify facts and constraints that must not exist.
* *The following exists:* Use this to specify facts and constraints that must exist. This option is triggered on only the first match, not subsequent matches.
* *Any of the following are true:* Use this to list facts and constraints that must be true.
* *From:* Use this to define a `From` conditional element for the rule.
* *From Accumulate:* Use this to define an `Accumulate` conditional element for the rule.
* *From Collect:* Use this to define a `Collect` conditional element for the rule.
* *From Entry Point:* Use this to define an `Entry Point` for the pattern.
* *Free form DRL:* Use this to insert a free-form DRL field where you can define condition elements freely, without the guided rule designer. For template keys in free form DRL, use the format `@key`.
+
. Choose a condition element (for example, *Customer*) and click *Ok*.
. Click the condition element in the guided rule template designer and use the *Modify constraints for Customer* window to add a restriction on a field, apply multiple field constraints, add a new formula style expression, apply an expression editor, or set a variable name.
. Modify the condition to suit your needs. For example, you can set a variable name to help define the condition, or you can add a restriction.
+
.Modify a condition

+
Once you select a restriction, the window closes automatically.
. Choose an operator for the restriction (for example, `equal to`) from the drop-down menu next to the added restriction.
. Click the edit icon (image:6191.png[]) to define the field value.
. Select *Template key* and add a template key in the format `$key` if this value varies among the rules based on this template. This allows the field value to be interchanged with actual values that you define in the corresponding data table to generate different rules from the same template. For field values that do not vary among the rules and are part of the rule template, you can use any other value type.
. To apply multiple field constraints, click the condition and in the *Modify constraints for Customer* window, select *All of(And)* or *Any of(Or)* from the *Multiple field constraint* drop-down menu.
+
.Add multiple field constraints

. Click the constraint in the guided rule template designer and further define the field values.
. After you define all condition elements, click *Save* in the guided rule template designer to save your work.
