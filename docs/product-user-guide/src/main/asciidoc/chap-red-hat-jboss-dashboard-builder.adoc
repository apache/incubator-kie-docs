= Red Hat JBoss Dashboard Builder

Red Hat JBoss Dashboard Builder
 is a web-based dashboard application that provides Business Activity Monitoring (BAM) support, that is, visualization tools for monitored metrics (Key Performance Indicators, or KPIs) in real time.
It comes integrated in the Business Central environment under the *Dashboards* menu.

It comes with a dashboard that requests information from the Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite Execution Engine and provides real-time information on its runtime data; however, you can also create custom dashboards over other data sources, which leaves the application relatively standalone.

== What is Business Activity Monitoring?


Business Activity Monitoring (BAM) software helps to monitor business activities that take place on a computer system in real time.
The software monitors particular metrics, such as the status of running processes, the number of invoices to be processed, processing times and other.
It provides tools for visualization of the collected data (for example in graphs or tables).

[id='_structure']
== Basic Concepts


Dashboard Builder can establish connections to external data sources such as databases.
These connections are then used for creating data providers that obtain data from the data sources.
Dashboard Builder is connected to the local JBoss BPM Suite engine by default and acquires the data for its JBoss BPM Suite Dashboard indicators (widgets with visualizations of the data available on the pages of the JBoss BPM Suite Dashboard workspace).

The data providers keep all the data.
If operating over a database, the data provider uses an SQL query to obtain the data.
Operating over a CSV file enables the data provider automatically obtain all the data from the file.

Data from the data providers can then be visualized as graphs or tables in indicators: special panels, that can be arranged on Dashboard Builder managed pages.
Pages are contained within a workspace and can define permission access rights.
The number of pages within a workspace is arbitrary.
A set of pages that presents related information on similar KPIs is referred to as a dashboard.

[id='_accessing_dashboard_builder']
== Accessing Dashboard Builder


Dashboard Builder is accessible through Business Central and as a standalone application.

Within Business Central, Dashboard Builder can be accessed directly from the *Dashboards* menu at the top. The *Dashboards* menu contains two items:

* *Process & Task Dashboard* displays a pre-defined dashboard based on runtime data from the Execution Server. To learn more about Process & Task Dashboard, see <<_process_and_task_dashboard>>.
* *Business Dashboards* displays an environment in which you can create your own dashboards. This chapter contains procedures that provide instructions on how to create a custom dashboard.


.Procedure: Accessing Dashboard Builder as a Standalone Application
--
Dashboard Builder can be accessed as a standalone application as well.

. Start the server.
. After the server has successfully started, navigate to `https://_HOST_NAME:PORT_/dashbuilder` in a web browser. For example https://localhost:8080/dashbuilder.
. Log in with the user credentials created during installation.
--

After you log in, you are redirected to the *Showcase* workspace with the welcome page displayed.

At the top of the page, you can change the workspace, the page, as well as find general configuration buttons. This interface area is common for all workspaces.

Dashboard area with variable content, a lateral menu on the left and the main dashboard area on the right, is located below the common interface area.

[id='_process_and_task_dashboard']
== Process & Task Dashboard


The *Process & Task Dashboard* contains several performance indicators monitoring the jBPM Execution Engine. The data used by the dashboard comes from two tables of the database belonging to the engine: `processinstancelog` and ``bamtasksummary``.

.The Process & Task Dashboard Main Screen
image::processandtaskdashboard.png[]


Every time the information stored into the database is updated, the data becomes automatically available to the dashboard indicators.

[NOTE]
====
All the metrics are generic and do not belong to any specific business process.
However, it is possible to modify or extend the generic dashboard for your own use: the jBPM Process Dashboard can serve as a template for building a custom dashboard, which works with both data of the jBPM Engine and data coming from your own business domain.
====


At the top of the *Process & Task Dashboard*
 main screen, you can choose whether you want to view indicators related to *Processes* or *Tasks*.

You can filter the data by clicking the charts, for example if you want to select a particular process or status.
Every time a filter is applied, all the indicators are automatically updated and synchronized to show the selected criteria.
The following picture shows an example dashboard with the `Sales` process and the `Active` status selected.

.Active Sales Processes
image::activesalesprocesses.png[]


It is also possible to display a list of instances at any time by clicking the *Show Instances*
 link in the upper right hand corner of the screen.
You can then switch to the original screen by clicking the *Show Dashboard*
 link.

.Process Instances List
image::processinstancelist.png[]


You can sort the instances by clicking any column header.
Details about a particular instance are shown on the right side of the page after selecting a row.
Note that the displayed details are not editable.
If you want to manage a process instance, go to *Process Management* -> *Process Instances*
 in Business Central.

[id='_tasks_dashboard']
=== Tasks Dashboard


To view the *Tasks* dashboard, click the *Tasks* tab at the top of the screen.
This dashboard provides the same features as introduced above, but related to the tasks only.


[id='_data_sources_con']
== Data Source Management

In the data source management system you can define data sources for accessing external databases. To configure database connections, click image:settings-button.png[Settings button] -> *Data Sources*. 

Connect the Dashboard Builder to an external database by first connecting the database in one of two ways:

* Specify the JNDI name of the data source. This links to the data source on the application server. 
* Connect to the database directly by specifying the JDBC driver name of the data source.

These data sources can be later used by other workbench components, including xref:data_sets_con[Data Sets]. Once the database connection has been established, you can select one of its corresponding data sets from the list of available data sets in the Dashboard Builder Displayer component.

[id='_data-source-explorer_con']
=== The *DataSource Explorer*

The *DataSource Explorer* is a data source management system that allows you to define data sources for accessing external databases. Other workbench components, such as xref:data_sets_con[Data Sets], also use these data sources. The *Datasource Explorer* perspective can be accessed from anywhere inside Business Central by clicking image:settings-button.png[Settings button] -> *Data Sources*. 

[NOTE]
====
The *DataSource Explorer* perspective is only available to administration users. 
====

The *Datasource Explorer* allows you to view and manage the data sources and JDBC drivers that are defined in the system. From this perspective, you can complete the following operations:

* Create a new data source.
* View the list of available data sources.
* Create a new driver.
* View the list of available drivers.


[id='_adding-data-source_task']
=== Adding a New Data Source

All tools for authoring data sources and data sets are available in the *DataSource Explorer* perspective. To access this perspective, click image:settings-button.png[Settings button] -> *Data Sources*.

To connect to an external data source, do the following:

.Prerequisite

* The data source is up and running.
* The application server has access to the data source. 
+
In {EAP} 7, verify access to the data source and review settings in the Management Console under *Configuration* -> *Subsystems* -> *Datasources*.

.Procedure
. From anywhere in Business Central, click *Settings* image:settings-button.png[Settings button] -> *Data Sources*. 
. In the *DataSource Explorer* perspective, click the *Add DataSource* image:5456.png[] button to open the *New data source* wizard.
+
image:data-source-wizard.png[New data source]

. Enter the following required parameters:
* *Name*: A unique name for the data source definition.
* *Connection URL*: A JDBC database connection URL compliant with the selected driver type. The following is an example for a PostgreSQL database:
+
----
jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/appformer
----

* *User*: A user name in the target database.
* *Password*: The password of the user.
* *Driver*: Selects the JDBC driver to be used for connecting to the target database. The connection URL format might vary depending on the driver, and different database vendors typically provide different drivers.

. Click the *Test Connection* button to show the connection test status.
+
[NOTE]
====
Using the *Test Connection* feature is not a requirement, however it is best practice that you use it to check the data source parameters prior to completing the data source creation.
====

You can modify the data source configuration parameters in the *Data Source Definition* editor by clicking the data source in the list under *Data Sources* in the *DataSource Explorer*.

ifdef::BA[]
If you want the Dashboard to use the new data source, you must also modify the respective data providers ({PRODUCT_BA} Count Processes, {PRODUCT_BA} Process Summary, {PRODUCT_BA} Task Summary). Note that the data source must have access to {PRODUCT_BA} history.
endif::BA[]


[id='_data-source-browser_con']
=== Data Source Content Browser

To access the data source content browser:

. Open the *DataSource Explorer* by clicking *Settings* image:settings-button.png[Settings button] -> *Data Sources*.
. Select a data source from the list under *Data Sources*.
. Click the *Browse Content* button in the *Data Source Definition* editor.
+
image:data-source-editor.png[Data Source Definition]

The content browser allows you to navigate through the structure of the data source target database. This navigation is performed at three levels:

Schemas level:: This level lists all the database schemas accessible by the selected data source. The list of schemas displayed is based on the database access rights of the user as defined in the connection configuration. This also applies to the selected schema level.
Current schema level:: This level shows all database tables for the selected schema.
Current table level:: This level shows the table content for the selected table.

In the data source content browser, clicking the *Open* button opens the next level for each item. 


[id='_external-data-sources_con']
=== External Data Sources

External data sources exist in the current container and are not typically defined in the current workbench. For some containers, such as Wildfly 10 or {EAP} 7 servers, they can be listed in read-only mode. In this case, only the data source content browser is enabled, and you cannot edit any configuration parameters using the *Data Source Definition* editor. 

For example:
image:example-data-source.png[ExampleDS]

[IMPORTANT]
====
When creating an external data source using *DataSource Explorer*, the data source needs to use the local connection so that the user can be passed through.
Otherwise, with a connection that uses <host>:<port>, every user would have the same virtual database (VDB) permissions.
====


[id='_database-drivers_con']
=== Database Drivers

In order to communicate with the target database, a data source requires a database driver. You can add and configure database drivers in the *DataSource Explorer* perspective. A database driver is a JDBC-compliant driver. 

{PRODUCT} includes the following default drivers. These drivers are configured for the most commonly used open source databases and aligned with the latest database versions supported by the Wildfly 10 and {EAP} 7 servers:

* MariaDB-1.3.4
* MySQL-5.1.38
* PostgreSQL-9.4.1207

[id='_adding-datasource-driver_task']
=== Adding a New Driver

You can add a new driver in the *DataSource Explorer* perspective. To access this perspective, click image:settings-button.png[Settings button] -> *Data Sources*.

.Procedure

. Under the *Drivers* menu, click image:add-driver.png[Add Driver] to open the *New driver* wizard.
. Enter the following required parameters:

* *Name*: A unique name for the driver definition.
* *Driver Class Name*: The fully-qualified Java name for the class that implements the JDBC driver contract.
* *Group Id*: The Maven group ID for the artifact that contains the JDBC driver implementation.
* *Artifact Id*: The Maven artifact ID for the artifact that contains the JDBC driver implementation.
* *Version*: The Maven version for the artifact that contains the JDBC driver implementation.

. Click *Finish*.

Some commercial database drivers are not available in the Maven central repository. To use commercial drivers, upload them with the *Artifact Repository* perspective and then continue with the driver configuration process, similar to other drivers available in the Maven central repository.

To modify the driver configuration parameters in the *Driver Definition* editor, click the driver in the list under *Drivers* in the *DataSource Explorer*.


[id='_building_a_dashboard_for_large_volumes_of_data']
== Building a Dashboard for Large Volumes of Data

You can connect Red Hat JBoss Dashboard Builder to external databases and load data for generating reports and charts. Generally, if the volume of data is small (up to 2MB), Red Hat JBoss Dashboard Builder preloads the data into (local) memory and uses this data for report and chart generation.
However, in case of large volumes of data, it is not possible to load the entire data set into the Dashboard Builder's local memory.

Based on the volume of data you are dealing with, you can choose to query the database to build a dashboard report in any one of the following strategies:

* The in-memory strategy
+
The in-memory strategy is to create a data provider that loads all the required data from the database by executing a single SQL query on the relevant tables, into the Dashboard Builder's memory.
In this case, every indicator on the Dashboard Builder shares the same data set.
When you use filters from the Dashboard Builder user interface to access specific data from this data set, the Dashboard Builder fetches the data from the internal memory and does not execute another SQL query again on the database.
This strategy has a simple data retrieval logic as it deals with creating a single data provider.
As all the data set properties are available to you at once, it allows you to configure KPIs faster.
However, this approach is not suitable for large data sets as it would lead to poor performance.
+
* The native strategy
+
The native approach is to create a data provider for every indicator in the Dashboard Builder and does not require loading all the data into the internal memory at once.
So each time you use a filter from the Dashboard Builder user interface, the corresponding SQL queries get executed and fetches the required data from the database.
So there is no data in the Dashboard Builder's internal memory.
This strategy works best in case of large volumes of data, however it needs proper indexing on the database tables.
Also, setting up data providers for multiple KPIs is complicated as compared to creating a single data provider in case of in-memory strategy.


.Example
Let us consider a case when you want to create a stock exchange dashboard comprising the following charts and reports:

* Bar chart for Average price per company
* Area chart for Sales price evolution
* Pie chart for Companies per country
* Table report for Stock prices at closing date


For these charts and reports, let us assume that the Dashboard Builder accesses data from the following tables:

* Company: Comprising columns ID, NAME, and COUNTRY.
* Stock: Comprising columns ID, ID_COMPANY, PRICE_PER_SHARE, and CLOSING_DATE.


For the in-memory strategy of building a dashboard, the following SQL query fetches all the required data from these two tables:

[source]
----
SELECT C.NAME, C.COUNTRY, S.PRICE_PER_SHARE, S.CLOSING_DATE
  FROM COMPANY C JOIN STOCK S ON (C.ID=S.ID_COMPANY)
----

The output of this query is saved in the Dashboard Builder's local memory.
The Dashboard accesses this data every time a filter is run.

On the other hand, if you are using the native strategy for huge volumes of data, an SQL query is executed on every filter request made by the Dashboard Builder and corresponding data is fetched from the database.
In this case here is how each filter accesses the database:

* For the bar chart on __Average price per company__, the following SQL query is executed:
+

[source]
----
SELECT C.NAME, AVG(S.PRICE_PER_SHARE)
  FROM COMPANY C JOIN STOCK S ON (C.ID=S.ID_COMPANY)
  WHERE {sql_condition, optional, c.country, country}
  AND {sql_condition, optional, c.name, name}
  GROUP BY C.NAME
----
* For the area chart on __Sales price evolution__, the following SQL query is executed:
+

[source]
----
SELECT S.CLOSING_DATE, AVG(S.PRICE_PER_SHARE)
  FROM COMPANY C JOIN STOCK S ON (C.ID=S.ID_COMPANY)
  WHERE {sql_condition, optional, c.country, country}
  AND {sql_condition, optional, c.name, name}
  GROUP BY CLOSING_DATE
----
* For the pie chart on __Companies per country__, the following SQL query is executed:
+

[source]
----
SELECT COUNTRY, COUNT(ID)
  FROM COMPANY
  WHERE {sql_condition, optional, country, country}
  AND {sql_condition, optional, name, name}
  GROUP BY COUNTRY
----
* For the table report on __Stock prices at closing date__, the following SQL query is executed:
+

[source]
----
SELECT C.NAME, C.COUNTRY, S.PRICE_PER_SHARE, S.CLOSING_DATE
  FROM COMPANY C JOIN STOCK S ON (C.ID=S.ID_COMPANY)
  WHERE {sql_condition, optional, c.country, country}
  AND {sql_condition, optional, c.name, name}
----


For each of these queries, you need to create a separate SQL data provider.

In the examples above, each KPI delegates the filter and group by operations to the database through the `{sql_condition}` clauses.
The signature of the `{sql_condition}` clause is the following:
[source]
----
  {sql_condition, [optional | required], [db column], [filter property]}
----
Here,

* optional: This indicates that if there is no filter for the given property, then the condition is ignored.
* required: This indicates that if there is no filter for the given property, then the SQL returns no data.
* db column: This indicates the database column where the current filter is applied.
* filter property: This indicates the selected UI filter property.


When a filter occurs in the UI, the Dashboard Builder parses and injects all the SQL data providers referenced by the KPIs into these SQL statements.
Every time a filter occurs in the UI, the Dashboard Builder gets all the SQL data providers referenced by the KPIs and injects the current filter selections made by the user into these SQLs.

[id='_sect_data_providers']
=== Data Providers


Data providers are entities that are configured to connect to a data source (a CSV file or database), collect the required data, and assign them the data type.
You can think about them as database queries.

The collected data can be then visualized in indicators on pages, exported as XLS or CSV, etc.

[id='_creating_data_provider']
=== Creating Data Providers


To create a new data provider:

.Procedure
. In the Tree Menu (the panel in the lateral menu of the Showcase workspace), click *Administration* -> *Data providers*.
. In the *Data Providers* panel, click the *Create new data provider* image:5457.png[] button.
. In the updated *Data Providers* panel, select in the *Type* dropdown menu the type of the data provider depending on the source you want the data provider to operate on.
. Define the data provider parameters:
+
Data provider over a CSV file::
* Name: user-friendly name and its locale.
* CSV file URL: the URL of the file (for example, `file:///home/me/example.csv`).
* Data separator: the symbol used as separator in the CSV file (the default value is semicolon; if using comma as the separator sign, make sure to adapt the number format if applicable).
* Quoting symbol: the symbol used for quotes (the default value is the double-quotes symbol; note that the symbol may vary depending on the locale).
* Escaping symbol: the symbol used for escaping the following symbol in order to keep its literal value.
* Date format: the date and time format.
* Number format: the number format pattern as used in `java.text.DecimalFormat`.
+

Data provider over a database (SQL query)::

+
* Name: user-friendly name and its locale
* Data source: the data source to query (the default value is ``local``, which allows you to query the Dashboard Builder database)
* Query: query that returns the required data
. Click *Attempt data load* image:5458.png[] to verify the parameters are correct.
. Click *Save*.
. In the table with the detected data, define the data type and if necessary provide a user-friendly name for the data. Click *Save*.


The data provider can now be visualized in an indicator on a page of your choice.

[id='_sect_workspace']
== Workspace


A workspace is a container for pages with panels or indicators.

ifdef::BA[]
By default, the Showcase and Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite Dashboard workspaces are available.
endif::BA[]

To switch between workspaces, select the required workspace in the Workspace drop-down box in the top panel on the left.
To create a new workspace, click the *Create workspace* icon (image:2658.png[]) in the top menu on the left.
You can also edit the current workspace properties, delete the current workspace, and duplicate the current workspace using icons in the top panel.

Every workspace uses a particular skin and envelope, which define the workspace's graphical properties.

[id='_creating_a_workspace']
=== Creating a Workspace


To create a new workspace, do the following:

. Click the *Create workspace* button on the top menu.
+
The management console with the *Workspace* node expanded and workspace management area with workspace details on the right is displayed.
. In the *Create workspace* table on the right, set the workspace parameters:

. Optionally, click the workspace name in the tree menu on the left and in the area with workspace properties on the right define additional workspace parameters:
* URL: the workspace URL
* User home search: the home page setting
+
If set to `Role assigned page`, the home page as in the page permissions is applied; that is, every role can have a different page displayed as its home page.
If set to `Current page`, all users will use the current home page as their home page.


[id='_sect_pages']
=== Pages


Pages are units that live in a workspace and provide space (dashboard) for panels.
By default, you can display a page by selecting it in the Page dropdown menu in the top panel.

Every page is divided in two main parts: the lateral menu and the central part of the page.
The parts are divided further (the exact division is visible when placing a new panel on a page). Note that the lateral menu allows you to insert panels only below each other, while in the central part of the page you can insert panels below each other as well as tab them.

A page also has a customizable header part and logo area.

==== Creating Pages


To create a new page, do the following:

. Make sure you are in the correct workspace.
. Next to the *Page* dropdown box image:5459.png[] in the top menu, click the *Create new page* image:5460.png[] button.
. The management console with the *Pages* node expanded and page management area with page details on the right is displayed.
. In the *Create new page* table on the right, set the page parameters:

[id='_page_permissions1']
==== Defining Page Permissions


Although users are usually authorized using the authorization method setup for the underlying application container (on Red Hat JBoss EAP, the `other` security domain by default), the Red Hat JBoss Dashboard Builder
 has its own role-based access control (RBAC) management tool to facilitate permission management on an individual page or multiple pages.

To define permissions on a page or all workspace pages for a role, do the following:

. On the top menu, click the *General configuration* image:5461.png[] button: the management console is displayed.
. Under the *Workspace* node on the left, locate the page or the *Pages* node.
. Under the page/pages node, click the *Page permissions* node.
. In the *Page permissions* area on the right, delete previously defined permission definition if applicable and define the rights for the required role:
.. In the *Permission assignation* table, locate the *Select role* dropdown menu and pick the respective role.
.. In the *Actions* column of the table, enable or disable individual permissions.
. Click *Save*.


[id='_sect_panels']
=== Panels


A panel is a GUI widget, which can be placed on a page.
There are three main types of panels:

Dashboard panels::
are the primary BAM panels and include the following:

* Data provider manager: a panel with a list of available data providers and data provider management options
* Filter and Drill-down: a panel that displays all KPIs and their values to facilitate filtering in indicators on the given page defined over a data provider
* HTML Editor panel: a panel with static content
* Key Performance Indicator (indicator): a panel that visualizes the data of a data provider

Navigation panels::
are panels that provide navigation functions and include the following:

* Export/Import workspaces: a panel for exporting and importing of workspaces

[id='_adding_panels']
==== Adding Panels


To add an existing panel to a page or to create a new panel, do the following:

. Make sure the respective page is open (in the *Page* dropdown menu of the top menu select the page).
. In the top menu, click the *Create a new panel in current page* image:5462.png[] button.
. In the displayed dialog box, expand the panel type you want to add (*Dashboard*, *Navigation*, or *System*) and click the panel you wish to add.
. From the *Components* menu on the left, drag and drop the name of an existing panel instance or the *Create panel* item into the required location on the page.
+
If inserting a new indicator, the Panel view with the graph settings will appear.Define the graph details and close the dialog.
+
If adding an instance of an already existing indicator, you might not be able to use it, if it is linked to the KPIs on the particular original page. In such a case, create a new panel.
. If applicable, edit the content of the newly added panel.


[id='_import_and_export']
== Import and Export


Dashboard Builder provides the ability to export and import workspaces, KPIs, and data sources between two Dashboard Builder installations.

In general, it is possible to export the mentioned assets only using the Dashboard Builder web user interface.
However, you can import the assets either in the web user interface, or by using the deployment scanner.

The deployment scanner is a subsystem of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform that allows you to place the exported assets into the given folder inside the web application.
Once the application has started, it scans the deployment folder and imports all the available assets.
Note that the assets can be imported only during the deployment and _not_ during the runtime.

=== Importing and Exporting Workspaces


By importing or exporting workspaces, you can move a set of pages between two Dashboard Builder installations.
The procedure moves an envelope being currently used by the workspace, all the sections that compose the workspace and all the panels used in the workspace sections.

.Procedure: Exporting Workspaces
. In Business Central, go to *Dashboards* -> *Business Dashboards*.
. In the menu on the left, click *Administration* -> *Import and export*.
. Choose the *Export Workspaces* tab.
. In the list of all existing workspaces that opens, select the ones you want to export and click *Export*.
+
image::export-workspaces.png[]
. Click *Download* to download a single XML file containing the workspace definitions.


.Procedure: Importing Workspaces Using Web UI
. In Business Central, go to *Dashboards* -> *Business Dashboards*.
. In the menu on the left, click *Administration* -> *Import and export*.
. Choose the *Import Workspace* tab.
+
image::import-workspace.png[]
. Upload an XML file that contains one or more workspace definitions. Uploading a ZIP archive is supported as well for backward compatibility.
. Click *Import*.


.Procedure: Importing Workspaces Using Deployment Scanner
. Make sure that the XML workspace definition file has the extension ``$$.$$workspace``.
. Move the file into the `/jboss-eap-6.4/standalone/deployments/dashbuilder.war/WEB-INF/deployments` directory.
+
If the workspace already exists (there is a workspace with the same logic identifier), the file will be overwritten. Note that these two files do not have to have the same name in order to be replaced.


The workspaces are imported once during the application deployment.

[id='_importing_and_exporting_kpis']
=== Importing and Exporting KPIs


By importing and exporting KPIs, you can move key performance indicator definitions (the KPI type, its columns and display configuration) and their data providers between two Dashboard Builder installations.

.Procedure: Exporting KPIs
. In Business Central, go to *Dashboards* -> *Business Dashboards*.
. In the menu on the left, click *Administration* -> *Import and export*.
. Choose the *Export Dashboards* tab.
+
A list of all KPI definitions in your application opens.
You can export one or more of them into a single XML file.
+
image::export-dashboards.png[]
. Select the KPIs you want to export and click *Export* .
+
image::export-dashboards-selected.png[]

.Procedure: Importing KPIs Using Web UI
. In Business Central, go to *Dashboards* -> *Business Dashboards*.
. In the menu on the left, click *Administration* -> *Import and export*.
. Choose the *Import dashboards* tab.
+
image::import-dashboards.png[]
. Upload an XML file that contains one or more KPI definitions and click *Import.*


.Procedure: Importing KPIs Using Deployment Scanner
. Make sure that the XML KPI definition file has the extension ``$$.$$kpis``.
. Move the file into the `/jboss-eap-6.4/standalone/deployments/dashbuilder.war/WEB-INF/deployments` directory.
+
If the KPI or the data provider already exists (there is a file that contains a KPI or a data provider with the same logic identifier), the file will be overwritten.
Note that these two files do not have to have the same name in order to be replaced.


The KPIs are imported once during the application deployment.

[id='_importing_data_sources']
=== Importing Data Sources

[NOTE]
====
At present, it is _not_ possible to export data sources.
====


By importing and exporting data sources, you can move one or more external data source connection configurations between two Dashboard Builder installations.

Since the data sources definitions consist of a very small number of attributes, it is possible to create them in your target environment manually by using the *External connections* panel.

.Procedure: Creating Data Sources Manually Using Web UI

.Procedure: Importing Data Sources Using Deployment Scanner
. Create the data sources definition files with the following supported properties:
* common properties:
** ``type``: the type of the data source (``JNDI`` or ``JDBC``),
** ``name``: the data source name,
** ``testQuery``: a definition of a query used for testing the data source during the instantiation.
* JNDI data source properties:
** ``jndiPath``: the data source bean path.
+
.JNDI Data Source Descriptor
====
[source]
----

type = JNDI
name = myCompanyDataSource
testQuery = SELECT count(*) FROM CUSTOMER
jndiPath = java:comp/env/jdbc/mycompany
----
====
* JDBC data source properties:
** ``jdbcUrl``: the JDBC URL for the connection,
** ``driverClass``: a fully qualified class name of the used driver,
** ``user``: the connection user name,
** ``password``: the connection password.
+
.JBDC Data Source Descriptor
====
[source]
----

type = JDBC
name = myCompanyDataSource
testQuery = SELECT count(*) FROM CUSTOMER
jdbcUrl = jdbc:postgresql://mydomain.com:5432/mycompany
driverClass = org.postgresorg.postgresql.Driver
user = system
password = dba
----
====
. Make sure that the data source definition file has the extension ``$$.$$datasource``.
. Move the file into the `/jboss-eap-6.4/standalone/deployments/dashbuilder.war/WEB-INF/deployments` directory.
+
If the data source already exists (there is a file that contains a data source with the same logic identifier), the file will be overwritten.
Note that these two files do not have to have the same name in order to be replaced.


The data sources are imported once during the application deployment.
