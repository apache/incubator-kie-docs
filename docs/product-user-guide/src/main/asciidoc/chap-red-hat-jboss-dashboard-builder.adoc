[id='_chap_red_hat_jboss_dashboard_builder']
= Red Hat JBoss Dashboard Builder

Red Hat JBoss Dashboard Builder component supports Business Activity Monitoring (BAM) using visualization tools for monitoring metrics, such as Key Performance Indicators and process statuses. With the Dashboard Builder, you can compose custom business dashboards by mixing data coming from various data sources and displaying them as graphs or tables, as well as creating custom navigation.

Dashboard Builder is connected to the local JBoss BPM Suite engine by default, and acquires the data for its JBoss BPM Suite Dashboard indicators. Data sources contain custom data that can be used to create data sets. Dashboard Builder can then use these data sets to create custom perspectives. The following types of data sets are supported:

Databases::
This uses an SQL query or table name for obtaining data from an external database.

CSV files::
Operating over a CSV file allows the data provider to obtain all data from the file.

JAR files::
For advanced users. This requires data sets to be generated programmatically by implementing `org.dashbuilder.dataset.DataSetGenerator` and providing this implementation on {CENTRAL}'s classpath. For more information about the Dashbuilder DataSet API, see the {URL_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE}[{DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE}].

Elastic Search::
Data available in the Elastic Search storage system.
+
[IMPORTANT]

[id='_process_and_task_dashboard']
== Processes & Tasks Dashboard
The *Processes & Tasks Dashboard* contains several performance indicators monitoring the {PRODUCT} Execution Engine. The data used by the dashboard comes from two tables of the database belonging to the engine: `processinstancelog` and ``bamtasksummary``.

.The Process & Task Dashboard Main Screen
image::processandtaskdashboard.png[]

Every time the information stored into the database is updated, the data becomes automatically available to the dashboard indicators.

[NOTE]
====
All the metrics are generic and do not belong to any specific business process.
However, it is possible to modify or extend the generic dashboard for your own use: the {PRODUCT} Process Dashboard can serve as a template for building a custom dashboard, which works with both data of the {PRODUCT} Engine and data coming from your own business domain.
====

At the top of the *Process & Task Dashboard*
 main screen, you can choose whether you want to view indicators related to *Processes* or *Tasks*.

You can filter the data by clicking the charts, for example if you want to select a particular process or status.
Every time a filter is applied, all the indicators are automatically updated and synchronized to show the selected criteria.
The following picture shows an example dashboard with the `Sales` process and the `Active` status selected.

.Active Sales Processes
image::activesalesprocesses.png[]


It is also possible to display a list of instances at any time by clicking the *Show Instances*
 link in the upper right hand corner of the screen.
You can then switch to the original screen by clicking the *Show Dashboard*
 link.

.Process Instances List
image::processinstancelist.png[]


You can sort the instances by clicking any column header.
Details about a particular instance are shown on the right side of the page after selecting a row.
Note that the displayed details are not editable.
If you want to manage a process instance, go to *Process Management* -> *Process Instances*
 in {CENTRAL}.

[id='_sect_data_sources']
== Data Sources

[id='_data_sources_con']
== Data Source Management

In the data source management system you can define data sources for accessing external databases. To configure database connections, click image:settings-button.png[Settings button] -> *Data Sources*.

Connect the Dashboard Builder to an external database by first connecting the database in one of two ways:

* Specify the JNDI name of the data source. This links to the data source on the application server.
* Connect to the database directly by specifying the JDBC driver name of the data source.

These data sources can be later used by other workbench components, including xref:data_sets_con[Data Sets]. Once the database connection has been established, you can select one of its corresponding data sets from the list of available data sets in the Dashboard Builder Displayer component.

[id='_data-source-explorer_con']
=== The *DataSource Explorer*

The *DataSource Explorer* is a data source management system that allows you to define data sources for accessing external databases. Other workbench components, such as xref:data_sets_con[Data Sets], also use these data sources. The *Datasource Explorer* perspective can be accessed from anywhere inside {CENTRAL} by clicking image:settings-button.png[Settings button] -> *Data Sources*.

[NOTE]
====
The *DataSource Explorer* perspective is only available to administration users.
====

The *Datasource Explorer* allows you to view and manage the data sources and JDBC drivers that are defined in the system. From this perspective, you can complete the following operations:

* Create a new data source.
* View the list of available data sources.
* Create a new driver.
* View the list of available drivers.


[id='_adding-data-source_task']
=== Adding a New Data Source

All tools for authoring data sources and data sets are available in the *DataSource Explorer* perspective. To access this perspective, click image:settings-button.png[Settings button] -> *Data Sources*.

To connect to an external data source, do the following:

.Prerequisite

* The data source is up and running.
* The application server has access to the data source.
+
In {EAP} 7.1 verify access to the data source and review settings in the Management Console under *Configuration* -> *Subsystems* -> *Datasources*.

.Procedure
. From anywhere in {CENTRAL}, click *Settings* image:settings-button.png[Settings button] -> *Data Sources*.
. In the *DataSource Explorer* perspective, click the *Add DataSource* image:5456.png[] button to open the *New data source* wizard.
+
image:data-source-wizard.png[New data source]

. Enter the following required parameters:
* *Name*: A unique name for the data source definition.
* *Connection URL*: A JDBC database connection URL compliant with the selected driver type. The following is an example for a PostgreSQL database:
+
----
jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/appformer
----

* *User*: A user name in the target database.
* *Password*: The password of the user.
* *Driver*: Selects the JDBC driver to be used for connecting to the target database. The connection URL format might vary depending on the driver, and different database vendors typically provide different drivers.

. Click the *Test Connection* button to show the connection test status.
+
[NOTE]
====
Using the *Test Connection* feature is not a requirement, however it is best practice that you use it to check the data source parameters prior to completing the data source creation.
====

You can modify the data source configuration parameters in the *Data Source Definition* editor by clicking the data source in the list under *Data Sources* in the *DataSource Explorer*.

ifdef::BPMS[]
If you want the Dashboard to use the new data source, you must also modify the respective data providers ({PRODUCT_BPMS} Count Processes, {PRODUCT_BPMS} Process Summary, {PRODUCT_BPMS} Task Summary). Note that the data source must have access to {PRODUCT_BPMS} history.
endif::BPMS[]


[id='_data-source-browser_con']
=== Data Source Content Browser

To access the data source content browser:

. Open the *DataSource Explorer* by clicking *Settings* image:settings-button.png[Settings button] -> *Data Sources*.
. Select a data source from the list under *Data Sources*.
. Click the *Browse Content* button in the *Data Source Definition* editor.
+
image:data-source-editor.png[Data Source Definition]

The content browser allows you to navigate through the structure of the data source target database. This navigation is performed at three levels:

Schemas level:: This level lists all the database schemas accessible by the selected data source. The list of schemas displayed is based on the database access rights of the user as defined in the connection configuration. This also applies to the selected schema level.
Current schema level:: This level shows all database tables for the selected schema.
Current table level:: This level shows the table content for the selected table.

In the data source content browser, clicking the *Open* button opens the next level for each item.


[id='_external-data-sources_con']
=== External Data Sources


External data sources exist in the current container and are not typically defined in the current workbench. For some containers, such as Wildfly 11 or {EAP} 7 servers, they can be listed in read-only mode. In this case, only the data source content browser is enabled, and you cannot edit any configuration parameters using the *Data Source Definition* editor.


For example:
image:example-data-source.png[ExampleDS]

[IMPORTANT]
====
When creating an external data source using *DataSource Explorer*, the data source needs to use the local connection so that the user can be passed through.
Otherwise, with a connection that uses <host>:<port>, every user would have the same virtual database (VDB) permissions.
====

[id='_database-drivers_con']
=== Database Drivers

In order to communicate with the target database, a data source requires a database driver. You can add and configure database drivers in the *DataSource Explorer* perspective. A database driver is a JDBC-compliant driver.


{PRODUCT} includes the following default drivers. These drivers are configured for the most commonly used open source databases and aligned with the latest database versions supported by the Wildfly 11 and {EAP} 7 servers:

* MariaDB-1.3.4
* MySQL-5.1.38
* PostgreSQL-9.4.1207

[id='_adding-datasource-driver_task']
=== Adding a New Driver

You can add a new driver in the *DataSource Explorer* perspective. To access this perspective, click image:settings-button.png[Settings button] -> *Data Sources*.

.Procedure

. Under the *Drivers* menu, click image:add-driver.png[Add Driver] to open the *New driver* wizard.
. Enter the following required parameters:

* *Name*: A unique name for the driver definition.
* *Driver Class Name*: The fully-qualified Java name for the class that implements the JDBC driver contract.
* *Group Id*: The Maven group ID for the artifact that contains the JDBC driver implementation.
* *Artifact Id*: The Maven artifact ID for the artifact that contains the JDBC driver implementation.
* *Version*: The Maven version for the artifact that contains the JDBC driver implementation.

. Click *Finish*.

Some commercial database drivers are not available in the Maven central repository. To use commercial drivers, upload them with the *Artifact Repository* perspective and then continue with the driver configuration process, similar to other drivers available in the Maven central repository.

To modify the driver configuration parameters in the *Driver Definition* editor, click the driver in the list under *Drivers* in the *DataSource Explorer*.

[id='_building_a_dashboard_for_large_volumes_of_data']
== Building a Dashboard for Large Volumes of Data

You can connect Red Hat JBoss Dashboard Builder to external databases and load data for generating reports and charts. Generally, if the volume of data is small (up to 2MB), Red Hat JBoss Dashboard Builder preloads the data into (local) memory and uses this data for report and chart generation.
However, in case of large volumes of data, it is not possible to load the entire data set into the Dashboard Builder's local memory.

Based on the volume of data you are dealing with, you can choose to query the database to build a dashboard report in any one of the following strategies:

* The in-memory strategy
+
The in-memory strategy is to create a data provider that loads all the required data from the database by executing a single SQL query on the relevant tables, into the Dashboard Builder's memory.
In this case, every indicator on the Dashboard Builder shares the same data set.
When you use filters from the Dashboard Builder user interface to access specific data from this data set, the Dashboard Builder fetches the data from the internal memory and does not execute another SQL query again on the database.
This strategy has a simple data retrieval logic as it deals with creating a single data provider.
As all the data set properties are available to you at once, it allows you to configure KPIs faster.
However, this approach is not suitable for large data sets as it would lead to poor performance.
+
* The native strategy
+
The native approach is to create a data provider for every indicator in the Dashboard Builder and does not require loading all the data into the internal memory at once.
So each time you use a filter from the Dashboard Builder user interface, the corresponding SQL queries get executed and fetches the required data from the database.
So there is no data in the Dashboard Builder's internal memory.
This strategy works best in case of large volumes of data, however it needs proper indexing on the database tables.
Also, setting up data providers for multiple KPIs is complicated as compared to creating a single data provider in case of in-memory strategy.


.Example
Let us consider a case when you want to create a stock exchange dashboard comprising the following charts and reports:

* Bar chart for Average price per company
* Area chart for Sales price evolution
* Pie chart for Companies per country
* Table report for Stock prices at closing date


For these charts and reports, let us assume that the Dashboard Builder accesses data from the following tables:

* Company: Comprising columns ID, NAME, and COUNTRY.
* Stock: Comprising columns ID, ID_COMPANY, PRICE_PER_SHARE, and CLOSING_DATE.


For the in-memory strategy of building a dashboard, the following SQL query fetches all the required data from these two tables:

[source]
----
SELECT C.NAME, C.COUNTRY, S.PRICE_PER_SHARE, S.CLOSING_DATE
  FROM COMPANY C JOIN STOCK S ON (C.ID=S.ID_COMPANY)
----

The output of this query is saved in the Dashboard Builder's local memory.
The Dashboard accesses this data every time a filter is run.

On the other hand, if you are using the native strategy for huge volumes of data, an SQL query is executed on every filter request made by the Dashboard Builder and corresponding data is fetched from the database.
In this case here is how each filter accesses the database:

* For the bar chart on __Average price per company__, the following SQL query is executed:
+

[source]
----
SELECT C.NAME, AVG(S.PRICE_PER_SHARE)
  FROM COMPANY C JOIN STOCK S ON (C.ID=S.ID_COMPANY)
  WHERE {sql_condition, optional, c.country, country}
  AND {sql_condition, optional, c.name, name}
  GROUP BY C.NAME
----
* For the area chart on __Sales price evolution__, the following SQL query is executed:
+

[source]
----
SELECT S.CLOSING_DATE, AVG(S.PRICE_PER_SHARE)
  FROM COMPANY C JOIN STOCK S ON (C.ID=S.ID_COMPANY)
  WHERE {sql_condition, optional, c.country, country}
  AND {sql_condition, optional, c.name, name}
  GROUP BY CLOSING_DATE
----
* For the pie chart on __Companies per country__, the following SQL query is executed:
+

[source]
----
SELECT COUNTRY, COUNT(ID)
  FROM COMPANY
  WHERE {sql_condition, optional, country, country}
  AND {sql_condition, optional, name, name}
  GROUP BY COUNTRY
----
* For the table report on __Stock prices at closing date__, the following SQL query is executed:
+

[source]
----
SELECT C.NAME, C.COUNTRY, S.PRICE_PER_SHARE, S.CLOSING_DATE
  FROM COMPANY C JOIN STOCK S ON (C.ID=S.ID_COMPANY)
  WHERE {sql_condition, optional, c.country, country}
  AND {sql_condition, optional, c.name, name}
----


For each of these queries, you need to create a separate SQL data provider.

In the examples above, each KPI delegates the filter and group by operations to the database through the `{sql_condition}` clauses.
The signature of the `{sql_condition}` clause is the following:
[source]
----
  {sql_condition, [optional | required], [db column], [filter property]}
----
Here,

* optional: This indicates that if there is no filter for the given property, then the condition is ignored.
* required: This indicates that if there is no filter for the given property, then the SQL returns no data.
* db column: This indicates the database column where the current filter is applied.
* filter property: This indicates the selected UI filter property.


When a filter occurs in the UI, the Dashboard Builder parses and injects all the SQL data providers referenced by the KPIs into these SQL statements.
Every time a filter occurs in the UI, the Dashboard Builder gets all the SQL data providers referenced by the KPIs and injects the current filter selections made by the user into these SQLs.
