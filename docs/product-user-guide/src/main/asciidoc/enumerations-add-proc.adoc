= Adding Enumerations

You can add data enumerations to your package that can be used in other assets in your project. This expands the options that are presented in drop-down menus or fields configured in guided rules, guided decision tables, and other assets.

.Procedure
. Go to *Menu* -> *Design* -> *Projects* and click the project name.
. Click *Add Asset* -> *Enumeration*.
+
The enumeration file appears in your *Project Explorer*.
. Use the enumeration editor to add a *Fact*, *Field*, and *Context* for each enumeration entry.
+
The contents of an enumeration configuration are the mapping of a `fact.field` to a list of values. The list can either be literal or use a utility class (which must be added to the classpath) to load the strings. The strings contain either a value to be shown in the drop-down menu or a mapping from the code value (which is what is used in the rule) and a display value (for example, M=Mini).
+
Consider the following example enumeration:
+
[source]
----
'Board.type' : [ 'Short', 'Long', 'M=Mini', 'Boogie']
'Person.age' : [ '20', '25', '30', '35' ]
----
+
In this example, you would define the following in the enumeration editor:
+
.Example Enumeration

+
You can also configure more advanced enumerations with multiple data types. For example, a fact model for insurance policies could have a class called `Insurance`, consisting of the fields `policyType` and `coverage`. The choices for `policyType` could be `Home` or `Car`. The type of insurance policy will determine the type of coverage that will be available. A home insurance policy could include `property` or `liability`. A car insurance policy could include `collision` or `fullCoverage`. The `policyType` determines which options will be presented for coverage.
+
This would be expressed in the following example enumeration:
+
[source]
----
 'Insurance.policyType' : ['Home', 'Car']
 'Insurance.coverage[policyType=Home]' : ['property', 'liability']
 'Insurance.coverage[policyType=Car]' : ['collision', 'fullCoverage']
----
