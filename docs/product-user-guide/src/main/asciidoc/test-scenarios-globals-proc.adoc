= Using Globals
Globals are named objects that are visible to the rule engine but are different from the objects for facts. Accordingly, the changes in the object of a global do not trigger the re-evaluation of rules. You can use and validate global fields in a test scenario.

.Procedure
. Go to *Authoring* -> *Project Authoring* and select your project.
. Click *Create New Asset* -> *Global Variable(s)* to create a global definition.
. Define your global variable name and type.
. Go to your test scenario, click *Data Objects* -> *New item* to import the object type for your global in your test. If you do not import the type of your global variable, the variable will not be accessible for your test.
. In the *Editor* tab, click image:6176.png[] next to the *(globals)* label, select the global, and click *Add*.

Adding restrictions on fields is similar to adding fields and restrictions in the *GIVEN* section. For details, see <<test_scenarios_advanced_proc>>.
