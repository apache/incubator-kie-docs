= Using Globals
Globals are named objects that are visible to the rule engine but are different from the objects for facts. Accordingly, the changes in the object of a global do not trigger the re-evaluation of rules. You can use and validate global fields in a test scenario.

.Procedure
. Go to *Menu* -> *Design* -> *Projects* and click the project name.

. Go to your test scenario, click *Data Objects* -> *New item* to import the object type for your global in your test. If you do not import the type of your global variable, the variable will not be accessible for your test.
