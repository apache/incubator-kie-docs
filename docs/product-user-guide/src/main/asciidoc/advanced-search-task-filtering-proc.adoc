* Access the *Task List* perspective by selecting *Menu* -> *Track* -> *Task Lists*. It displays a list of your related tasks.
* Access the *Tasks Administration List* by clicking *Menu* -> *Manage* -> *Tasks Administration*. It provides a full list of tasks across all processes.
+
The *Task Administration List* is only available to administrators and process administrators.

Tasks can be filtered on the following attributes:

Id:: Filter by process instance ID.
+
Input: `Numeric`

Task:: Filter by task name.
+
Input: `String`

Correlation key:: Filter by correlation key. For more information about correlation keys, see the {URL_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE}[{DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE}].
+
Input: `String`

Actual Owner:: Filter by the task owner.
+
The actual owner refers to the user responsible for executing the task. The search is based on  user ID, which is a unique value and depends on the ID management system.
+
Input: `String`

Process Instance Description:: Filter by process instance description.
+
Input: `String`

Status:: Filter by task status. Only one status filter can be applied to the search results at a time. Selecting a different status overwrites the current status filter. Removing the status filter displays all processes, regardless of status.
+
In the *Task List* page, *Active*, *Personal*, *Group*, and *All* tabs display a list of all tasks with these statuses, however the filtering cannot be performed on these tabs. The following filter states are available:
+
** Completed
** Created
** Error
** Exited
** Failed
** InProgress
** Obsolete
** Ready
** Reserved
** Suspended

Process Name:: Filter by process name.

Created On:: Filtering by date or time.
+
This filter has the following quick filter options:

** Last Hour
** Today
** Last 24 Hours
** Last 7 Days
** Last 30 Days
** Custom
+
Selecting *Custom* date and time filtering opens a calendar tool for selecting a date and time range.
