= Tasks List

A User Task represents a piece of work the given user can claim and perform.
User Tasks can be handled within the *Tasks* page of the {CENTRAL}: the view displays the Task List for the given user.
You can think about it as a to-do item.
The User Task appears in your list because the User Task element generated the User Task.

A User Task can be assigned to a particular actor, multiple actors, or to a group of actors.
If assigned to multiple actors or a group of actors, it is visible in the Task Lists of all the actors and any of the possible actors can claim the task and execute it.
The moment the Task is claimed by one actor, it disappears from the Task List of other actors.
