= Additional rule attributes for RuleSet or RuleTable definitions

The `RuleSet` and `RuleTable` areas also support labels and values for other rule attributes, such as `PRIORITY` or `NO-LOOP`. Rule attributes specified in a `RuleSet` area will affect all rule assets in the same package (not only in the spreadsheet). Rule attributes specified in a `RuleTable` area will affect only the rules in that rule table. You can use each rule attribute only once in a `RuleSet` area and once in a `RuleTable` area. If the same attribute is used in both `RuleSet` and `RuleTable` areas within the spreadsheet, then `RuleTable` takes priority and the attribute in the `RuleSet` area is overridden.

*<@Michael (5 of 5): A recurring ambiguity all over this doc (you'll see it). In a decision table, you have one RuleSet and any number of RuleTables. What's in the RuleSet applies to all RuleTables within that spreadsheet AND to all other RuleTables in all other uploaded spreadsheets in the entire package? We say multiple times that the RuleSet in the the decision table defines rule attributes for all RuleTables in the whole _package_, not just for all RuleTables in the spreadsheet. So, does that mean you can basically only have one uploaded spreadsheet per package, with all RuleTables in it, since there can only be one RuleSet? Or are we saying you can have as many uploaded decision table spreadsheets as you like in a package, but each one must have the same RuleSet name, definitions, etc.? If that's the case, then we should probably be telling users to just put all RuleTables for the whole package in the same single spreadsheet, with it's single corresponding RuleSet there identified. Right?>*

The following table lists the supported labels (column headers) and values for additional `RuleSet` or `RuleTable` definitions. For column headers, you can use either the given labels or any custom labels that begin with the letters listed in the table.

.Additional rule attributes for `RuleSet` or `RuleTable` definitions
[cols="30%,15%,55%", options="header"]
|===
|Label
|Or custom label that begins with
|Value

|`PRIORITY`
|P
|An integer defining the `salience` value for the rule. Overridden by the `Sequential` flag.

|`DURATION`
|D
|A long integer value defining the `duration` value for the rule.

|`TIMER`
|T
|Either interval (`int`) or cron (`cron`) timer definition for scheduling jobs.

|`CALENDARS`
|E
|A Quartz calendar definition.

|`NO-LOOP`
|U
|A Boolean value. `true` inhibits looping of rules due to changes made by its consequence.

|`LOCK-ON-ACTIVE`
|L
|A Boolean value. `true` inhibits additional activations of all rules with this flag set within the same ruleflow or agenda group.

|`AUTO-FOCUS`
|F
|A Boolean value. `true` for a rule within an agenda group causes activations of the rule to automatically give the focus to the group.

|`ACTIVATION-GROUP`
|X
|A string identifying an activation (or XOR) group. Only one rule within an activation group will fire, that is, the first one to fire cancels any existing activations of other rules within the same group.

|`AGENDA-GROUP`
|G
|A string identifying an agenda group, which has to be activated by giving it the `focus`, which is one way of controlling the flow between groups of rules.

|`RULEFLOW-GROUP`
|R
|A string identifying a rule-flow group.

|`DATE-EFFECTIVE`
|V
|A string containing a date and time definition. A rule can be activated only if the current date and time is after a `DATE-EFFECTIVE` attribute.

|`DATE-EXPIRES`
|Z
|A string containing a date and time definition. A rule cannot be activated if the current date and time is after the `DATE-EXPIRES` attribute.
