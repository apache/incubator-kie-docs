= Defining KIE Bases and Sessions

A _KIE base_ is a repository of the application's knowledge definitions. It contains rules, processes, functions, and type models. A KIE base does not contain runtime data, instead sessions are created from the KIE base into which data can be inserted and process instances started.

A _KIE session_ stores runtime data created from a KIE base. For more information, see {URL_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE}#sect_kie_sessions[KIE Sessions] of the _{DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE}_.

You can create KIE bases and sessions by editing the `kmodule.xml` file in either the *Project View* or in the *Repository View* of a project in Business Central.
