= Decision tables
A decision table is a visual representation of one or more rules in a tabular format.  Each rule consists of a single row in the table, and includes columns that define the conditions and outcome for that particular row.  The definition of each row is precise enough to derive the outcome using the values of the conditions.  For readability purposes, there is often a means to hide some of the more technical details when viewing the table.

Decision tables are a popular technique for modeling rules and decisions, and are used in many methodologies (such as DMN) and implementation frameworks (such as Drools used in {Product}). Although the concept of decision tables are the same in DMN and Drools, the implementations are not fully exchangeable in practice.

This section explores the DMN implementation of decision tables. For more information about Drools decision tables, see {URL_GUIDED_DECISION_TABLES}[{GUIDED_DECISION_TABLES}].

== Hit policies
Hit policies define how to reach an outcome when multiple rules apply to a single situation. Decision modelers select one of the following five methods for reaching an outcome and then specify that method by placing an indicator in the tableâ€™s upper-left corner. In the following list, the indicators are listed after the indicator type, in parentheses ().

* *Unique (U):* Permits only one rule to match. Any overlap represents an error.
* *Any (A):* Permits rules with identical output values to overlap. Rules with differing output values create inconsistencies in the table, creating an error.
* *Priority (P):* Permits overlapping rules with different output values only if the hit policy establishes a priority order in the table output column heading. Priority tables that omit valid outputs are in error.
* *First (F):* Uses the first acceptable rule, based on the listed order of rules.
* *Collect (C+, C>, C<, C#):* Aggregates output from multiple rules based on an aggregation code.
** *Collect ( C ):* Aggregates values in an arbitrary list.
** *Collect Sum (C+):* Outputs the sum of all collected values. Values must be numeric.
** *Collect Min (C<):* Outputs the smallest numeric value.
** *Collect Max (C>):* Outputs the largest numeric value.
** *Collect Count (C#):* Outputs the number of matching rules.
