= Inserting an `any other` value in condition column cells

For simple condition columns in guided decision tables, you can apply an `any other` value to table cells within the column if the following parameters are set:

* *Calculation type* for the condition column has been set to `Literal value`.
* *Operator* has been set as equality `==` or inequality `!=`.

The `any other` value enables a rule to be defined for any other field values not explicitly defined in the rules already in the table.

Example:

[source,java]
----
when
  IncomeSource( type not in ("Asset", "Job") )
  ...
then
  ...
end
----

.Procedure

. Select a cell of a condition column that uses the `==` or `!=` operator.
. In the upper-right toolbar of the table designer, click *Edit* -> *Insert "any other" value*.
