The Data Modeler is the built-in editor for creating facts or data objects as part of a Project data model from Business Central (in the *Data Objects* panel of your Project Explorer). These custom data types can be then used in any resource (such as a Guided Decision Table) after they have been imported.

The Data Modeler supports roundtrips between the `Editor` and `Source` tabs, along with source code preservation.
This allows you to make changes to your model in external tools, like JBDS, and the Data Modeler updates the necessary code blocks automatically.

In the main editor window, you can perform these actions:

* Add or delete fields.
* Select a given field. When you select a field, the field information will be loaded in all the domain editors.

* Select the data object class. For example, if you click the data object name (on the main window) instead of loading the field properties, the domain editors will load the class properties.
