= Entando DXP Platform and App Builder

Entando Digital Experience (DXP) Platform is a low-code, component-based platform for building modern web, mobile, and IoT applications. The Entando App Builder is the application that provides features to help you configure and customize, with or without programming skills, any kind of modern web application built with the Entando Platform. The App Builder is a ReactJS-based application that uses REST APIs to communicate with Entando Core and any third-party plugins. The App Builder includes an Admin Console that you can use to build and configure your web application, manage your page data and activities, and integrate with other application tools, such as {PRODUCT}.

The basic components for building applications in Entando are page models that define page layout and application widgets that define page data and functionality.
