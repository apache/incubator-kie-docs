= Defining decision tables

There are two types of rectangular areas defining data that is used for generating a DRL file.
One, marked by a cell labelled ``RuleSet``, defines all DRL items except rules.
The other one may occur repeatedly and is to the right and below a cell whose contents begin with ``RuleTable``.
These areas represent the actual decision tables, each area resulting in a set of rules of similar structure.

A Rule Set area may contain cell pairs, one below the `RuleSet` cell and containing a keyword designating the kind of value contained in the other one that follows in the same row.

The columns of a Rule Table area define patterns and constraints for the left hand sides of the rules derived from it, actions for the consequences of the rules, and the values of individual rule attributes.
Thus, a Rule Table area should contain one or more columns, both for conditions and actions, and an arbitrary selection of columns for rule attributes, at most one column for each of these.
The first four rows following the row with the cell marked with `RuleTable` are earmarked as header area, mostly used for the definition of code to construct the rules.
It is any additional row below these four header rows that spawns another rule, with its data providing for variations in the code defined in the Rule Table header.

All keywords are case insensitive.

Only the first worksheet is examined for decision tables.
