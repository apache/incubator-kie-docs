= Defining decision tables

Decision table spreadsheets require two key areas that define rule data: a `RuleSet` area and a `RuleTable` area. The `RuleSet` area of the spreadsheet defines elements that you want to apply globally to all rule tables in the package, such as a rule set name or universal rule attributes. The `RuleTable` area defines the actual rules (rows) and the conditions, actions, and other rule attributes (columns) that constitute that rule table, within the specified rule set. A decision table spreadsheet can contain multiple `RuleTable` areas, but only one `RuleSet` area.

Refer to the following sample spreadsheet as you define your decision table:

.Procedure
. In a new XLS spreadsheet, go to the second or third column and label a cell `RuleSet` (row 9 in example). Reserve the column or columns to the left for descriptive metadata (optional).
. In the next cell to the right, enter a name for the `RuleSet`. This named rule set will contain all `RuleTable` rules defined in the rule package.
. Under the `RuleSet` cell, list any rule attributes (one per cell) that you want to apply globally to all rule tables in the package. Specify attribute values in the cells to the right. For a list of attributes and expected values, see xref:decision-tables-rule-set-entries-ref[].
. Below the the `RuleSet` area, skip a row and in the same column as the `RuleSet` cell, label a new cell `RuleTable` (row 13 in example) and enter a table name in the same cell or in the cell to the right.
. Use the next four rows to define the following elements as needed (rows 14-17 in example):
+
* *Rule attributes:* Conditions, actions, or other attributes. For a list of attributes, see xref:decision-tables-rule-table-entries-ref[].
* *Object types:* (Optional) The data objects to which the rule attributes apply. If the same object type applies to multiple columns, merge the object cells into one cell across multiple columns, instead of repeating the object type in multiple cells. When an object type is merged, all columns below the merged range will be combined into one set of constraints within a single pattern for matching a single fact at a time. When an object is repeated in separate columns, the separate columns can create different patterns, potentially matching different or identical facts.
* *Constraints:* (Optional) Constraints on the object types, if specified.
* *Column label:* (Optional) Any descriptive label for the column, as a visual aid.
+
. After you have defined all necessary rule attributes (columns), enter values for each column as needed, row by row, to generate rules (rows 18 and 19 in example). Cells with no data are ignored (such as when a condition or action does not apply).
+
If you need to add more rule tables to this decision table spreadsheet, skip a row after the last rule in the previous table, label another `RuleTable` cell in the same column as the previous `RuleTable` and  `RuleSet` cells, and create the new table following the same steps in this section.
+
. Save your XLS spreadsheet to finish.




The keywords `RuleSet` and `RuleTable` in decision tables are not case sensitive.




Decision table spreadsheets require two key areas that define rule data: a `RuleSet` area and a `RuleTable` area. Use the `RuleSet` area of the spreadsheet to specify a name for the entire rule package, and to provide any rule attributes that you want to apply globally to all rule tables in the package. Use the `RuleTable` area to define conditions, actions, and other rule attributes (columns) and the rules (rows) for that rule table. The keywords `RuleSet` and `RuleTable` in decision tables are not case sensitive.

Although attributes in the `RuleSet` area are applied to all rule tables in the entire package, attributes that you define within the `RuleTable` area are applied only to that rule table.

Only the first worksheet in a spreadsheet workbook will be processed as a decision table when you upload the spreadsheet in {CENTRAL}. The `RuleTable` name combined with the sheet name must be unique across all decision table files in the same package.
