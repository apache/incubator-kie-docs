= Adding Annotations in the Data Modeler

You can switch to the *Source* tab of the Data Modeler and modify the source code and annotations directly. However, as a more secure and guided method for adding standard annotations, you can also use the *Advanced* option at the right side of the Data Modeler.

For more information about this and other annotation options, see <<data_object_domain_screens_con>>.

.Procedure

. Select the *Advanced* Domain Screen option on the right side of the Data Modeler, and click *add annotation*.
