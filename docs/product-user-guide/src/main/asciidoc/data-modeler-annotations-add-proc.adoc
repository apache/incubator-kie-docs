= Adding Annotations in the Data Modeler

You can switch to the *Source* tab of the Data Modeler and modify the source code and annotations directly. However, as a more secure and guided method for adding standard annotations, you can also use the *Advanced* option at the right side of the Data Modeler.

For more information about annotation options, see <<data_object_domain_screens_con>>.

[NOTE]
====
When adding an annotation in the Data Modeler, ensure that the annotation class is on the workbench classpath. If not, a project dependency can be added to a `.jar` file that has the annotation. The Data Modeler runs a validation check to confirm that the annotation is on the classpath, and the project will not build if the annotation is not present.
