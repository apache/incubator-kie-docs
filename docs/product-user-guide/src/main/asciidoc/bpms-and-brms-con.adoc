[[_bpms_and_brms_con]]
= {PRODUCT_BPMS} and {PRODUCT_BRMS}

{PRODUCT_BPMS} comes with integrated {PRODUCT_BRMS}, a rule engine and rule tooling, so you can define rules governing processes or tasks.
Based on a Business Rule Task call, the Process Engine calls the Rule Engine to evaluate the rule based on specific data from the process instance.
If the defined rule condition is met, the action defined by the rule is taken.

For more information, see <<_business_rule_task>> in this guide, and the {PRODUCT_BRMS} documentation.
