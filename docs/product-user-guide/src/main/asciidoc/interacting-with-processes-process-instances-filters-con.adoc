= Process instance filtering in {CENTRAL}

{Central} now provides you with basic and advanced filters to help you filter and search through process instances. You can filter processes by attributes such as *State*, *Errors*, *Filter By*, *Name*, *Start Date*, and *Last update*. You can also create custom filters using the *Advanced Filters* option. The newly created custom filter is added to the *Saved Filters* pane, which is accessible by clicking on the star icon on the left of the *Manage Process Instances* page.

[NOTE]
====
All users except those with `manager` or `rest-all` roles can access and filter process instances in {CENTRAL}.
