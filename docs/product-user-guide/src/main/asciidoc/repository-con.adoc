= Creating a Repository

All business assets are stored in repositories associated with teams. By default, the main Business Central *Artifact repository* does not contain any team. Therefore, to be able to create your own business assets, you need to create a repository within a team that you have defined.

You can create an individual repository for a team in three ways:

* In the Business Central user interface
////
* With the `kie-config-cli` tool
// Commented out for LA, per BXMSDOC-1797.
////
* With Knowledge Store REST API calls
