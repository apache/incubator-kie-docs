= Creating a Repository

All business assets are stored in repositories associated with organizational units. By default, the main Business Central *Artifact repository* does not contain any organizational unit. Therefore, to be able to create your own business assets, you need to create a repository within an organizational unit that you have defined.

You can create an individual repository for an organizational unit in three ways:

* In the Business Central user interface
* With the `kie-config-cli` tool
* With Knowledge Store REST API calls
