.Procedure
. Navigate to http://localhost:8080/business-central in a web browser. If the user interface has been configured to run from a domain name, substitute `localhost` for the domain name. For example http://www.example.com:8080/business-central
. Enter the user credentials that you created during installation. For example: User = `helloworlduser` and password = ``Helloworld@123``.

If the web page is not found or fails to load, check your command line interface to ensure that the {EAP} has finished running successfully, then try to log in again. If the problem persists, ensure that the login credentials match those that you created during installation.
