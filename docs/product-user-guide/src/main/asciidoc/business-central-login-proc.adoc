.Procedure
. In a terminal application, navigate to `__EAP_HOME__/bin`.
. Run the standalone configuration:
** On Linux or Unix-based systems:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ ./standalone.sh
----
** On Windows:
+
[source,bash]
----
standalone.bat
----
. In a web browser, open the URL `localhost:8080/business-central`. If the user interface has been configured to run from a domain name, substitute `localhost` for the domain name, for example:
+
http://www.example.com:8080/business-central

. Enter the user credentials that you created during installation. For example, enter the user name
ifdef::BA[]
`bpmsAdmin`
endif::[]
ifdef::DM[]
`brmsAdmin`
endif::[]
and the password `password@1`.

If the web page is not found or fails to load, check your command line interface to ensure that the {EAP} has finished running successfully, then try to log in again. If the problem persists, ensure that the login credentials match those that you created during installation.
