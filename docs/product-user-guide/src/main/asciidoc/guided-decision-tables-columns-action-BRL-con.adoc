= "Add an Action BRL fragment"

A Business Rule Language (BRL) fragment is a section of a rule created using the guided rule designer. The xref:guided-decision-tables-columns-condition-BRL-con[condition BRL fragment] is the "WHEN" portion of the rule, and the action BRL fragment is the "THEN" portion of the rule. With this column option you can define an action BRL fragment to be used in the right ("THEN") side of a rule. Any *Template key* field values (as opposed to *Literal* or *Formula* values) that you add to conditions (example: `$rate`) form separate columns in the decision table. Simpler column types can refer to Facts and Fact fields bound in the BRL fragment and vice-versa.
