Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite comes with a project with assets examples to demonstrate the possible usage and capabilities of the product.

Also, the project contains Junit tests for each Element, which are simple working examples. These test processes can serve as simple examples. The entire list can be found in the src/test/resources folder for the jbpm-bpmn2 module. Note that each of the processes is accompanied by a junit test that tests the implementation of the construct.
