= Milestones

Case management milestones usually occurs at the end of a stage, but can also be the result of reaching other milestones. A milestone represents an achievement within the case instance, and can be used to flag certain progress, which can be valuable for KPI tracking.

* Milestones define which conditions are required to be met before the milestone is achieved.
* Milestones react to case file data.
* Milestones can be triggered as many times as needed.
