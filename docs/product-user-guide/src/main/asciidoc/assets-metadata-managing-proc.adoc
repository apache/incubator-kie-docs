.Procedure

. Go to *Menu* -> *Design* -> *Projects* and select your project.
. Select the asset from the list to open the asset editor in the *Project Explorer*.
. In the asset editor window, select *Overview*. If an asset doesn't have an *Overview* tab, then no metadata is associated with that asset.
