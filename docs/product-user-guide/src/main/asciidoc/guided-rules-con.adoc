Guided rules are business rules that you create in a UI-based guided rules designer in {CENTRAL} that leads you through the rule creation process. The guided rule designer provides fields and options for acceptable input based on the data objects for the rule being defined.

All data objects related to the rule must be in the same project package as the rule. Assets in the same package are imported by default. You can use the *Data Objects* tab of the rule designer to verify that all required data objects are listed or to import any other needed data objects by adding a *New item*. For information about creating new data objects to be used in your rules, see xref:data-objects-con_guided-rules[].

//The guided rule designer also enables you to leverage planner-specific functionality. For details about the Guided Rule Editor planning capabilities, see the _{URL_PLANNER_GUIDE}[{PLANNER}] Guide_.
