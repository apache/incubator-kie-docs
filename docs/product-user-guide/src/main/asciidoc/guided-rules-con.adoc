Guided rules are business rules that you create in a UI-based guided rules designer in {CENTRAL} that leads you through the rule creation process. The guided rule designer provides fields and options for acceptable input based on the data objects for the rule being defined.

All data objects related to a guided rule must be in the same project package as the guided rule. Assets in the same package are imported by default. After the necessary data objects and the guided rule are created, you can use the *Data Objects* tab of the guided rule designer to verify that all required data objects are listed or to import other existing data objects by adding a *New item*.

//The guided rule designer also enables you to leverage planner-specific functionality. For details about the Guided Rule Editor planning capabilities, see the _{URL_PLANNER_GUIDE}[{PLANNER}] Guide_.
