= Case File

A case file used in case management as a repository of data for the entire case instance. It contains all roles, milestones, the object itself, the data map, and any other data. The case can be closed and reopened at a later date with the same case file attached. The case file can be closed at any time, however it must have a specific resolution attached to it in order to be “completed”.
 
Importantly, case files can also store comments and communications for all roles attached to the case. It can include documentation in the form of embedded documentation, references, PDF attachments, web links, and so on.
