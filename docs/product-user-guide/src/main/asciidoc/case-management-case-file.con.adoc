= Case file

A case file is used in case management as a repository of data for the entire case instance. It contains all roles, the object itself, the data map, and any other data. The case can be closed and reopened at a later date with the same case file attached. A case instance can be closed at any time and does not require a specific resolution in order to be “completed”. The case instance can be reopened at a later date with the same case file referenced.
 
Importantly, the case file can also include documentation in the form of embedded documentation, references, PDF attachments, web links, and so on.
