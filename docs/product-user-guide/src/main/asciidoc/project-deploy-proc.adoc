The building process time varies based on the size of the project. Build errors are displayed at the bottom of the page. Click *Messages* (top-right) for details.

. When the build is complete, go to *Menu* -> *Track* -> *Process and Task Reports* to view the updated list of built artifacts.
. Click *Download* next to the artifact to download the deployable JAR file.

[NOTE]
====
Deployment units are stored inside the database not in the GIT repository.
To override this behavior, set the [property]``org.kie.git.deployments.enabled`` property to true.
