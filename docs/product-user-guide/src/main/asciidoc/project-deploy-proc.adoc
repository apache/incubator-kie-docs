= Building and Deploying a Project

When your project contains all necessary assets and is ready for deployment, you can build the project and download a deployable file from Business Central.

.Procedure
. In Business Central, click *Menu* -> *Projects* -> and click on the project name. For example, *Evaluation*.
. In the upper-right corner of the screen, click *Build and Deploy*.

The building process time varies based on the size of the project. Build errors are displayed at the bottom of the page. Click *Messages* (top-right) for details.

. When the build is complete, go to *Menu* -> *Track* -> *Process and Task Reports* to view the updated list of built artifacts.
. Click *Download* next to the artifact to download the deployable JAR file.

[NOTE]
====
Deployment units are stored inside the database not in the GIT repository.
To override this behavior, set the [property]``org.kie.git.deployments.enabled`` property to true.

5.7. In the final NOTE - Throughout our docs we state 'set the x.x.x.x property ' to override something. But it is never clear where or how! Perhaps this is stated somewhere in the intro of the docs. In this particular case it is in the standalone.xml file for EAP/Wildfly server.
