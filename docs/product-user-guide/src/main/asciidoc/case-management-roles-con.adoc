= Case Roles

Case roles provide an additional layer of abstraction for user participation in case handling. Roles drive the authorization for the case instance, and can be used for user activities assignment. The only role that is predefined is `Owner`. A user, a group, or groups can be assigned to the owner role. The owner is whoever the case belongs to. This can be changed. Roles are not restricted to a single set of people or groups as part of case definition. 

Roles are optional, and not a case requirement, however, it is considered to be best practice to use roles within case definitions.
 
Role assignments can be given when the case starts or while it is active at any time, and can be changed at any point while the case instance is active. Case Management users should always assign roles to task assignments rather than actual user or group names. This allows the case to be as dynamic as possible, as actual user or group assignment can happen as late as possible, and can also be changed.
