= Definition of a knowledge worker user

Consider an example of a customer account representative processing mortgage loan requests at a financial institution. As a customer account representative, you will accept and decline mortgage requests, search and filter through requests, delegate, claim, and release requests, set due date and priority on requests, view and comment on requests, and view the request history log.
