= Other methods for creating DRL files

As an alternative to creating and managing DRL files within the {CENTRAL} interface, you can create DRL files externally using Red Hat Developer Studio, Java objects, or Maven archetypes. These DRL files can then be integrated with your {PRODUCT} decision service, so long as the external DRL files contain at minimum the required `package` specification, `import` lists, and `rule` definitions. Any other DRL components, such as global variables and functions, are optional. All data objects related to a DRL rule must be included with your external DRL project or deployment.

*<@Michael (10 of 13): I pulled the content in this chapter from all over our Dev Guide, cleaned them up, and added to them. A few general questions for you:>*

* *Is the above section correct?*
* *Do you know if the following sections still apply to {PRODUCT}?*
* *Do you think the following sections sufficiently document how each type of external DRL file is integrated with the {PRODUCT} decision service? I _think_ what's there is all that's required, but I'm left unsure what to say at the end of each section.*
* *How exactly are these external files "integrated" with {PRODUCT}, and can the user see them in {CENTRAL}? I ask you this at the end of each section. I see that each section explains how to import all the neede KIE base and KIE session stuff, etc., but I'm not sure what that means in the end. What should the user expect or do after following the steps in each section.*

*Basically, I still don't know enough about integrating external DRL files in general to be certain that these sections are accurate, complete, or to what extent they still apply. Help! :)*
