Planner leverages the <<data_modeler_con,Data Modeler>> to create domain model for constraint satisfaction problems.

In addition to the basic functionality the Data modeler provides (creating data objects and their properties),
the Workbench allows enhancing the data model with Planner-specific data object roles ({URL_BUSINESS_PLANNER_GUIDE}#solutionClass[Planning Solution], {URL_BUSINESS_PLANNER_GUIDE}[Planning Entity]) in a user-friendly way. The options are available in the Planner dock.

The content of the dock varies depending on the current selection. Selecting a data object results in displaying
top-level settings defined on data object level ({URL_BUSINESS_PLANNER_GUIDE}#solutionClass[Planning Solution], {URL_BUSINESS_PLANNER_GUIDE}#planningEntity[Planning Entity]).
On the other hand, selecting properties of the data object results in displaying fine-grained settings defined on property level of the data object.

The overview of the Planner dock capabilities is shown in the following division:

*Data object level*

* {URL_BUSINESS_PLANNER_GUIDE}#planningEntity[Planning Entity]
