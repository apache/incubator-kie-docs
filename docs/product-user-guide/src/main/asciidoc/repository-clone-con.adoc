= Cloning a Repository

Instead of creating a new repository, you can clone an existing one and associate it with your organizational unit.

You can clone an individual repository for an organizational unit in two ways:

* In the Business Central user interface
* With Knowledge Store REST API calls

You cannot use the `kie-config-cli` tool to clone repositories.
