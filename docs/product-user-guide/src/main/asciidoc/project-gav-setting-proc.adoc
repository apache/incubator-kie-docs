= Setting the Group ID, Artifact ID, and Version (GAV) values in a project

The GAV values identify the project in a Maven repository. If you build a new version of your project without changing the GAV values, the old version of the project is displaced in the Maven repository and on any {KIE_SERVERS}. However, if you change any value in the GAV (usually the version), the result is seen as a different artifact and can exist alongside the old version.

You can set the GAV values in the project *Settings* screen.

.Procedure

. Click the project *Settings* tab.
. In *General Settings*, modify the *Group ID*, *Artifact ID*, or *Version* fields as necessary. If you have deployed the project and are developing a new version, usually you need to increase the version number.
. Click *Save* to finish.
