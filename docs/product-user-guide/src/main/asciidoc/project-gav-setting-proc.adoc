= Setting the Group ID, Artifact ID, and Version (GAV) values in a project

The GAV values identify the project in a Maven repository. When {CENTRAL} and {KIE_SERVER} are on the same file system and use the same Maven repository, the project is updated in the repository each time you build a new version of your project. However, if {CENTRAL} and {KIE_SERVER} are on separate file systems and use separate local Maven repositories, then you must update a project GAV value, usually the version, for any new versions of the project to ensure that the project is seen as a different artifact alongside the old version.

You can set the GAV values in the project *Settings* screen.

.Procedure
. In {CENTRAL}, go to *Menu* -> *Design* -> *Projects* and click the project name.
+
Alternatively, click *Add Project* to create a new project.
. Click the project *Settings* tab.
. In *General Settings*, modify the *Group ID*, *Artifact ID*, or *Version* fields as necessary. If you have deployed the project and are developing a new version, usually you need to increase the version number.
. Click *Save* to finish.
