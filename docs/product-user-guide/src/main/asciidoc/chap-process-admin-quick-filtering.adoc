= Process Administration Advanced Search Filtering

{CENTRAL} allows you to search for process instances, tasks, jobs, and errors by applying filters to narrow down the list of results displayed in the *Search* tab of the relevant page.

All *Search* tabs use a single filter by default to show working results. The results can be filtered by adding additional filter attributes. New filters are added to existing filters, and the list of matching results displayed in the table update in real time. Filters can be removed at any time by clicking *Clear All* to remove all filters, or by clicking the close icon on the individual filter attribute you want to remove.

Filters applied while using the *Search* tab are cleared whenever you navigate to a different screen in {CENTRAL}, and cannot be saved for reuse. To create save a custom filter for reuse, use the image:plus_icon.png[] button at the end of the tabs list to create a new filtered list. For more information about creating custom filters, see <<_chap_deploying_projects>>.
