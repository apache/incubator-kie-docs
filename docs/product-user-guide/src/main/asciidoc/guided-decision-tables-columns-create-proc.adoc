= Adding columns to guided decision tables

After you have created the guided decision table, you can define and add various types of columns within the decision table editor.

.Prerequisite
All column-related data objects, such as Facts and Fields, have been created within the same package where the guided decision table is found, or have been imported from another package in *Data Objects* -> *New item* of the guided decision table editor. These objects and assets will be required for some of the parameters for adding columns to a guided decision table. For descriptions of these parameters, see the "Required Column Parameters" segments for each column type in <<guided-decision-tables-columns-types-con>>. For details about creating data objects, see **(expand content from data-objects-create-proc.adoc).

For descriptions of each column type and required parameters for setup, see <<guided-decision-tables-columns-types-con>>.
