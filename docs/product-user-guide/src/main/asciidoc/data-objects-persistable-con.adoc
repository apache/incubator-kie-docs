= Persistable Data Objects

Beginning in {PRODUCT} 6.2, the Data Modeler supports the generation of persistable data objects. Persistable data objects are based on the JPA specification. When you check the *Persistable* check box for a new or existing data object, the platform will use default persistence settings.
