Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite comes with a plug-in for Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio that provides support for development of business processes in the Eclipse-based environment, such as debugging and testing. It also provides a graphical Process Designer for business process editing.

The repository structure follows the maven structure described in xref:projects-con_chap-project[].

For instructions on how to install and set up the plug-in, see the _{DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE}_.

= Creating BPM Project

.Prerequisite
You must have Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio with both Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite and Red Hat JBoss BRMS plug-ins and runtime environments installed. For more information, see _{DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE}_.

To create a BPM project:

. In the Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio menu, click *File* -> *New* -> *Other...*.
. Click *jBPM* -> *jBPM project*.
. In the *Create New jBPM Project* dialog, select the required content and click *Next*.
. If you did not select a project with online examples, specify the project name, location, and type:
* `Java and jBPM Runtime classes`: select the runtime to be used by the project or click *Manage Runtime Definitions...* and define a new runtime (for details on runtime resources, see the _{DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE}_).
* `Maven`: specify maven properties of your project.

[id='_creating_process']
= Creating Process

In JBoss Developer Studio with the Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite plug-in, create a process the same way as other resources:

. Click *File* -> *New* -> *Other...*.
. Click *jBPM* -> *jBPM Process Diagram*.
. In the displayed dialog box, define the name, package, and container of the process. The rest of the fields complete automatically. Note that you must follow the Maven structure.

Once created, the process opens for editing in the graphical Process Designer.

[id='_checking_session_logs']
= Checking Session Logs

The audit log allows you to check the log of all events logged during the session. Audit log is an XML-based log file that contains a log of all the events that occurred while executing a specific KIE session.

.Procedure: Creating Logger
. To create a logger, use `KieServices` and attach the logger to a `ksession`, for example:
+
[source,java]
----
KieRuntimeLogger logger = KieServices.Factory.get().getLoggers().newThreadedFileLogger(ksession, "mylogfile", 1000);
// Do something with the ksession here.
logger.close();
----
. Close the logger when you have finished using it.

.Procedure: Using Audit View
. To use *Audit View*, click *Window* -> *Show View* -> *Other...*.
. Click the *Drools*, and click *Audit*.
. To open a log file in *Audit View*, select the log file using the *Open Log* action in the top right corner, or simply drag and drop the log file from the _Package Explorer_ or _Navigator_ into the _Audit View_.
. A tree-based view is generated based on the data inside the audit log. Depicted below is an example tree-based view:
+

. An event is shown as a subnode of another event if the child event is caused as a direct consequence of the parent event.

[NOTE]
.File-Based Logger
====
The file-based logger only saves the events on close or when a certain threshold is reached. If you want events to be saved at regular intervals (such as during debugging), use a threaded file logger so the audit view is updated to show the latest state. When creating a threaded file logger, you can specify the interval after which events should be saved to the file (in milliseconds).
