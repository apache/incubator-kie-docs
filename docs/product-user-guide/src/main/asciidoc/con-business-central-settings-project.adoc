= Projects

Use the Project perspective to enable or disable the GAV conflict check and allow or forbid child GAV editions. 

If you access the Project perspective from the Settings menu, any changes you make will apply to all projects, with the exception noted in the following paragraph.

The Project perspective is also available from each project through the *Preferences* button. If you access the Project perspective from within a project, the changes that you make apply only to that project and they override any changes that you make to the Project perspective accessed from the Settings menu.
