= Types of Notifications

The verification and validation feature uses three types of notifications:

* image:gdtValidationVerificationIconError.png[] Error: A serious problem that may lead to the guided decision table failing to work as designed at run time. Conflicts, for example, are reported as errors.
* image:gdtValidationVerificationIconWarning.png[] Warning: Likely a serious problem that may not prevent the guided decision table from working but requires attention. Subsumptions, for example, are reported as warnings.
* image:gdtValidationVerificationIconInfo.png[] Information: A moderate or minor problem that may not prevent the guided decision table from working but requires attention. Missing columns, for example, are reported as information.
