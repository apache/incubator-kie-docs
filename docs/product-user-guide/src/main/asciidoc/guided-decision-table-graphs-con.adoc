= Guided Decision Table Graphs

A Guided Decision Table Graph is a collection of related Guided Decision Tables that are displayed within a single table graph editor. You can use this editor to better visualize how your guided decision tables are linked, based on defined columns, or to link new guided decision tables as needed. Decision tables are linked in a guided decision table graph when a condition or an action in one table uses the same data type in a condition or an action of another table.

For example, if one decision table determines a loan application rate and another table uses the application rate to determine some other action, then the two decision tables can be linked in a guided decision table graph.
