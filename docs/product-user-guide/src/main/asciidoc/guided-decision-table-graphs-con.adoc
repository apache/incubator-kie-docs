= Guided Decision Table Graphs

A Guided Decision Table Graph is a collection of related guided decision tables that are displayed within a single editor. You can use this editor to better visualize and work with various related decision tables in one location. Additionally, when a condition or an action in one table uses the same data type as a condition or an action in another table, the tables will be physically linked with a line in the table graph editor.

For example, if one decision table determines a loan application rate and another table uses the application rate to determine some other action, then the two decision tables are linked in a guided decision table graph.

Decision tables that are not linked by matching conditions or actions will be free floating in the editor, with no physical link.
