The custom navigation trees can be deleted but the default tree can not be removed from {CENTRAL}. They can contain the default groups and entries from the *Workbench* tree as well as user created groups and trees.

.Procedure
. Log in to {CENTRAL} and go to *Menu* -> *Design* -> *Pages*.
. Select the *Navigation* panel and then click *New*.
