= Creating data objects

The data objects that you define are the building blocks for rule assets in your project and determine what data your assets and your decision service are based on. The following procedure is a generic overview of creating data objects. It is not specific to a particular business process.

.Procedure
. In {CENTRAL}, go to *Menu* -> *Design* -> *Projects* and click the project name.
. Click *Add Asset* → *Data Object*.
. Enter a unique *Data Object* name and select the *Package* where you want the data object to be available for other rule assets. Data objects with the same name cannot exist in the same package. The package that you specify must be the same package where the rule assets that require those data objects have been assigned or will be assigned.
+
.Importing data objects from other packages
[IMPORTANT]
====
You can also import an existing data object from another package into the package of the rule asset. Select the relevant rule asset within the project and in the asset designer, go to *Data Objects -> New item* to select the object to be imported.
====
+
. To make your data object persistable, select the *Persistable* checkbox. Persistable data objects are able to be stored in a database according to the JPA specification. The default JPA is Hibernate.
. Click *Ok*.
. In the data object designer, click *add field* to add a field to the object with the attributes *Id*, *Label*, and *Type*. Required attributes are marked with an asterisk (*).
* *Id:* Enter the unique ID of the field.
* *Label:* (Optional) Enter a label for the field.
* *Type:* Enter the data type of the field.
* *List:* Select this check box to enable the field to hold multiple items for the specified type.
