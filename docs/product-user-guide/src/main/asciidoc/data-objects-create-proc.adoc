= Creating a data object

The data objects that you define can be implemented in various types of project assets, such as in decision tables and guided rules, and are the essential building blocks for the assets in your project.

.Procedure
. Go to *Menu* -> *Design* -> *Projects* and click the project name.
. Click *Create New Asset* â†’ *Data Object*.
. Enter the name and select the package where you want the data object to be available for other assets. The name must be unique across the package, but it is possible to have two data objects with the same name in two different packages.

.Using data objects across packages
[IMPORTANT]
====
Data objects must be assigned or imported to the same package as the asset that requires the data object. Even if the asset and data object are in the same project, they cannot be used together unless they are found in the same package. To import an existing data object into the package of another asset, use the *Data Objects* tab of the specific asset designer. For example, see xref:guided-decision-tables-columns-create-proc[].
====
+
. To make your data object persistable, check the *Persistable* checkbox. Persistable data objects are based on the JPA specification, and Hibernate is the default JPA.
. Click *Ok*.
. Create fields of the data object:
+
.. Click *add field* in the main designer window to add a field to the object with the attributes *Id*, *Label* and *Type*. Required attributes are marked with *.
* *Id*: The ID of the field unique within the data object.
* *Label*: The label to be used in the *Fields* panel. This field is optional.
* *Type*: The data type of the field.
