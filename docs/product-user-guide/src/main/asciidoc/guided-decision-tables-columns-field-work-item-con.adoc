[[_guided_decision_tables_columns_field_work_item_con]]
= "Set the value of a field with a Work Item parameter"

With this column option, you can implement an action to set the value of a previously defined fact field to the value of a result parameter of a work item handler for the "THEN" portion of the rule. The work item must define a result parameter of the same data type as a field on a bound fact in order for you to set the field to the return parameter. (Work items are created in *Authoring* -> *Project Authoring* -> *_[select project]_* -> *Create new asset* -> *Work Item Definition*.)

An _<<_guided_decision_tables_columns_work_item_con, Execute a Work Item>>_ column must already be created in the table for this column option to be created.

.Required Column Parameters
The following parameters are required in the *Add a new column* wizard to set up this column type:

* *Pattern:* Select from the list of fact patterns already used in your table or create a new fact pattern. A fact pattern is a combination of an available data object in the package (see the note on <<_required_data_objects, Required data objects>> for details) and a model class binding that you specify. (Examples: `LoanApplication [application]` or `IncomeSource [income]` where the bracketed portion is the binding to the given fact type)
* *Field:* Select a field from the previously specified fact pattern. The field options are defined in the fact file in the *Data Objects* panel of your project. (Examples: `amount` or `lengthYears` fields within the `LoanApplication` fact type)
* *Work Item:* Select from the list of your predefined work items. Subsequent parameters will be displayed that correlate with the parameters defined in the work item definition. (The work item must define a result parameter of the same data type as a field on a bound fact in order for you to set the field to the return parameter.)
* *Header (description):* Add header text for the column.
* *Hide column:* Select this to hide the column, or clear this to display the column.
* *Logically insert:* This option appears when the selected Fact Pattern is not currently used in another column in the guided decision table (see the next field description). Select this to insert the fact pattern logically into the inference engine, or clear this to insert it regularly. The {PRODUCT} inference engine is responsible for logical decisions on insertions and retractions of facts. After regular or stated insertions, facts have to be retracted explicitly. After logical insertions, facts are automatically retracted when the conditions that asserted the facts in the first place are no longer true. For more details, see {URL_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE}#sect_truth_maintenance[Truth Maintenance] in the _{DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE}_.
* *Update engine with changes:* This option appears when the selected Fact Pattern is already used in another column in the guided decision table. Select this to update the rules engine with the modified field values, or clear this to not update the rules engine.
