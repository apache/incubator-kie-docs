= Rule expressions in FEEL

Friendly Enough Expression Language (FEEL) is a new expression language defined by the DMN specification. It aims to bridge the gap between decision modeling and execution by assigning semantics to the decision model constructs. FEEL expressions in decision requirements diagrams (DRD) occupy either table cells in decision tables or decision nodes. FEEL expressions define the logic of a decision.
