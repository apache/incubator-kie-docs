= Rule expressions in FEEL

Friendly Enough Expression Language (FEEL) is a new expression language defined by the DMN specification. It aims to bridge the gap between decision modeling and execution by assigning semantics to the decision model constructs.

FEEL expressions in decision requirements diagrams (DRD) occupy either table cells in decision tables or decision points. They define variables and input/output values, and are expressed in one of two levels of compliance:

* *Simple FEEL (S-FEEL):* Defines the more basic models with logic modeled mostly or entirely in decision tables. For more information, see Chapter 9, "Simple Expression Language (S-FEEL)", in the document _Decision Model and Notation (DMN)_ from OMG.
* *Expression language (FEEL):* Provides the full range of FEEL expressions defined in Chapter 10, "Expression Language (FEEL)", in the document _Decision Model and Notation (DMN)_ from OMG.
