= Adding GIVEN facts in test scenarios

The *GIVEN* section defines input facts for the test. For example, if an "Underage" rule in the project declines loan applications for applicants under the age of 21, then the *GIVEN* facts in the test scenario could be `Applicant` with `age` set to some integer less than 21.

.Prerequisite
All data objects required for your test scenario have been created or imported and are listed in the *Data Objects* tab of the test scenarios designer.

.Procedure

The list includes the following options, depending on the data objects available in the *Data Objects* tab of the test scenarios designer:

* *Insert a new fact:* Use this to add a fact and modify its field values. Enter a variable for the fact as the *Fact name*.
* *Modify an existing fact:* (Appears only after another fact has been added.) Use this to specify a previously inserted fact to be modified in the {ENGINE} between executions of the scenario.
* *Delete an existing fact:* (Appears only after another fact has been added.) Use this to specify a previously inserted fact to be deleted from the {ENGINE} between executions of the scenario.
* *Activate rule flow group:* Use this to specify a rule flow group to be activated so that all rules within that group can be tested.
