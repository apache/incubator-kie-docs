Process instances can be filtered on the following attributes:

*Id*:: Filter by process instance ID.
+
Input: `Numeric`

*Initiator*:: Filter by the user ID of the process instance initiator.
+
The user ID is a unique value, and depends on the ID management system.
+
Input: `String`

*Correlation key*:: Filter by correlation key. For more information about correlation keys, see the {URL_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE}[{DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE}].
+
Input: `String`

*Description*:: Filter by process instance description.
+
Input: `String`

State::
Filter by different states. Only one state filter can be applied to the search results at a time. Selecting a different state overwrites the current state filter. Removing the state filter displays all processes, regardless of state.
+
*Active*, *Completed*, and *Aborted* tabs in the *Process Instances* page display a list of all process instances with these states, however the filtering cannot be performed on these tabs. The following filter states are available:
+
** Active
** Aborted
** Completed
** Pending
** Suspended

Errors::
Filter by process instances with or without errors.

Name:: Filter by project name.

Date and time filtering::
+
Start Date::: When the process was started.
Last Update::: When the process was updated or modified.

:: Each of these filters have the following quick filter options:

** Last Hour
** Today
** Last 24 Hours
** Last 7 Days
** Last 30 Days
** Custom
+
Selecting *Custom* date and time filtering opens a calendar tool for selecting a date and time range.
