[id='deployment-units-con_{context}']
= Deployment units in {CENTRAL}

The services in a project are consumed at run time through an instantiated KIE container, or _deployment unit_, on a configured {KIE_SERVER}. When you build and deploy a project in {CENTRAL}, the deployment unit is created automatically in the configured server. You can start, stop, or remove deployment units in {CENTRAL} as needed. You can also create additional deployment units from previously built projects and start them on existing or new {KIE_SERVERS} configured in {CENTRAL}.
