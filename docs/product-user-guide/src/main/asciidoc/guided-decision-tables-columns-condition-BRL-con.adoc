= "Add a Condition BRL fragment"

A Business Rule Language (BRL) fragment is a section of a rule created using the guided rule designer. The condition BRL fragment is the "WHEN" portion of the rule, and the xref:guided-decision-tables-columns-action-BRL-con[action BRL fragment] is the "THEN" portion of the rule. With this column option, you can define a condition BRL fragment to be used in the left ("WHEN") side of a rule. Any *Template key* field values (as opposed to *Literal* or *Formula* values) that you add to conditions (example: `$rate`) form separate columns in the decision table. Simpler column types can refer to Facts and Fact fields bound in the BRL fragment and vice-versa.
