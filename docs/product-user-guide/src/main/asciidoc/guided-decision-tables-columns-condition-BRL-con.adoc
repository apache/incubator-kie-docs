[[_guided_decision_tables_columns_condition_BRL_con]]
= "Add a Condition BRL fragment"

A Business Rule Language (BRL) fragment is a section of a rule created using the Guided Rule Editor. The condition BRL fragment is the "WHEN" portion of the rule, and the <<_guided_decision_tables_columns_action_BRL_con, Action BRL fragment>> is the "THEN" portion of the rule. With this column option, you can define a Condition BRL fragment to be used in the left ("WHEN") side of a rule. In the embedded Guided Rule Editor, field values defined as "Template Keys" form columns in the decision table.
Simpler column types can refer to Facts and Fact fields bound in the BRL fragment and vice-versa.
