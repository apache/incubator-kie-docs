= Data Sets

A data set is a matrix of data which comprises of time stamps, texts and numbers. A data set can be stored in many ways, such as, in a database, in an excel file, in memory or in other ways. A data set definition, on the other hand, tells the Workbench on how to access, read and parse a data set.

Note that the Workbench will not store any data, it simply provides a way to define access to the data of a data set regardless of where that data is stored.

For example, letâ€™s take an example of data stored in a database. A valid data set could be, for example, the entire database or a subset of the database (the result of an SQL query). In both cases, the database will return data in the form of a matrix of rows and columns. Now this data is used as input for the reporting components which then displays this information in the form of charts or graphs.

To access a data set, we need to create and register a data set definition, which will define the following:
* where the data set is stored,
* how it can be accessed, read and parsed, and
* what columns it contains.

Note that the *Data Sets* page is visible only to users in the Administrator group.
