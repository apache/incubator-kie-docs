= Data Sets

The data set functionality in {CENTRAL} defines how to access and parse data.
Data sets serve as a source of data that can be displayed by the Dashbuilder displayer.
You can add the Dashbuilder displayers to a custom page in the *Plugin Management* page.
Note that the *Data Sets* page is visible only to users in the Administrator group.
