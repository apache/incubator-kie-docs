= Data Sets

The data set functionality in Business Central defines how to access and parse data.
Data sets serve as a source of data that can be displayed by the Dashbuilder displayer.
You can add the Dashbuilder displayers to a custom perspective in the *Plugin Management* perspective.
Note that the *Data Sets* perspective is visible only to users in the Administrator group.
