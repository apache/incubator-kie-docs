= Searching Process Instances Based on Business Data


You can add process variables as columns in the process instance list in order to enable flexible filtering of definitions based on business data.
To achieve this, do the following:

. On the top menu of the {CENTRAL}, go to *Menu* -> *Manage* -> *Process Instances*.
. In the list on the *Process Instances* tab, click image:plus_icon.png[]. The *New Process Instance List* dialog box opens.
. In the *New Process Instance List* dialog box, perform the following:
+
.. Provide the name and description for your search process instance list in the *Labels* tab.
.. Add a new query filter in the *Filter* tab:
+
... Click *Add New*.
... From the list of filter values, select *processId* and *equalsTo*.
... Provide a valid `processId` value and click *Ok*.

+
A new tab is created that displays your custom process instance list in a  tabular form.
This new tab provides process instance variables (business data) as selectable columns.
You can view the variables corresponding to each process instance in the table by enabling these columns, which are disabled by default.
