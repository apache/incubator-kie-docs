= Adding an `otherwise` operation to condition column cells

For simple condition columns in guided decision tables, you can apply an `otherwise` value to table cells within the column if the following parameters are set:

* *Calculation type* for the condition column has been set to `Literal value`.
* *Operator* has been set as equality `==` or inequality `!=`.

The `otherwise` value enables a rule to be defined for any other values not explicitly defined in the rules already in the table.

Example:

[source,java]
----
when
  Cheese( name not in ("Cheddar", "Edam", "Brie") )
  ...
then
  ...
end
----

[source,java]
----
when
  Cheese( name in ("Cheddar", "Edam", "Brie") )
  ...
then
  ...
end
----

.Procedure

. Select a cell of a condition column that uses the `==` or `!=` operator.
. In the upper-right toolbar of the table editor, click *Edit* -> *Otherwise*.
