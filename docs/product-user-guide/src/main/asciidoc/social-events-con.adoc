= Social Events

In {PRODUCT}, if you are an administrative user, you can follow other Business Central users and gain insight into what activities are being performed by those users. You can also view timelines of regular events and activities in Business Central. This capability is powered by the implementation of a Social Activities framework.
This framework ensures that event notifications are generated by different activities within the system and that these notifications are broadcast for registered actors to view.

Events are triggered when a repository, resource, or process is added or updated in Business Central. You can then view these notifications in Business Central.
