= Creating a Project

Projects are containers for asset packages that are housed in the repository within your defined organizational unit in Business Central. Projects define the properties of the KIE Base and KIE Session that are applied to their content.

You can create a project in two ways:

* In the Business Central user interface
* With Knowledge Store REST API calls
