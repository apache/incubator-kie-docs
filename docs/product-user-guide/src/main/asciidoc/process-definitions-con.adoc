= Process Definitions

After you have created, configured, and deployed your project comprising your business processes, you can view the list of all the process definitions in *Menu* → *Manage* → *Process Definitions*.
The process definition view contains two main sections:

* Process Definition Lists
* Process Definition Details

The process definition list shows all the available process definitions that are deployed into the platform. If you click on any of the process definition listed in the Process Definitions List, the corresponding Process Definition details displays information about the process definition such as if there is a sub-process associated with it, or how many users and groups exist in the process definition.
In the Process Definition details section, you can navigate to *Options* -> *View Process Instances* to view associated process instances.
