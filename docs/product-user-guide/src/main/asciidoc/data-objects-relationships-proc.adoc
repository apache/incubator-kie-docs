. Click *Save* to save your changes.

NOTE: Attempting to delete a data object that is used by a different data object will show the *Usage Detected* screen.
It is still possible to delete the object from here, however this will stop your project from building successfully until the resulting errors are resolved. To properly delete a data object, use the *Data Objects* editor in your Project Explorer.
