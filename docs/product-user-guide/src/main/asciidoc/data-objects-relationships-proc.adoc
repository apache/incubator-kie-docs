 symbol in the object attribute list in the Data Modeler. You can jump to the data object definition to view and edit by clicking on the icon.

.Procedure
. In the data object editor, select the data object attribute from the list.
. Click the *Persistence* icon on the right side of the editor.
. Under *Relationship Properties*, click the *Relationship Type* property editing option, and fill in the fields as needed.

. Click *Save* to save your changes.

NOTE: Attempting to delete a data object that is used by a different data object will show the *Usage Detected* screen.
It is still possible to delete the object from here, however this will stop your project from building successfully until the resulting errors are resolved. To properly delete a data object, use the *Data Objects* editor in your Project Explorer.
