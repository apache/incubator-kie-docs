= Duplicate GAV Detection

All Maven repositories are checked for any duplicated `GroupId`, `ArtifactId`, and `Version` (GAV). If a GAV duplicate exists, the performed operation is cancelled.

The duplicate GAV detection is executed every time you perform the following operations:

* Create a new managed repository.
* Save a project definition in the Project Editor.
* Add new modules to a managed multi-module repository.
* Save the `pom.xml` file.
* Install, build, or deploy a project.

The following Maven repositories are checked for duplicate GAVs:

* Repositories specified in the `<repositories>` and `<distributionManagement>` elements of the `pom.xml` file.
* Repositories specified in the Maven's `settings.xml` configuration file.
