= Duplicate GAV detection

All Maven repositories are checked for any duplicated `GroupId`, `ArtifactId`, and `Version` (GAV) attributes. If a GAV duplicate exists, the performed operation is canceled.

The duplicate GAV detection is executed every time you perform the following operations:

* Save a project definition for the project.
* Save the `pom.xml` file.
* Install, build, or deploy a project.

The following Maven repositories are checked for duplicate GAVs:

* Repositories specified in the `<repositories>` and `<distributionManagement>` elements of the `pom.xml` file.
* Repositories specified in the Maven `settings.xml` configuration file.
