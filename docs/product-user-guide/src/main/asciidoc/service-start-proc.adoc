= Starting a service in {KIE_SERVER}

If you have configured a {KIE_SERVER} to use a Maven repository, you can use an API call to start a service from a project. The service is started automatically.

.Procedure
To load a service into a deployment unit in the {KIE_SERVER} and start it, run the following command to send an API request:

[subs="verbatim,macros"]
----
$ curl --user "<username>:<password>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X PUT -d '{"container-id" : "<containerID>","release-id" : {"group-id" : "<groupID>","artifact-id" : "<artifactID>","version" : "<version>"}}' http://<serverhost>:<serverport>/kie-server/services/rest/server/containers/<containerID>
----

Replace the following values:

* *<username>:* The user name of a user who can log on to {KIE_SERVER} and administer it.
* *<password>:* The password for the user who can log on to {KIE_SERVER} and administer it.
* *<containerID>:* The identifier for the deployment unit (container). You can use any random identifier but it must be the same in both places in the command (the URL and the data).
* *<groupID>*, *<artifactID>*, *version:* The project GAV values.
* *<serverhost>:* The host name for the {KIE_SERVER}, or `localhost` if you are running the command on the same host as the {KIE_SERVER}.
* *<serverport>:* The port number for the {KIE_SERVER}.

For example:
