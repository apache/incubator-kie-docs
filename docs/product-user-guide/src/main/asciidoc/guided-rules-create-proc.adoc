= Creating guided rules

Guided rules enable you to define business rules in a structured format, based on the data objects associated with the rules. You can create and define guided rules individually for your project.

.Procedure
. Go to *Menu* -> *Design* -> *Projects* and click the project name.
. Click *Create New Asset* -> *Guided Rule*.
. Enter an informative *Guided Rule* name and select the appropriate *Package*. The package that you specify must be the same package where the required data objects have been assigned or will be assigned.
+
You can also select *Use Domain Specific Language (DSL)* if any DSL assets have been defined in your project (in the *Domain Specific Language Definitions* panel in the *Project Explorer*). These DSL assets will then become usable objects for conditions and actions that you define in the guided rule designer.
+
. Click *Ok* to create the rule asset.

The new guided rule is now listed in the *Guided Rules* panel of the *Project Explorer*, or in the *Guided Rules (with DSL)* panel if you selected the *Use Domain Specific Language (DSL)* option.

. Click the *Data Objects* tab and confirm that all data objects required for your rules are listed. If not, click *New item* to import objects from other packages, or **create new data objects(expand content from data-objects-create-proc.adoc) within the package.
. After all data objects are in place, return to the *Editor* tab and use the buttons on the right of the editor window to add and define the *WHEN* (condition) and *THEN* (action) sections of the rule, based on the available data objects.

The *WHEN* part of the rule is the condition that must be met to execute an action. For example, if a bank requires loan applicants to have over 21 years of age, then the *WHEN* condition would be `Age | greater than | 21`.
+
The *THEN* part of the rule is the action to be performed when the conditional part of the rule has been met. For example, when the loan applicant is under 21 years old, the *THEN* action would set `approved` to `false`, declining the loan because the applicant is under age.
+
You can also specify exceptions for more complex rules, such as if a bank may approve of an under-aged applicant when a guarantor is involved. In that case, you would add the *guarantor* to the list of *Data Objects* and then add the field to the guided rule. For more information about adding a field to a fact type, see <<data_modeler_con>>.

For more details about adding conditions and actions, see <<guided_rules_WHEN_proc>> and <<guided_rules_THEN_proc>>.
