= Creating Guided Rules

Guided rules enable you to define business rules in a structured format, based on the data objects associated with the rules. You can create and define guided rules individually for your project.

.Procedure
. Go to *Authoring* -> *Project Authoring* and select your project.
. Click *Create New Asset* -> *Guided Rule*.
. Enter an informative *Guided Rule* name and select the appropriate *Package*. You can check *Use Domain Specific Language (DSL)* to use DSL. For details, see <<rules_dsl_con>>.
+
The new Guided Rule is now created under the selected project.

. Use the buttons on the right of the editor window to add and define the *WHEN* (condition) and *THEN* (action) sections of the rule.

The *WHEN* part of the rule is the condition that must be met to execute an action. For example, if a bank providing loans requires customers to have over 21 years of age, then the *WHEN* condition would be `Age | greater than | 21`.
+
The *THEN* part of the rule is the action to be performed when the conditional part of the rule has been met. For example, when the customer is under 21 years old, then the *THEN* action would set `approved` to `false`, declining the loan because the applicant is under age.
+
You can also specify exceptions for more complex rules, such as if a bank may approve of an under-aged applicant when a guarantor is involved. In that case, you would add the *guarantor* to the list of *Data Objects* and then add the field to the guided rule. For more information about adding a field to a fact type, see <<data_modeler_con>>.

. Under the *THEN* section, click *(show options...)* to set additional rule attributes, such as `ruleflow-group`, `salience`, and `date-expires`.
