= Creating Guided Rules

Guided rules enable you to define business rules in a structured format, based on the data objects associated with the rules. You can create and define guided rules individually for your project.

.Procedure
. Go to *Menu* -> *Design* -> *Projects* and click the project name.
. Click *Create New Asset* -> *Guided Rule*.
. Enter an informative *Guided Rule* name and select the appropriate *Package*. You can check *Use Domain Specific Language (DSL)* to use DSL. For details, see <<rules_dsl_con>>.
+
The new Guided Rule is now created under the selected project.

. Click the *Data Objects* tab and confirm that all data objects required for your rules are listed. If not, click *New item* to import objects from other packages, or **create new data objects(expand content from data-objects-create-proc.adoc) within the package.
. After all data objects are in place, return to the *Editor* tab and use the buttons on the right of the editor window to add and define the *WHEN* (condition) and *THEN* (action) sections of the rule, based on the available data objects.

The *WHEN* part of the rule is the condition that must be met to execute an action. For example, if a bank requires loan applicants to have over 21 years of age, then the *WHEN* condition would be `Age | greater than | 21`.
+
The *THEN* part of the rule is the action to be performed when the conditional part of the rule has been met. For example, when the loan applicant is under 21 years old, the *THEN* action would set `approved` to `false`, declining the loan because the applicant is under age.
+
You can also specify exceptions for more complex rules, such as if a bank may approve of an under-aged applicant when a guarantor is involved. In that case, you would add the *guarantor* to the list of *Data Objects* and then add the field to the guided rule. For more information about adding a field to a fact type, see <<data_modeler_con>>.
