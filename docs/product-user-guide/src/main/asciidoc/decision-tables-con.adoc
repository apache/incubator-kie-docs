= Decision tables

Decision tables are XLS or XLSX spreadsheets that you can use to define business rules in a tabular format and that you can upload to your project in {CENTRAL}. Each row in the spreadsheet is a rule, and each column is a condition, an action, or another rule attribute. After you create and upload your decision tables, the rules you defined are compiled into DRL (Drools Rule Language) rules as with all other rule assets.
