= Decision tables

Decision tables are XLS or XLSX spreadsheets that you can use to define business rules in a tabular format and that you can upload to your project in {CENTRAL}. Each row in the spreadsheet is a rule, and each column is a condition, an action, or another rule attribute. After you create and upload your decision tables, the rules you defined are compiled into Drools Rule Language (DRL) rules as with all other rule assets.

All data objects related to an uploaded decision table must be in the same project package as the uploaded decision table. Assets in the same package are imported by default. Existing assets in other packages can be imported with the decision table.
