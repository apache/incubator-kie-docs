= Options for invoking a DMN model

To invoke a decision that is defined in a DMN file, it should first be packaged in a knowledge container. A specific version of Knowledge Components comes in what is known as a Knowledge JAR (KJAR), which you can either deploy to the {KIE_SERVER} for remote access, or manipulate directly as a dependency of the calling application. Covering all options for creating and deploying these knowledge packages is outside the scope of this document, although most are similar to other knowledge assets (for example, a Drools rule file or jBPM process definition). After you have packaged or deployed the decision, you have several options for invoking it.
