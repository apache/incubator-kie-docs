= Guided rule templates

Guided rule templates are business rule structures with place-holder values (template keys) that are interchanged with actual values defined in separate data tables. Each row of values defined in the corresponding data table for that template results in a rule. Guided rule templates are ideal when many guided rules have the same conditions, actions, and other attributes but differ in values of facts or constraints. In such cases, instead of creating sets of similar guided rules and defining values in each rule, you can create a guided rule template with the rule structure that applies to each rule and then define only the differing values in the data table. These templates are a  flexibility of rules in existing databases.

All data objects related to the rule template must be in the same project package as the rule template. Assets in the same package are imported by default. You can use the *Data Objects* tab of the rule template designer to verify that all required data objects are listed or to import any other needed data objects by adding a *New item*.
