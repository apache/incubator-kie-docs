= Guided Rule Templates

Guided Rule Templates enable you to define a rule structure and provide a place-holder for values and data to generate many rules. From the user's perspective, Guided Rule Templates are parameterized guided rules that contain a data table that provides parameter values. The templates enable more flexible decision tables and can enhance the flexibility of rules in existing databases.

For information about managing dependencies of Rule Templates, see the _Dependency Management for Guided Decision Tables, Scorecards, and Rule Templates_ section of the _{DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE}_.
