= Guided decision tables

Guided decision tables are a wizard-led alternative to uploaded decision table spreadsheets for defining business rules in a tabular format. With guided decision tables, you are led by a UI-based wizard in {CENTRAL} that helps you define rule attributes, metadata, conditions, and actions based on specified data objects in your project. After you create your guided decision tables, the rules you defined are compiled into Drools Rule Language (DRL) rules as with all other rule assets.

All data objects related to a guided decision table must be in the same project package as the guided decision table. Assets in the same package are imported by default. After you create the necessary data objects and the guided decision table, you can use the *Data Objects* tab of the guided decision tables designer to verify that all required data objects are listed or to import other existing data objects by adding a *New item*.
