= About Guided Decision Tables

_<Pending rework. Concept of what GDTs are.>_

The Guided Decision Table feature works similarly to the Guided Editor by outlining available facts and fields to guide the creation of a decision table.

Rule attributes, meta-data, conditions, and actions can be defined in a tabular format, thus facilitating rapid entry of large sets of related rules.
Guided decision table rules are compiled into DRL like all other rule assets.
