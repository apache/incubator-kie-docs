= Guided decision tables

Guided decision tables are a wizard-led alternative to uploaded decision table spreadsheets for defining business rules in a tabular format. With guided decision tables, you are led by a UI-based wizard in {CENTRAL} that helps you define rule attributes, metadata, conditions, and actions based on specified data objects in your project. After you create your guided decision tables, the rules you defined are compiled into DRL (Drools Rule Language) rules as with all other rule assets. You can validate the decision tables and resolve any errors before building and deploying your project.
