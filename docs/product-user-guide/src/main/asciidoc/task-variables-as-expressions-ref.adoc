= Task Variables as Expressions


You can refer and use the task variables in task properties as soon as you create a task.
For example, once your task has been created, you can define a task name that refers to a [var]``taskId``.
Task variables are resolved at both task creation time and notification time, unlike process variables, which  are resolved only at task creation time.
The ability of using task variables while creating tasks minimizes your Java code, such as calling {PRODUCT} APIs.

Task variables are available as task instances and you can get access to task information using the following expression:

[source,java]
----
${task.id}
----


You can use this expression in data input of user task from within the process definition.

For example, the following expression can be used for accessing the [var]``processInstanceId`` variable:

[source,java]
----
${task.taskData.processInstanceId}
----
