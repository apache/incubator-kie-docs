<kmodule xmlns="http://www.drools.org/xsd/kmodule" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
  <kbase name="myBase" default="true" eventProcessingMode="stream" equalsBehavior="identity" packages="*">
    <ksession name="mySession" type="stateless" default="true" clockType="realtime"/>
  </kbase>
</kmodule>
----
. Click *Save* in the top right corner.

You can switch between the Project Editor view and the Repository view to look at the changes you make in each view.
To do so, close and reopen the view each time a change is made.

[NOTE]
====
If you have more than one knowledge base, one of them must be marked __default__.
You also must define one default stateful knowledge session among all the bases and sessions.
Alternatively, you can choose to not define any knowledge bases.
