= Creating DRL rules

Guided rules enable you to define business rules in a structured format, based on the data objects associated with the rules. You can create and define guided rules individually for your project.

.Procedure
. Go to *Menu* -> *Design* -> *Projects* and click the project name.
. Click *Create New Asset* -> *DRL file*.
. Enter an informative *DRL file* name and select the appropriate *Package*. The package that you specify must be the same package where the required data objects have been assigned or will be assigned.
+
You can also select *Use Domain Specific Language (DSL)* if any DSL assets have been defined in your project (in the *Domain Specific Language Definitions* panel in the *Project Explorer*). These DSL assets will then become usable objects for conditions and actions that you define in the DRL designer.
+
. Click *Ok* to create the rule asset.
+
The new DRL file is now listed in the *DRL* panel of the *Project Explorer*, or in the *DSLR* panel if you selected the *Use Domain Specific Language (DSL)* option. The package to which you assigned this DRL file is listed at the top of the file.
. Review the list of *Fact types* in the left panel of the DRL designer and confirm that all data objects required for your rules are listed. If not, xref:data-objects-create-proc_guided-rules[create new data objects] within your package. *<@Michael: How can users import data objects from other packages when using DRL? In other guided rule type assets, there's the Data Objects tab in the designer that they can go to and import objects from other packages, and I mention that about here normally. But with DRL?>*

+
. After all data objects are in place, return to the *Editor* tab of the DRL designer and define the DRL file with any of the following elements:
* `package`: (automatic) This was defined for you when you created the DRL file and selected the package.
* `import`: d
* `global`: (optional)
* `function`: (optional)
* `query`: (optional)
* `rule`:

The *WHEN* part of the rule is the condition that must be met to execute an action. For example, if a bank requires loan applicants to have over 21 years of age, then the *WHEN* condition would be `Applicant( age > 21 )`.
+
The *THEN* part of the rule is the action to be performed when the conditional part of the rule has been met. For example, when the loan applicant is under 21 years old, the *THEN* action would `setApproved( false )`, declining the loan because the applicant is under age.
+
You can also specify exceptions for more complex rules, such as if a bank may approve of an under-aged applicant when a guarantor is involved. In that case, you would create or import a *guarantor* data object and then add the field to the guided rule.

. After you define all components of the rule, click *Validate* in the upper-right toolbar of the DRL designer to validate the DRL file. If the file validation fails, address any problems described in the error message, review all syntax and components in the DRL file, and try again to validate the file until the file passes.
. Click *Save* in the DRL designer to save your work.
