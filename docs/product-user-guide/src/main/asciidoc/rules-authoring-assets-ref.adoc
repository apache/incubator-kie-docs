[id='rules-authoring-assets-ref_{context}']
= Rule-authoring assets in {PRODUCT}

{PRODUCT} provides several assets that you can use to create business rules for your decision service. Each rule-authoring asset has different advantages, and you might prefer to use one or a combination of multiple assets depending on your goals and needs.

The following table highlights each rule-authoring asset in {CENTRAL} to help you decide or confirm the best method for creating rules in your decision service.

|Asset
|Highlights
|Documentation

|Guided decision tables
a|
* Are tables of rules that you create in a UI-based table designer in {CENTRAL}
* Are a wizard-led alternative to uploaded decision table spreadsheets
* Provide fields and options for acceptable input
* Support template keys and values for creating rule templates
* Support hit policies, real-time validation, and other additional features not supported in other assets
* Are optimal for creating rules in a controlled tabular format to minimize compilation errors
|Designing a decision service using guided decision tables


|Uploaded decision tables
a|
* Are XLS or XLSX decision table spreadsheets that you upload into {CENTRAL}
* Support template keys and values for creating rule templates
* Are optimal for creating rules in decision tables already managed outside of {CENTRAL}
* Have strict syntax requirements for rules to be compiled properly when uploaded
|Designing a decision service using uploaded decision tables


|Guided rules
a|
* Are individual rules that you create in a UI-based rule designer in {CENTRAL}
* Provide fields and options for acceptable input
* Are optimal for creating single rules in a controlled format to minimize compilation errors
|Designing a decision service using guided rules


|Guided rule templates
a|
* Are reusable rule structures that you create in a UI-based template designer in {CENTRAL}
* Provide fields and options for acceptable input
* Support template keys and values for creating rule templates (fundamental to the purpose of this asset)
* Are optimal for creating many rules with the same rule structure but with different defined field values
|Designing a decision service using guided rule templates


|DRL rules
a|
* Are individual rules that you define directly in `.drl` text files
* Provide the most flexibility for defining rules and other technicalities of rule behavior
* Can be created in certain standalone environments and integrated with {PRODUCT}
* Are optimal for creating rules that require advanced DRL options
* Have strict syntax requirements for rules to be compiled properly
