= Executing DMN services remotely on the {KIE_SERVER} (Java)

This section explains how to interact with a KIE Container deployed on a {KIE_SERVER} to execute decision services from a Java application. This approach leverages the KIE Server Java Client to interact with the remote service using minimal code.

.Prerequisites

* {KIE_SERVER} installed and configured, including a known username/credential for a user with the "kie-server" role.

* A KIE Container deployed in the {KIE_SERVER} in the form of a KJAR that includes the DMN model.

* Knowing the container ID of the KIE Container containing the DMN model. If more than one model is present, you must also know the model namespace and model name of the relevant model.

* The following dependency is added to the pom.xml of the project:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.kie.server</groupId>
  <artifactId>kie-server-client</artifactId>
  <version>${drools-version}</version>
</dependency>
----

NOTE: *${drools-version}* is a Maven property that should resolve to the precise version used for other KIE / Drools dependencies at runtime.

.Procedure
. Instantiate a KieServicesClient instance with the appropriate connection information.
+
The following snippet illustrates establishing this configuration:
+
.Instantiating KieServicesClient
[source,java]
----
KieServicesConfiguration conf =
    KieServicesFactory.newRestConfiguration(URL, USER, PASSWORD); // <1>

conf.setMarshallingFormat(MarshallingFormat.JSON);  // <2>

KieServicesClient kieServicesClient = KieServicesFactory.newKieServicesClient(conf);
----
Supply the connection information in Line 1:
+
* Example URL: http://localhost:8080/kie-server/services/rest/server
* The credentials should reference a user with the “kie-server” role.
+
In Line 2, Marshalling format is an instance of org.kie.server.api.marshalling.MarshallingFormat. It controls whether the messages will be JSON or XML. Options for Marshalling format are JSON, JAXB, or XSTREAM.

. Obtain a DMNServicesClient from the KIE server Java client connected to the related {KIE_SERVER} by invoking the method getServicesClient() on the KIE Server Java client instance, as shown in the following example:
+
[source,java]
----
DMNServicesClient dmnClient = kieServicesClient.getServicesClient(DMNServicesClient.class );
----
+
The dmnClient can now execute decision services on the {KIE_SERVER}.

. Execute the decision services for the desired model.
+
The following snippet provides a basic example:
+
[source,java]
----
for (Integer age : Arrays.asList(1,12,13,64,65,66)) {
	DMNContext dmnContext = dmnClient.newContext(); // <1>
	dmnContext.set("Age", age);       // <2>
	ServiceResponse<DMNResult> serverResp =           // <3>
			dmnClient.evaluateAll($kieContainerId,
					$modelNamespace,
					$modelName,
					dmnContext);

	DMNResult dmnResult = serverResp.getResult();   // <4>
	for (DMNDecisionResult dr : dmnResult.getDecisionResults()) {
		log.info("Age " + age + " Decision '" + dr.getDecisionName() + "' : " + dr.getResult());
	}
}
----
<1> Instantiate a new DMN Context to be the input for the model evaluation. Note that this example is looping through the Age Classification decision multiple times.
<2> Assign input variables for the input DMN Context.
<3> Evaluate all the DMN Decisions defined in the DMN model where $containerId is the ID of the container where the kjar containing the DMN model is deployed, $modelNamespace the namespace for the model, $modelName is the name for the model.
<4> The DMN Result object is available from the server response.

At this point, the dmnResult contains all the decision results from the evaluated DMN model.

NOTE: It is possible to execute only a specific DMN Decision in the model, by making use of alternative methods of the DMNServicesClient.

TIP: If the KIE Container only contains one DMN Model, it is possible to omit $modelnamespace and $modelname because the KIE API will select it by default.
