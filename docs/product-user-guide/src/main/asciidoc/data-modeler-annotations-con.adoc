= Annotations in the Data Modeler

{PRODUCT} supports all Drools annotations by default, and can be customized using the *Drools & jBPM* domain screen. For further information about available domain screens, see <<data_object_domain_screens_con>>.

When you create or add fields to a persistable data object, the JPA annotations that are added by default will generate a model that can be used by {PRODUCT} at runtime.

{PRODUCT} supports the use of JPA-specific annotations, with *Hibernate* available as the default JPA implementation.
Other JPA annotations are also supported where the JPA provider is loaded on the classpath.
