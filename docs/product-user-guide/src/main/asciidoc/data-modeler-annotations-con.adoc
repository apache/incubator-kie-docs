= Annotations in the Data Modeler

{PRODUCT} supports all Drools annotations by default, and can be customized using the *Drools & jBPM* domain screen. For further information about available domain screens, see <<data_object_domain_screens_con>>.

When you create or add fields to a persistable data object, the JPA annotations that are added by default will generate a model that can be used by {PRODUCT} at runtime.
In general, modifying the default configurations where the model will be used by processes is not recommended.

{PRODUCT} 6.2 and later supports the use of JPA-specific annotations, with *Hibernate* available as the default JPA implementation.
Other JPA annotations are also supported where the JPA provider is loaded on the classpath.

[NOTE]
====
When adding an annotation in the Data Modeler, ensure that the annotation class is on the workbench classpath. If not, a project dependency can be added to a `.jar` file that has the annotation. The Data Modeler runs a validation check to confirm that the annotation is on the classpath, and the project will not build if the annotation is not present.
