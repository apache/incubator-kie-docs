Case management stages are a collection of tasks that must be completed in order to reach specific milestones, or to resolve the case. A stage is an ad hoc subprocess that can be defined using the process designer and may include other case management nodes, such as a milestone. A milestone can also be configured as completed when a stage or a number of stages are completed. Therefore, a milestone may be activated or achieved by the completion of a stage, and a stage may include a milestone or a number of milestones.

A stage represents activities that are meant to serve certain business purposes. For example, in a patient triage case, the first stage may consist of observing and noting any obvious physical symptoms or a description from the patient of what their symptoms are, followed by a second stage for tests, and a third for diagnosis and treatment. 

A stage consists of the following elements:  

* Allowed process fragments and standalone activities
* Some activities that can start upon stage activation (`Adhoc autostart`)
* Reaction to changes in case file data

There are three ways to complete a stage:

* By completion condition.
* By terminal end event.
* By setting the `AdHocCompletionCondition` to `autocomplete`, which will automatically complete the stage when there are no active tasks.
