= Building and Deploying Assets

Click *Build & Deploy* as shown in the following screen to build and deploy packages and assets.

The *Problems* window below the project screen displays error messages (for example compilation errors) that can cause a failure in the build.

You can choose to build the whole package, or its subset.

If a project contains a large number of assets (rules, decision tables, or others), the build process may be slower than usual. After a successful build, you can download the binary package as a JAR file under *Authoring* -> *Artifact Repository*.

=== Duplicate GAV Detection

Every time you perform any of the operations listed below, all Maven repositories are checked for duplicate `GroupId`, `ArtifactId`, and `Version`. If a duplicate exists, the performed operation is cancelled.

The duplicate GAV detection is executed every time you:

* Create a new managed repository.
* Save a project definition in the Project Editor.
* Add new modules to a managed multi-module repository.
* Save the `pom.xml` file.
* Install, build, or deploy a project.

The following Maven repositories are checked for duplicates:

* Repositories specified in the `<repositories>` and `<distributionManagement>` elements of the `pom.xml` file.
* Repositories specified in the Maven's `settings.xml` configuration file.

Users with the `admin` role can modify the list of affected repositories. To do so, open your project in the Project Editor and click *Project Settings: Project General Settings* -> *Validation*.
