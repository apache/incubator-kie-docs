// Purpose statement for the assembly
As a business analyst or business rules developer, you can define business rule templates using the guided rule templates designer in {CENTRAL}. These guided rule templates provide a reusable rule structure for multiple rules that are compiled into DRL (Drools Rule Language) and form the core of the decision service for your project.

.Prerequisite
The team and project for the guided rule templates have been created in {CENTRAL}. Each asset is associated with a project assigned to a team. For details, see Getting started with decision services.
