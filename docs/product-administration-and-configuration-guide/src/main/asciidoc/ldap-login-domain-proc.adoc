= Define the LDAP login domain

When you are setting up {PRODUCT} to use LDAP for authentication and authorization, define the LDAP login domain. This is because the Git SSH authentication may be using another security domain, in which case you may face authentication failure. 

To define the LDAP login domain, use the  `org.uberfire.domain` system property. For example, on {EAP_LONG}, add this property in the `standalone.xml` file as shown below:


[source]
----
 <system-properties>
   <!-- other system properties -->
   <property name="org.uberfire.domain" value="LDAPAuth"/>
 </system-properties>
----

Ensure that the authenticated user has appropriate roles (`admin`,`analyst`,`reviewer`) associated with it in LDAP.
