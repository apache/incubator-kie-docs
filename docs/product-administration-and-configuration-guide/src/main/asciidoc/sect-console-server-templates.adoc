= Management Console Server Templates

The Business Central management console integrates with the Intelligent Process Server router through the controller to allow a consolidated view of process instances, and allows you to interact with multiple servers through the same UI. Servers can be managed using the server templates, which are a definition of the runtime environment.

A server template consists of:

* Name.
* A list of assigned containers (KJARs).
* A list of available capabilities.

Server templates can be created using the following procedure:

. In Business Central, click *Deploy*.
. From the *Deploy* menu, click *Execution Servers*.
. Click *New Server Template* in the top left corner.
. Fill out the *Name* field and select the capabilities you want the server to have from the following options:
+
** Rule
** Process
** Planning
+
You can select all or none of the above capabilities.

. Click *Finish* to complete the Server template.
+
Alternatively, you can click *Next* to edit or create a container using the Container template. For further information about how to create a container, see <<_creating_a_container,Creating Containers>>.

Servers that are started and connected to Business Central appear in the server management screen under *Remote Servers*. Remote servers reflect the current state of controller knowledge, with changes to the list triggered by the following server events:

* The start of a server in managed mode, which connects to the controller and registers itself as a remote server.

* The shut down of a server in managed mode, which notifies the controller to unregister itself from remote servers.

Using the *Execution Servers* page, you can create as many server templates as required, with each template backed by as many server instances as it needs. This gives complete control of individual server template scalability.
