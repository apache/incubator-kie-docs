= Integrating {PRODUCT} with Red Hat JBoss Fuse

Red Hat JBoss Fuse integration allows users of Red Hat JBoss Fuse to complement their integration solution with additional features provided by Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite and Red Hat JBoss BRMS.

{PRODUCT} integration is provided by two `features.xml` files:

* `drools-karaf-features-VERSION-features.xml`
+
This file provides core Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite and Red Hat JBoss BRMS features, which defines the OSGi features that can be deployed into Red Hat JBoss Fuse. This file is a part of the Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite and Red Hat JBoss BRMS product. OSGi users can install features from this file in order to install Red Hat JBoss BRMS engine or Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite engine into Red Hat JBoss Fuse and use it in their applications.

* `karaf-features-VERSION-features.xml`
+
This file provides additional features used for integrating Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite and Red Hat JBoss BRMS with Apache Camel, primarily in Red Hat JBoss Fuse. This file is part of the Integration Pack and it defines OSGi features that enable integration with Apache Camel and SwitchYard. In addition to the `karaf-features` XML file, the Integration Pack also contains a `features.xml` file for quick starts.

* `drools-karaf-features-VERSION-features-fuse-6_3.xml`
+
This file is used for integration of {PRODUCT} with Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.3.0. 

For further information about integration of {PRODUCT} with Red Hat JBoss Fuse, see the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_JBoss_Fuse/6.2.1/html-single/Integration_Guide/index.html#Install_Integration_Pack[Install Integration Pack] chapter of the _Red Hat JBoss Fuse Integration Guide_.

== Core Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite and Red Hat JBoss BRMS Features

Core Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite and Red Hat JBoss BRMS features are provided by one of the following files:

* For integration with Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.2.1, use the `drools-karaf-features-VERSION-features.xml` file.
* For integration with Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.3.0, use the `drools-karaf-features-VERSION-features-fuse-6_3.xml` file
+
`VERSION` is the version of {PRODUCT} you are using, for example `6.5.0.Final-redhat-9`. See the
ifdef::BA[]
{URL_INSTALLATION_GUIDE}#supported_comps[Supported Component Versions] chapter of the _{INSTALLATION_GUIDE}_.
endif::BA[]
ifdef::DM[]
{URL_INSTALLATION_GUIDE}#supported_comps[Supported Component Versions] chapter of the _{INSTALLATION_GUIDE}_.
endif::DM[]


The files are present in the product Maven repository (`org/drools/drools-karaf-features`) or the `jboss-brms-bpmsuite-VERSION-redhat-VERSION-fuse-features.zip` file. These files provide the following features:

* `drools-common`
* `drools-module`
* `drools-templates`
* `drools-decisiontable`
* `drools-jpa`
* `kie`
* `kie-ci`
* `kie-spring`
* `kie-aries-blueprint`
* `jbpm-commons`
* `jbpm-human-task`
* `jbpm`
* `droolsjbpm-hibernate`
* `h2`

The following table provides example of use cases for some of the features listed above.

.Features and Use Case Examples
[cols="1,1", frame="all", options="header"]
|===
| Feature
| Use Case

|``drools-module``
| Use the Red Hat JBoss BRMS engine for rules evaluation, without requiring persistence, processes, or decision tables.

|``drools-jpa``
| Use the Red Hat JBoss BRMS engine for rules evaluation with persistence and transactions, but without requiring processes or decision tables. The `drools-jpa` feature already includes ``drools-module``, however you may also need to install the `droolsjbpm-hibernate` feature, or ensure there is a compatible hibernate bundle installed.

|``drools-decisiontable``
| Use the Red Hat JBoss BRMS engine with decision tables.

|``jbpm``
| Use the Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite (or Red Hat JBoss BRMS engine with processes). The `jbpm` feature already includes `drools-module` and ``drools-jpa``. You may also need to install the `droolsjbpm-hibernate` feature, or ensure that there is a compatible hibernate bundle installed.

|``jbpm`` and `jbpm-human-task`
| Use the Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite (or Red Hat JBoss BRMS engine with processes) with Human Task.

| core engine JARs and `kie-ci`
| Use Red Hat JBoss BRMS or Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite with `KieScanner` (KIE-CI) to download kJARs from a Maven repository.

|``kie-spring``
| Use KIE-Spring integration. See <<_spring>> for more information.

|``kie-spring`` and `kie-aries-blueprint`
| Use KIE-Aries-Blueprint integration.
|===

[id='_spring']
[float]
=== kie-spring Feature Further Information

* Use `org.drools.osgi.spring.OsgiKModuleBeanFactoryPostProcessor` instead of `org.kie.spring.KModuleBeanFactoryPostProcessor` to postprocess KIE elements in an OSGi environment.
* Do not install the `drools-module` feature before the `kie-spring` feature. Otherwise, the `drools-compiler` bundle does not detect packages exported by ``kie-spring``.
+
Run `_osgi:refresh drools-compiler_bundle_ID_` if you have installed the features in the incorrect order to force `drools-compiler` to rebuild its Import-Package metadata.


== Additional Features for SwitchYard and Apache Camel Integration

The following additional features for integration with SwitchYard and Apache Camel on Red Hat JBoss Fuse are provided by the integration pack:

* `fuse-bxms-switchyard-common-knowledge`
* `fuse-bxms-switchyard-rules`
* `fuse-bxms-switchyard-bpm`
* `kie-camel`
* `jbpm-workitems-camel`


The integration pack features are defined in the `karaf-features-_VERSION_-features.xml` file. This file (and supporting repositories) is located in http://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/repositories/public, which is already configured for use on Red Hat JBoss Fuse out of the box in `_INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY_/etc/org.ops4j.pax.url.mvn.cfg`.

The file can also be downloaded from either the Red Hat JBoss Fuse product page or {PRODUCT} product page on the Red Hat Customer Portal.

JBossFuse:karaf@root> features:install jbpm-workitems-camel
----


== Configuring Dependencies

When you configure KIE, Red Hat JBoss BRMS, or Red Hat Jboss BPM Suite in your application, you can follow one of the following approaches to build your OSGi application bundles:

* Bundle required dependencies into your application bundle. In this approach, you declare all required artifacts as runtime dependencies in your `pom.xml`. Hence, you need not import the packages that provide these artifacts that you have already added as dependencies.
* Import the required dependencies into the application bundle. This is a preferred approach for building OSGi bundles as it adheres to the principles of OSGi framework. In this approach, you declare only the  API JARs (such as `org.kie:kie-api`) as dependencies in your application bundle. You will need to install the required Red Hat JBoss BRMS and Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite bundles and then import them in your application.

[WARNING]
====
The [class]``MVELUserGroupCallback`` class fails to initialize in an OSGi environment. Do _not_ use or include [class]``MVELUserGroupCallback`` as it is not designed for production purposes.
