Created as a web deployable WAR file, this server can be deployed on any web container. The current version of the {KIE_SERVER} is included with default extensions for both Red Hat JBoss BRMS and Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite.

This server has a low footprint with minimal memory consumption and therefore can be deployed easily on a cloud instance. Each instance of this server can open and instantiate multiple KIE containers which allows you to execute multiple rule services in parallel.

You can provision the {KIE_SERVER} instances through Business Central. In this chapter, the steps required to set up the {KIE_SERVER}, provision and connect to the server through Business Central, control what artifacts go in each instance, and go through its lifecycle are provided.

NOTE: For more information, see the {URL_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE}#intelligent_process_server_and_realtime_decision_server[Intelligent Process Server and Realtime Decision Server] chapter of the _{DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE}_.

[id='_deploying_the_realtime_decision_server']
== Deploying {KIE_SERVER}

The {KIE_SERVER} is distributed as a web application archive (WAR) file `kie-execution-server.war`. When you install {PRODUCT}, deploy the `kie-execution-server.war` file for full functionality. For information about how to deploy the {KIE_SERVER}, see the {INSTALLATION_GUIDE}.

After deploying the {KIE_SERVER}:

. Create a user with the role `kie-server` in the web container. 
. Verify that you can access the decision engine: open `http://__SERVER__:__PORT__/kie-execution-server/services/rest/server/` in a web browser and enter the user name and the password specified in the previous step.
. Once authenticated, an XML response in the form of engine status opens:

== Installing {KIE_SERVER} in Other Containers

[id='_decision_server_tomcat']
=== Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.__X__/3.__X__, Tomcat 8.__X__/9.__X__

Use the following procedure to install the {KIE_SERVER} in a Tomcat container.

. Follow the steps described in section
ifdef::BA[]
{URL_INSTALLATION_GUIDE}#sect_the_generic_deployable_bundle_installation[Generic Deployable Bundle Installation]
endif::BA[]
ifdef::DM[]
{URL_INSTALLATION_GUIDE}#installing_jboss_brms_on_jboss_ews_2[Installing Red Hat JBoss BRMS on Red Hat JBoss Web Server]
endif::DM[]
of _{INSTALLATION_GUIDE}_ to download and extract the generic deployable archive containing `kie-execution-server.war`.

. Configure users and roles. Make sure that the `__TOMCAT_HOME__/conf/tomcat-users.xml` file contains the following role and user definition. The user name and password should be unique, however, the role must be defined as `kie-server`:
+
[source,xml]
----
<role rolename="kie-server"/>
<user username="serveruser" password="my.s3cr3t.pass" roles="kie-server"/>
----

. Start the server: run `__TOMCAT_HOME__/bin/startup.sh` or in a Windows system `__TOMCAT_HOME__/bin/startup.bat`. To make sure that the application was deployed successfully, see Tomcat logs in the `__TOMCAT_HOME__/logs` directory. See <<_bootstrap_switches>> for the list of bootstrap switches that can be used to properly configure the instance. For example:
+
[source]
----
$ ./startup.sh -Dorg.kie.server.id=first-kie-server -Dorg.kie.server.location=http://localhost:8080/kie-execution-server/services/rest/server
----

. To verify that the server is running, open `http://__SERVER__:__PORT__/kie-execution-server/services/rest/server/` in a web browser and enter the user name and the password specified before. You should see a simple XML message with basic information about the server.

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is not possible to use the JMS interface if the {KIE_SERVER} was installed on Tomcat or any other web container. The web container version of the WAR file contains only the REST interface.

|`true`, `false`
|`false`
|Instructs the {KIE_SERVER} to hold the deployment until the controller provides the containers deployment configuration. This property affects only the servers running in managed mode. The options are as follows:

* `false`; the connection to the controller is asynchronous. The application starts, connects to the controller, and once successful, deploys the containers. The application accepts requests even before the containers are available.
* `true`; the deployment of the server application joins the controller connection thread with the main deployment and awaits its completion. This option can lead to a potential deadlock in case more applications are on the same server instance. It is strongly recommended to use only one application (the server) on one server instance.
|===

[id='_managed_decision_server']
=== Managed {KIE_SERVER}

A managed instance requires an available controller to start the {KIE_SERVER}.  

A controller manages the {KIE_SERVER} configuration in a centralized way. Each controller can manage multiple configurations at once, and there can be multiple controllers in the environment.
Managed {KIE_SERVER} can be configured with a list of controllers, but will only connect to one at a time.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Controllers should be synchronized to ensure that the same set of configuration is provided to the server, regardless of the controller to which it connects.
====


When the {KIE_SERVER} is configured with a list of controllers, it will attempt to connect to each of them at startup until a connection is successfully established with one of them.
If a connection cannot be established, the server will not start, even if there is a local storage available with configuration.
This ensures consistence and prevents the server from running with redundant configuration.

[NOTE]
====
To run the {KIE_SERVER} in standalone mode without connecting to controllers, see <<_unmanaged_decision_server>>.

=== Configuring {KIE_SERVER} Managed by Business Central

WARNING: This section provides a sample setup that you can use for testing purposes. Some of the values are unsuitable for a production environment, and are marked as such.

Configure the Business Central to manage {A_KIE_SERVER} instance by performing the following steps:

.Configuring {KIE_SERVER} Managed by Business Central
. Make sure users with the following roles exist:
+
--
* In Business Central, a user with the role `rest-all`.
* On the {KIE_SERVER}, a user with the role `kie-server`.

NOTE: In production environments, use two distinct users, each with one role. In this sample situation, we use only one user named `controllerUser` that has both the `rest-all` and the `kie-server` roles.

If such users do not exist, create them. 

* On Red Hat JBoss EAP, go to `_EAP_HOME_/bin/` and execute:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ ./add-user.sh -a --user controllerUser --password controllerUser1234; --role kie-server,rest-all

[id='_unmanaged_decision_server']
=== Unmanaged {KIE_SERVER}

An unmanaged {KIE_SERVER} is a standalone instance, and therefore must be configured individually using REST/JMS API from the {KIE_SERVER} itself. There is no controller involved. The configuration is automatically persisted by the server into a file and that is used as the internal server state, in case of restarts.

The configuration is updated during the following operations:

* Deploy KIE Container
* Undeploy KIE Container
* Start KIE Container
* Stop KIE Container


[NOTE]
====
If the {KIE_SERVER} is restarted, it will attempt to re-establish the same state that was persisted before shutdown.
Therefore, KIE Containers that were running will be started, but the ones that were stopped will not.
====

ifdef::BA[]
=== Unified Execution Servers

Since {PRODUCT} version 6.4, it is possible to configure both Business Central and the {KIE_SERVER} to use the same data source. This enables you to work with your processes using both applications. In such a setup, it is recommended to use Business Central for operations that require a graphical user interface and the {KIE_SERVER} for all remote calls.

When configuring unified execution servers, the {KIE_SERVER} must be managed by Business Central according to <<_managed_decision_server>>, and the following system properties need to be set:

* On Red Hat JBoss EAP, modify the `<system-properties>` section in:
** `_EAP_HOME_/standalone/configuration/standalone*.xml` for standalone mode.
** `_EAP_HOME_/domain/configuration/domain.xml` for domain mode.
* On Red Hat JBoss Web Server, see <<_decision_server_tomcat>>.
* On IBM WebSphere Application Server, see the {URL_IBM_GUIDE}#add_custom_jvm_properties[Adding Custom JVM Properties] section of the _{IBM_GUIDE}_.
* On Oracle WebLogic Server, see the {URL_ORACLE_GUIDE}#setting_environment_variables[Setting Environment Variables] section of the _{ORACLE_GUIDE}_.

[id='_creating_a_container']
== Creating Containers

Once the {KIE_SERVER} is registered, you can start adding containers. Containers are self-contained environments that have been provisioned to hold instances of your packaged and deployed rule instances.

To create a container:

. Log in to Business Central.
. In the main menu on the top, click *Deploy* -> *Execution Servers*.
. Select your server from the *SERVER TEMPLATES* section on the left side of the page.
. Click *Add Container* in the *KIE CONTAINERS* section.
+
The *New Container* dialog window opens.
. Enter a name of your container and search for the project you want to deploy in the container. Click *Select* next to the project to automatically enter the project's details.
+
Alternatively, you can enter *Group Name*, *Artifact Id*, and *Version* manually.
+
[WARNING]
====
When entering the container's version number, do _not_ use the `LATEST` or `RELEASE` keywords. This feature has been deprecated and can cause deployment issues.
====
. Click *Next* to configure the runtime strategy, `KieBase`, `KieSession`, and merge mode for your container. You can skip this step.
. Click *Finish*.

After the container is successfully created, click *Start* at the upper right hand corner to start it.

== Managing Containers

Containers within the {KIE_SERVER} can be started, stopped, and updated from Business Central.

=== Starting, Stopping, and Deleting Containers

A container is stopped by default. To start the container:

. Log in to Business Central.
. In the main menu on the top, click *Deploy* -> *Execution Servers*.
. Select your server from the *SERVER TEMPLATES* section on the left side of the page.
. Find the container you want to start under the *KIE CONTAINERS* section on the left.
. Click *Start* at the upper right hand corner.
+
Alternatively, click *Stop* to stop a running container. Once a container is stopped, you can click *Remove* to remove it.

=== Upgrading Containers

It is possible to update deployed containers without restarting the {KIE_SERVER}, which can be used in cases where business rule changes cause new versions of packages to be provisioned. You can have multiple versions of the same package provisioned and deployed.

To upgrade a container:

. Log in to Business Central.
. In the main menu on the top, click *Deploy* -> *Execution Servers*.
. Select your server from the *SERVER TEMPLATES* section on the left side of the page.
. Find the container you want to upgrade under the *KIE CONTAINERS* section on the left.
. Click on the *Version Configuration* tab at the top.
. Enter a new version and click *Upgrade*.
+
Optionally, if you want a deployed container to always have the latest version of your deployment without manually editing it, set the *Version* value to *LATEST* and click *Scan Now*. If a newer version of a container deployment is found in the repository during the scanning, the container is automatically upgraded to this newer version. To start the scanner in the background, click *Start Scanner* and specify a scan interval in milliseconds.
+
The *Version* value can be set to *LATEST* if you are creating a deployment for the first time.

=== Managing Multiple Containers

The {KIE_SERVER} allows you to create and provision multiple containers.

Select your server under the *REMOTE SERVERS* section to view all containers and their statuses.

.Managing Multiple Containers

ifdef::BA[]
== Accessing Runtime Data from Business Central

The `Process Instances`, `Tasks`, and `Process & Task Dashboard` pages of Business Central allow you to view the runtime data of the Intelligent Process Server. These runtime pages use the credentials of the currently logged in user to load data from the Intelligent Process Server. Therefore, to be able to view the runtime data on Business Central, ensure that the following conditions are met:

* The user exists in the container running the Business Central application. This user must have `admin`, `analyst`, or `developer` roles assigned, in addition to the `kie-server` role, with full access to the runtime data.
