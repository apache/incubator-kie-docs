ifdef::BA[]
Business Rules, Process definition files, and other assets and resources created in {CENTRAL} are stored in Asset repository, which is otherwise known as the Knowledge Store.
endif::BA[]



The Knowledge Store is a centralized repository for your business knowledge including all business rules, resources,  and other assets created in {CENTRAL}. This asset repository connects to the Git repository to store the assets and artifacts at a single location. 

The Project Explorer in {CENTRAL} enables you to view and update the stored content. Within the Knowledge Store, all business assets are stored in repositories. These repositories are then saved in directories called organizational units. By default, the Knowledge Store in {CENTRAL} does not contain any organizational unit. Therefore, to be able to create your own business assets, you need to create an organizational unit and a repository first.
