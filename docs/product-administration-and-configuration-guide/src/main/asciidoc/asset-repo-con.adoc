The Knowledge Store is a centralized repository for your business knowledge. The Knowledge Store connects to the Git repository to store various knowledge assets and artifacts at a single location. {CENTRAL} provides a web front-end that allows you to view and update the stored content. You can access the content by using the Project Explorer from the unified environment of {PRODUCT}.

All business assets are stored in repositories. These repositories are then saved in directories called organizational units. By default, the Knowledge Store in {CENTRAL} does not contain any organizational unit. Therefore, to be able to create your own business assets, you need to create an organizational unit and a repository first.
