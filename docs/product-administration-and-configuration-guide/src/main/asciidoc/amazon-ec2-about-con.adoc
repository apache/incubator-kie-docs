= About Amazon EC2 

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides a computing environment in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud. Deploying {PRODUCT} to Amazon EC2 has been supported since version 6.2.

You can use Amazon EC2 to create a virtual machine and its computing environments, called instances. Templates for these instances are then known as Amazon Machine Images (AMIs). The service enables you to modify the instance to use a required configuration of CPU, memory, storage, and other properties. The cost of the service is calculated based on the used compute capacity.

For more information about Amazon EC2 and the provided features, see the  http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/[AWS Documentation].
