= Managing deployment descriptors

Deployment descriptors can be configured in {CENTRAL} in *Menu* -> *Design* -> *$PROJECT_NAME* -> *Settings* -> *Deployments*.

Every time a project is created, a stock `kie-deployment-descriptor.xml` file is generated with default values.

It is not necessary to provide a full deployment descriptor for all KJARs. Providing partial deployment descriptors is possible and recommended. For example, if you need to use a different audit mode, you can specify that for the KJAR only, all other properties will have the default value defined at the server level.

When using `OVERRIDE_ALL` merge mode, all configuration items must be specified, because the relevant KJAR will always use specified configuration and will not merge with any other deployment descriptor in the hierarchy.

== Managing Deployment Override Policy

If a user tries to deploy an artifact with a GAV (Group-Id, Artifact-Id and Version) that already exists in the system, the deployment will fail and an error message will be displayed in the *Messages* panel.

This feature prevents the user from overwriting an existing deployment by mistake.

By default this feature is enabled, that is, by default the system will prevent the user from overwriting an existing installation with the same GAV.

However, there may be cases when the user _may_ want to overwrite existing deployments with the same GAV. Although you cannot enable overwriting on a per-deployment basis, you can set this up for the system as a whole by using the system setting [property]``org.kie.override.deploy.enabled``. This setting, is `false` by default. Change it to `true` to enable overwriting of deployments with the same GAV by providing it at startup time of your server (``-Dorg.kie.override.deploy.enabled=true``).
