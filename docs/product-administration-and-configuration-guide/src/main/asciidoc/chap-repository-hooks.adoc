= Repository Hooks

In Business Central, it is possible to trigger a chosen action every time a particular event happens. For this purpose, you can configure the repository to use scripts called hooks.


== Configuring Git Hooks

Business Central can automatically push changes to a remote repository using the Git hooks. Git hooks support has been introduced with the release of {PRODUCT} 6.2.0.

[NOTE]
====
Please note that currently only the `post-commit` hook is supported. `Post-commit` hooks are triggered after finishing the entire commit process.
====

The following procedure shows how to configure the `post-commit` hook to automatically push your changes to the remote repository.

. In Business Central, go to *Authoring* -> *Administration*.
. Below the main menu, click *Repositories* -> *Clone repository*.
. In the displayed *Clone repository* dialog box, fill in the repository information:
+
--
* Repository Name
* Organizational Unit
* Git URL: For example `https://_github_.com/_USERNAME_/_REPOSITORY_NAME_.git`
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
It is important to use the HTTPS or Git protocol instead of a SCP-style SSH URL. Business Central does not support the basic SSH URL and fails with __Invalid URL format__.
====
+
.An invalid SCP-style SSH URL.

+
* User Name: your Git user name
* Password: your Git password
--
+

. Change to the created repository:
+
[source]
----
cd JBOSS_HOME/bin/.niogit/REPOSITORY_NAME.git
----

. Change the remote URL:
+
--
[source]
----
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:USERNAME/REPOSITORY_NAME.git
----

Make sure that you can access the remote repository through command line using SSH. For example, the private SSH key for the repository should exist under the `~/.ssh/` directory.

If you created a new repository, you may encounter the following error:

[source]
----
fatal: No such remote 'origin'
----

To resolve it, add the remote origin URL:

[source]
----
git remote add origin git@github.com:USERNAME/REPOSITORY_NAME.git
----
--

. Verify that the remote repository was successfully added:
+
--
[source]
----
git remote -v
----

The command should list the following:

[source]
----
origin  git@github.com:USERNAME/REPOSITORY_NAME.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:USERNAME/REPOSITORY_NAME.git (push)
----
--
+

. Create a file named `post-commit` with the permissions set to `rwxr\--r--` under `JBOSS_HOME/bin/.niogit/REPOSITORY_NAME.git/hooks` with the following content:
+
[source]
----
#!/bin/sh
git push origin master
----

. Make sure that the configuration was successful by creating a new guided rule in Business Central:
.. Go to *Authoring* -> *Project Authoring* -> *New Item* -> *Guided Rule*.
.. Fill in the required information in the displayed *Create new Guided Rule* window.
.. Click *Ok*.

All of the changes should be pushed automatically.


For further information about remote Git repositories, see https://access.redhat.com/solutions/1281493[How to configure the BxMS 6 server to use a remote Git repository for storing assets?].

It is also possible to specify the system property ``org.uberfire.nio.git.hooks``. Its value determines a directory with default hook files, which will be copied to the newly created Git repositories. See the example of a `standalone.xml` file with this setting below:

[source]
----
<system-properties>
  <property name="org.uberfire.nio.git.hooks" value="/opt/jboss-as/git-hooks">
  </property>
  ...
</system-properties>
