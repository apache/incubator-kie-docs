= Importing a Public Key
Before creating or starting an Amazon Web Services (AWS) instance, you must import your public key to AWS to be able to connect to the instance.

.Procedure
. In AWS, in the main menu on the left, click *Key Pairs* under the *NETWORK & SECURITY* menu.
. Click *Import Key Pair* at the top of the page.
+
The *Import Key Pair* dialog window opens.

. Define the name of the key pair and either upload the public key from file, or copy and paste the content of your public key into the *Public key contents* text field.
. Click *Import*.
+
The imported key pair appears in the displayed list of key pairs.

Alternatively, you can create your own key pair using Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2). For more information, see the http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html[Amazon EC2 Key Pairs] chapter in the _AWS Documentation_.
