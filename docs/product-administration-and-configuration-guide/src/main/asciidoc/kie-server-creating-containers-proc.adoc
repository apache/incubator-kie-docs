.Procedure
. Log in to {CENTRAL}.
. In the main menu, click *Menu* -> *DevOps* -> *Execution Servers*.
. Click *SERVER TEMPLATES* -> *+ New Server Template*.
. In the *New Server Template* window, click *Container*.
. Enter the *Group Name*, *Artifact Id*, and *Version* manually.
+ 
Alternatively, enter the name of your container and search for the project you want to deploy in the container.

. Click *Select* next to the project to automatically enter the details of the project.

[WARNING]
====
When entering the container's version number, do _not_ use the `LATEST` or `RELEASE` keywords. This feature has been deprecated and can cause deployment issues.
