= Creating Containers

Once the {KIE_SERVER} is registered, you can start adding containers. Containers are self-contained environments that have been provisioned to hold instances of your packaged and deployed rule instances.

To create a container:

. Log in to Business Central.
. In the main menu on the top, click *Deploy* -> *Execution Servers*.
. Select your server from the *SERVER TEMPLATES* section on the left side of the page.
. Click *Add Container* in the *KIE CONTAINERS* section.
+
The *New Container* dialog window opens.
. Enter a name of your container and search for the project you want to deploy in the container. Click *Select* next to the project to automatically enter the project's details.
+
Alternatively, you can enter *Group Name*, *Artifact Id*, and *Version* manually.
+
[WARNING]
====
When entering the container's version number, do _not_ use the `LATEST` or `RELEASE` keywords. This feature has been deprecated and can cause deployment issues.
====
. Click *Next* to configure the runtime strategy, `KieBase`, `KieSession`, and merge mode for your container. You can skip this step.
. Click *Finish*.

After the container is successfully created, click *Start* at the upper right hand corner to start it.

To verify that the container is running, send a [GET] request to the endpoint.
