endif::DM[]

The Knowledge Store is a centralized repository for your business knowledge. The Knowledge Store connects to the Git repository to store various knowledge assets and artifacts at a single location. Business Central provides a web front-end that allows you to view and update the stored content. You can access the content by using the Project Explorer from the unified environment of {PRODUCT}.

All business assets are stored in repositories. These repositories are then saved in directories called organizational units. By default, the Knowledge Store in Business Central does not contain any organizational unit. Therefore, to be able to create your own business assets, you need to create an organizational unit and a repository first.

== Creating an Organizational Unit

It is possible to create an organizational unit either in the *Administration* page of Business Central or the REST API calls.

[id='_managing_assets']
== Managing Assets

[NOTE]
====
To activate and use the feature described below, login to Business Central with a user that has the ``kiemgmt`` role assigned.
====

To make management of projects easier, {PRODUCT} now provides a way to manage multiple projects based on standards. This allows you to create repository structures using industry standard best practices for maintenance, versioning and distribution of your projects.

To start with, repositories can now be managed or unmanaged.


[float]
=== Managed and Unmanaged Repositories

Unmanaged Repositories are the repository structures that you are used to. They can contain multiple unrelated projects.

Managed Repositories, on the other hand, provide version control at the project level and project branches for managing the release cycle. Further, Managed Repositories can be restricted to just a single project or encompass multiple projects. When you create a Managed Repository, the asset management configuration process is automatically launched in order to create the repository branches. Corresponding project structure is created as well.

.Procedure: Creating an Unmanaged Repository
. In Business Central, go to *Authoring* -> *Administration*.
. Click *Repositories* -> *New Repository*.
+
The *New Repository* window is displayed.

. Enter the repository name and select an organizational unit the repository belongs to.
. Click *Finish*.

.Procedure: Creating a Managed Repository
. In Business Central, go to *Authoring* -> *Administration*.
. Click *Repositories* -> *New Repository*.
+
The *New Repository* window is displayed.

. Enter the repository name and select an organizational unit the repository belongs to.
. Select the *Managed Repository* check box and click *Next* to enter additional details of the Managed Repository.
+
image::6565.png[]

. Choose either the *Single-project Repository* or the *Multi-project Repository* radio button.
+
--
If the project you are creating is simple and self-contained, select the *Single-project Repository* radio button.
Note that you will not be able to add more projects to this repository later.

For more complex projects, where there is likely to be a parent project that encompasses smaller ones, select the *Multi-project Repository* radio button.

image::6566.png[]
--
+

. Enter the details of the managed project along with the GAV (Group, Artifact, Version) details.
+
Note that all projects created in a *Multi-project Repository* will be managed together, with their version numbers being incremented together as well.
Details of the parent project will be inherited by all future projects that you create in this Managed Repository.
. Click *Finish* .


[float]
=== Managed Branches

With Managed Repositories comes the added advantage of Managed Branches. As in Git, you can choose to work on different branches of your project (for example: master, dev and release). This process of branching can also be automated for you, by selecting the checkbox while creating a new Managed Repository (for both single and multi-projects).

You can switch between branches by selecting the desired branch while working in the Project Explorer.


[float]
=== Repository Structure

If you do not select automatic branch management while creating a repository, you can create branches manually afterwards. For Managed Repositories, you can do so by using the *Configure* button. This button, along with *Promote* and *Release* buttons, is provided in the *Repository Structure* view. You can access this view, by clicking on *Repository* -> *Repository Structure* in the Project Explorer page menu.

Clicking on the *Configure* button allows you to create branches or edit automatically created ones.

image::6572.png[]

You can promote assets from the master branch to other branches using the *Promote* button. Similarly, you can Release branches and deploy them on the server using the *Release* button.

Both these functions are controlled internally by the use of pre-defined processes that are deployed on your instance. For example, when you click on *Promote* button after having done work on your development branch, a Promote Changes process is started in the background. A user, with the role of `kiemgmt` will have a user task appear in this task list to review the assets being promoted. This user can claim this task, and decide to promote all, some or none of the assets. The underlying process will cherry-pick the commits selected by the user to a release branch. This user can also request another review of these assets and this process can be repeated multiple times till all the assets are ready for release. The flow for this process is shown below:

image::6574.png[]

Similarly, when you click on the *Release* button, a release process flow is initiated. This process flow builds the project and updates all the Maven artifacts to the next version, and deploys the project to the runtime, if runtime deployment details are supplied.

[WARNING]
====
Project branches to be released must start with the keyword ``release``.
====

image::6575.png[]


ifdef::DM[]
[WARNING]
====
Do not use *Deploy To Runtime* with Red Hat JBoss BRMS as it causes deploy failure. This function can only be used with Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite.
====
endif::DM[]


[id='_maven_repository']
== Maven Repository

Maven is a software project management tool which uses a project object model (POM) file to manage:

* Builds
* Documentation
* Reporting
* Dependencies
* Releases
* SCMs
* Distribution

A Maven repository is used to hold or store the build artifacts and project dependencies and is generally of two types:

Local::
Refers to a local repository where all the project dependencies are stored and is located with the current installation in the default folder as "m2". It is a cache of the remote downloads, and also contains the temporary build artifacts which have not yet been released.
Remote::
Refers to any other type of repository that can be accessed by a variety of protocols such as `file://` or `http://`. These repositories can be at a remote location set up by a third-party for downloading of artifacts or an internal repository set up on a file or HTTP server, used to share private artifacts between the development teams for managing internal releases.


[id='_configuring_deployment_to_a_remote_nexus_repository']
== Configuring Deployment to a Remote Nexus Repository

Nexus is a repository manager frequently used in organizations to centralize storage and management of software development artifacts. It is possible to configure your project so that artifacts produced by every build are automatically deployed to a repository on a remote Nexus server.

To configure your project to deploy artifacts to a remote Nexus repository, add a `distributionManagement` element to your project's `pom.xml` file as demonstrated in the code example below.

[source,xml]
----
<distributionManagement>
  <repository>
    <id>deployment</id>
    <name>Internal Releases</name>
    <url>http://your_nexus_host:8081/nexus/content/repositories/releases</url>
  </repository>
  <snapshotRepository>
    <id>deployment</id>
    <name>Internal Releases</name>
    <url>http://your_nexus_host:8081/nexus/content/repositories/snapshots/</url>
  </snapshotRepository>
</distributionManagement>
----

Replace the URLs in the example with real URLs of your Nexus repositories. The repository specified in the `snapshotRepository` element is used when the `-SNAPSHOT` qualifier is appended to the project's current version number. In other cases the repository specified in the `repository` element is used.

If your Nexus server requires authentication, you will also need to modify your projects Maven settings to add your credentials in the `settings-security.xml` file, using a master password. By default, this file is in the `$M2_HOME/conf` folder, unless you have changed its location by modifying the `kie.maven.settings.custom` system property. It is also possible to create new user-specific `settings.xml` and `settings-security.xml` files in the `~/.m2` folder. In that case, these files will override the original ones.

See the following example of the `settings-security.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<servers>
  <server>
    <id>deployment</id>
    <username>admin</username>
    <password>{COQLCE6DU6GtcS5P=}</password>
  </server>
</servers>
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Note that keeping your server authentication credentials (for example the passwords) as a plain text in the `settings.xml` file is _not_ recommended. All the information should be hashed with a master password in the `settings-security.xml` file.

For further information about password encryption and creating a master password, see the Apache Maven documentation, article https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-encryption.html[Password Encryption].
====

With this configuration in place, clicking the *Build & Deploy* button in Business Central executes a Maven build and deploys the built artifacts both to the local repository and to one of the Nexus repositories specified in the `pom.xml` file.
