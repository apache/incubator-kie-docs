=== Managed {KIE_SERVER}

A managed instance requires an available controller to start the {KIE_SERVER}.  

A controller manages the {KIE_SERVER} configuration in a centralized way. Each controller can manage multiple configurations at once, and there can be multiple controllers in the environment.
Managed {KIE_SERVER} can be configured with a list of controllers, but will only connect to one at a time.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Controllers should be synchronized to ensure that the same set of configuration is provided to the server, regardless of the controller to which it connects.
====


When the {KIE_SERVER} is configured with a list of controllers, it will attempt to connect to each of them at startup until a connection is successfully established with one of them.
If a connection cannot be established, the server will not start, even if there is a local storage available with configuration.
This ensures consistence and prevents the server from running with redundant configuration.

[NOTE]
====
To run the {KIE_SERVER} in standalone mode without connecting to controllers, see <<_unmanaged_decision_server>>.
