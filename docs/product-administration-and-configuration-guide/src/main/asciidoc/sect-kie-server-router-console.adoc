= The Intelligent Process Server Router Management Console

The Intelligent Process Server router integrates Business Central with the Intelligent Process Server or servers, so that its runtime views, such as process instances, definitions, and tasks, can be used with Intelligent Process Server as the back end. The Management Console aggregates server data into single view tables for a complete overview of process instance operations. 

The workbench recognizes the router as a regular server and therefore makes the same features available, such as starting processes and working with user tasks. 

[NOTE]
====
Though the router behaves similarly to an Intelligent Process Server from a workbench point of view, it does not allow you to perform management operations such as creating or upgrading containers. These operations should continue to be managed independently.
