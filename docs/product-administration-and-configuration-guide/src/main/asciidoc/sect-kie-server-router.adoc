= Intelligent Process Server Router 

The {KIE_SERVER} promotes architecture where there are many server instances responsible for running individual projects (KJARs). These instances can be completely independent or related domains, but they must be separated on different runtimes to avoid negatively impacting each other. The client application must be aware of all servers, including their location (URL), to properly interact with them. However, knowing the location of available containers is problematic, particularly in dynamic (cloud) environments where server availability is based on various conditions. 

To solve this issue, the {KIE_SERVER} router is able to bridge all available servers and group them to provide a unified view of them as a single client application. The router then exposes most of the capabilities of the {KIE_SERVER} over HTTP. 

The {KIE_SERVER} router comes in two pieces:

* A proxy that acts like a server
* A client that is included in the {KIE_SERVER} to integrate with the proxy

The router client combines with the server life cycle and sends notifications to the Intelligent Process Server router when a configuration is changed. You can perform all standard operations using the router, which decides to what server the request should be forwarded. These include the following:

* Starting processes that are executed on different servers and on different machines.
* Retrieving various information such as active instances, process instance images, and working with tasks.
* Aggregating results for queries (process instance, process definition, or tasks), so there is no need to check individual servers for running instances and obtain their details.
* Accessing the dashboard.

The router has two primary responsibilities:

* To be a proxy to the actual {KIE_SERVER} instance based on contextual information, such as container ID or alias.
* To provide an aggregation of data by collecting information from all distinct server instances in single client request.

There are two types of requests Intelligent Process Server Router supports from the client perspective:

* *Modification requests*: `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, HTTP methods.
+
Modification requests must include the container ID (or alias) in the URL for proxy purposes.
* *Retrieval requests*: `GET` HTTP method.
+
When retrieval requests are made and include a container ID, they are handled the same way as modification requests.
