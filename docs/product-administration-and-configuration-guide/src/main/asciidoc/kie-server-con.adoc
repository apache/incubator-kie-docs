Created as a web deployable WAR file, this server can be deployed on any web container. The current version of the {KIE_SERVER} is included with default extensions for both {PRODUCT_DM} and {PRODUCT_BA}.

This server has a low footprint with minimal memory consumption and therefore can be deployed easily on a cloud instance. Each instance of this server can open and instantiate multiple KIE containers, which allows you to execute multiple rule services in parallel.

You can provision the {KIE_SERVER} instances through {CENTRAL}. 

////
In this chapter, the steps required to set up the {KIE_SERVER}, provision and connect to the server through {CENTRAL}, control what artifacts go in each instance, and go through its lifecycle are provided.
