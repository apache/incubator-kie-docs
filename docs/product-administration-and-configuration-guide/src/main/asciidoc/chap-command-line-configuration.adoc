= Command Line Configuration

The `kie-config-cli` tool is a command line configuration tool that provides capabilities to manage the system repository from the command line and can be used in an online or offline mode.

Online mode (default and recommended)::
On startup, the tool connects to a Git repository using a Git server provided by `kie-wb`. All changes are made locally and published to upstream only after explicitly executing the push-changes command. Use the exit command to publish local changes. To discard local changes on exit, use the discard command.
Offline mode (installer style)::
+
Creates and manipulates the system repository directly on the server (there is no discard option).

The tool is available on the https://access.redhat.com[Red Hat Customer Portal]. To download the `kie-config-cli` tool, do the following:

== Starting the kie-config-cli Tool in Online Mode

. To start the `kie-config-cli` tool in online mode, navigate to the `kie-config-cli-6.MINOR_VERSION-redhat-x-dist` directory where you installed the tool and then execute the following command.
. In a Unix environment run:
+
--
[source]
----
./kie-config-cli.sh
----

In a Windows environment run:

[source]
----
./kie-config-cli.bat
----
--

By default, the tool starts in online mode and asks for user credentials and a Git URL to connect to (the default value is `git://localhost/system`). To connect to a remote server, replace the host and port with appropriate values.

Example: `git://kie-wb-host:9148/system`


[[_starting_the_kie_config_cli_tool_in_offline_mode]]
== Starting the kie-config-cli Tool in Offline Mode

To operate in offline mode, append the offline parameter to the command as below.

. Navigate to the `kie-config-cli-6.MINOR_VERSION-redhat-x-dist` directory where you installed the tool.
. In a Unix environment, run:
+
--
[source]
----
./kie-config-cli.sh offline
----

In a Windows environment, run:

----
./kie-config-cli.bat offline
----
--

Executing this command changes the tool's behaviour and displays a request to specify the folder where the system repository (`.niogit`) is located. If .niogit does not yet exist, the folder value can be left empty and a brand new setup is created.
