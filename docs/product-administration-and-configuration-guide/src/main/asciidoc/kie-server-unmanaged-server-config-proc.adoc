[id='kie-server-unmanaged-server-config-proc']
= Unmanaged {KIE_SERVER}

An unmanaged {KIE_SERVER} is a standalone instance, and therefore must be configured individually using REST/JMS API from the {KIE_SERVER} itself. There is no controller involved. The configuration is automatically persisted by the server into a file and that is used as the internal server state, in case of restarts.

The configuration is updated during the following operations:

* Deploy KIE Container
* Undeploy KIE Container
* Start KIE Container
* Stop KIE Container

[NOTE]
====
If the {KIE_SERVER} is restarted, it will attempt to re-establish the same state that was persisted before shutdown.
Therefore, KIE Containers that were running will be started, but the ones that were stopped will not.
