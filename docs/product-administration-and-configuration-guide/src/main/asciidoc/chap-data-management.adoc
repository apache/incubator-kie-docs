[id='_data_backups']
== Data Backups

When applying a backup mechanism to {PRODUCT}, ensure you back up the following resources:

* Any customized deployment descriptors (such as, `web.xml`, `jboss-web.xml`, `jboss.xml`).
* Any customized properties files.
+
[NOTE]
====
Consider backing up the entire `business-central.war` and `dashbuilder.war` files.
====

* The `_JBOSS-HOME_/bin/.niogit` folder. This directory contains Git repositories that Business Central manages internally to store project and configuration data.
+
[NOTE]
====
The location of the `.niogit` directory may be different based on your configuration. See <<org.uberfire.nio.git.dir, the `org.uberfire.nio.git.dir` system property>>.

[id='_indexing_foreign_keys']
== Setup Indexes

[float]
=== Setup Foreign Key Indexes

Some databases, for instance Oracle and PostgreSQL, do not automatically create an index for each foreign key. This can result in deadlocks occurring. To avoid this situation, it is necessary to create an index on all foreign keys, especially in the Oracle database.

[float]
=== Setup Indexes for Process and Task Dashboard

Process and Task Dashboard in 6.1 has been refactored in order to cope with high volume of task and process instances. In order to get good response times while querying the database the following JBoss BPM Suite tables need to be indexed: `processinstancelog` and ``bamtasksummary``.

Note that _ALL_ the columns in these two tables need to be indexed and not just the primary and foreign keys.
