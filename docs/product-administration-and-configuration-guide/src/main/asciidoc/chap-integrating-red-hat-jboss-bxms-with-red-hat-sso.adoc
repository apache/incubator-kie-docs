= Integrating {PRODUCT} with Red Hat Single Sign-On

Red Hat Single Sign-On (RH-SSO) is a Single Sign-On solution that you can use for securing your browser applications and your REST web services. This chapter describes how you can integrate RH-SSO with {PRODUCT} and leverage its features.

Integrating with RH-SSO brings an integrated SSO and IDM (Identity Management) environment for {PRODUCT}. The session management feature of RH-SSO allows you to use different {PRODUCT} environments on the web by authenticating only once.

For more information on RH-SSO, see the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-single-sign-on/version-7.0/getting-started-guide/[RH-SSO documentation].

== Red Hat Single Sign On Integration Points
You can integrate RH-SSO with {KIE_SERVER}s using the following integration points:

* *Business Central authentication through an RH-SSO server*
+
Authenticating {PRODUCT} Business Central through RH-SSO involves securing both the Business Central web client and remote services through RH-SSO. This integration enables you to connect to Business Central using either web interface or a remote service consumer through RH-SSO.

* *{KIE_SERVER} authentication through an RH-SSO server*
+
Authenticating {PRODUCT} {KIE_SERVER} through RH-SSO involves securing the remote services provided by the {KIE_SERVER} as it does not provide a web interface for server authentication. This enables any remote {PRODUCT} service consumer (user or a service) to authenticate through RH-SSO.

* *Third-party client authentication through an RH-SSO server*
+
Authenticating a third-party client through an RH-SSO server involves third-party clients to authenticate themselves using RH-SSO to consume the remote service endpoints provided by Business Central and {KIE_SERVER}, such as the REST API or remote file system services.

The following sections describe how to achieve RH-SSO integration through these integration points:


== Business Central Authentication through RH-SSO

To authenticate Business Central through RH-SSO:

. Set up and run an RH-SSO server with a realm client for Business Central.
. Install and set up the RH-SSO client adapter for EAP.
. Secure Business Central Remote Service using RH-SSO.
ifdef::BA[]
. Create an RH-SSO client and configure the RH-SSO client adapter for Dashbuilder (BAM).
endif::BA[]


=== Setting Up RH-SSO with Realm Client for Business Central

Security realms are used to restrict access for the different applications resources. It is advised to create a new realm whether your RH-SSO instance is private or shared amongst other products. You can keep the master realm as a place for super administrators to create and manage the realms in your system. If you are integrating with an RH-SSO instance that is shared with other product installations to achieve Single Sign-On with those applications, all those applications must use the same realm.

Here is how you can install an RH-SSO server and create a security realm for Business Central:

.Procedure: Setting Up RH-SSO with Realm Client
. Download RH-SSO from the https://access.redhat.com/jbossnetwork/restricted/listSoftware.html?downloadType=distributions&product=core.service.rhsso&version=7.0[DOWNLOADS] section of the Red Hat Customer Portal.
. Install and configure a basic RH-SSO standalone server. To do this, follow the instructions in chapter https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-single-sign-on/7.0/single/getting-started-guide/#install-boot[Install and Boot] of the _Red Hat Single Sign On Getting Started Guide_. For production environment settings, consult the _Red Hat Single Sign On_ https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-single-sign-on/7.0/single/server-administration-guide/[Server Administration Guide].
+
[NOTE]
====
If you want to run both RH-SSO and {PRODUCT} servers on the same machine, ensure that you avoid port conflicts.
To do so, do one of the following:

* Update the `_RHSSO_HOME_/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml` file and set a port offset to 100. For example:
+
[source]
----
<socket-binding-group name="standard-sockets" default-interface="public" port-offset="${jboss.socket.binding.port-offset:100}">
----

* Use an environment variable to run the server:
+
[source]
----
bin/standalone.sh -Djboss.socket.binding.port-offset=100
----
====

. Start the RH-SSO server using the following command from `_RHSSO_HOME_/bin`:
+
--
[source]
----
./standalone.sh
----

Once the RH-SSO server starts, open http://localhost:8180/auth/admin in a web browser and log in using your admin credentials that you created while installing RH-SSO. When you login for the first time, you can set up the initial user using the new user registration form.
--
+

. In the RH-SSO Admin Console, click the *Realm Settings* left menu item.
. On the *Realm Settings* page, click *Add Realm*.
+
The *Add realm* page opens.

. On the *Add realm* page, provide a name for the realm and click *Create*.
. Click the *Clients* left menu item and click *Create*.
+
The *Add Client* page opens.

. On the *Add Client* page, provide the required information to create a new client for your realm. For example:
* *Client ID*: kie
* *Client protocol*: openid-connect
* *Root URL*: http://_localhost_:8080/business-central

. Click *Save* to save your changes.
+
Once you create a new client, its *Access Type* is set to `public` by default. Change it to `confidential`. 
+
At this point, the RH-SSO server is configured with a realm with a client for {PRODUCT} applications (Business Central, in this example) and running and listening for HTTP connections at [parameter]``localhost:8180``. This realm provides different users, roles, and sessions for the {PRODUCT} applications.


=== Setting Up RH-SSO Client Adapter for EAP

To set up the RH-SSO client adapter for EAP:

. Install the RH-SSO adapter for EAP.
. Configure the {PRODUCT} application and the RH-SSO client adapter.


.Procedure: Installing the RH-SSO Adapter for Red Hat JBoss EAP 6 and 7
. Install Red Hat JBoss EAP 6.4._X_ or 7.0.
+
For version 6, see chapter https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/JBoss_Enterprise_Application_Platform/6.4/html/Installation_Guide/chap-Installation_Instructions.html[Installation Instructions] from the _Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform Installation Guide_.
+
For version 7, see chapter https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-jboss-enterprise-application-platform/7.0/single/installation-guide/#installing_jboss_eap[Installing JBoss EAP] from the _Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform Installation Guide_.
. Install {PRODUCT} in the freshly installed JBoss EAP.
+
If you configure RH-SSO adapter by making changes in `standalone.xml`, and then unzip {PRODUCT}, you may overwrite and lose the RH-SSO adapter configuration.
. Download the EAP adapter from the https://access.redhat.com/jbossnetwork/restricted/listSoftware.html?product=core.service.rhsso&downloadType=distributions[Red Hat Customer Portal].
. Unzip and install the adapter. For installation instructions, see section https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-single-sign-on/7.0/securing-applications-and-services-guide/securing-applications-and-services-guide#jboss_adapter[JBoss EAP Adapter] from the _Red Hat Single Sign On Securing Applications and Services Guide_.
. For version 7, go to `_EAP_HOME_/standalone/configuration` and open the `standalone.xml` and `standalone-full.xml` files. Delete the `<single-sign-on/>` element from both of them.
+
You do not need to perform this step for Red Hat JBoss EAP 6.

.Procedure: Configuring the RH-SSO Adapter
. Navigate to `_EAP_HOME_/standalone/configuration` in your EAP installation and edit `standalone.xml` to add the RH-SSO subsystem configuration. For example:
+
--
[source,xml]
----
<subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:keycloak:1.1">
 <secure-deployment name="business-central.war">
   <realm>demo</realm>
   <realm-public-key>MIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQKBgQCrVrCuTtArbgaZzL1hvh0xtL5mc7o0NqPVnYXkLvgcwiC3BjLGw1tGEGoJaXDuSaRllobm53JBhjx33UNv+5z/UMG4kytBWxheNVKnL6GgqlNabMaFfPLPCF8kAgKnsi79NMo+n6KnSY8YeUmec/p2vjO2NjsSAVcWEQMVhJ31LwIDAQAB</realm-public-key>
   <auth-server-url>http://localhost:8180/auth</auth-server-url>
   <ssl-required>external</ssl-required>
   <enable-basic-auth>true</enable-basic-auth>
   <resource>kie</resource>
   <credential name="secret">759514d0-dbb1-46ba-b7e7-ff76e63c6891</credential>
   <principal-attribute>preferred_username</principal-attribute>
 </secure-deployment>
</subsystem>
----

Here,

* `secure-deployment name`: Name of your application's WAR file.
* `realm`: Name of the realm that you created for the applications to use.
* `realm-public-key`: The public key of the realm you created. You can find the key in the *Keys* tab in the *Realm settings* page of the realm you created in the RH-SSO Admin Console. If you do not provide a value for `realm-public-key`, the server retrieves it automatically.
* `auth-server-url`: The URL for the RH-SSO authentication server.
* `enable-basic-auth`: The setting to enable basic authentication mechanism, so that the clients can use both token-based and basic authentication approaches to perform the requests.
* `resource`: The name for the client that you created.
* `credential name`: The secret key for the client you created. You can find the key in the *Credentials* tab on the *Clients* page of the RH-SSO Admin Console.
* `principal-attribute`: The login name of the user. If you do not provide this value, your User Id is displayed in the application instead of your user name.
+
[NOTE]
====
The RH-SSO server converts the user names to lowercase. Therefore, after integration with RH-SSO, your user name will appear in lowercase in Business Central. If you have user names in upper-case letters hard coded in business processes, the application may not be able to identify the upper-case user.
====
--
+

. Navigate to `_EAP_HOME_/bin/` and start the EAP server using the following command:
+
--
[source]
----
./standalone.sh
----
--

[NOTE]
====
You can also configure RH-SSO adapter for EAP by updating your applications WAR file to use the RH-SSO security subsystem. However, the recommended approach is configuring the adapter through the RH-SSO subsystem. This means that you are updating EAP configuration instead of applying the configuration on each WAR file.
====

[id='_adding_a_new_user']
=== Adding a New User

To add new users and assign them a role to access Business Central:

. Log in to the RH-SSO Admin Console and open the realm to which you wish to add a user.
. Click the *Users* left menu item under the *Manage* section.
+
An empty user list page called *Users* opens.

. Click the *Add User* button on the empty user list to start creating your new user.
+
An *Add user* page opens.

. Provide user information on the *Add user* page and click *Save*.
. Set a new password under the *Credentials* tab.
. Assign the new user one of the roles that allow access to Business Central. For example, 
ifdef::DM[the `admin` or `analyst` role.]
ifdef::BA[`admin` or `developer` role.]
+
Define the roles as realm roles in the *Realm Roles* tab under the *Roles* section.

. Click *Role Mappings* tab on the *Users* page to assign roles.

You can now log in to your {PRODUCT} application (in this example, Business Central) once the server is running using the user credentials you just created. 

=== Securing Business Central Remote Service Using RH-SSO

Business Central provides different remote service endpoints that can be consumed by third-party clients using remote API.
To authenticate those services through RH-SSO, you must disable a security filter called [parameter]``BasicAuthSecurityFilter``.
To do this, follow these steps:

.Procedure: Disabling BasicAuthSecurityFilter
. Open your application deployment descriptor file (`WEB-INF/web.xml`) and apply the following changes to it:
* Remove the following lines to remove the servlet filter and its mapping for class [class]``org.uberfire.ext.security.server.BasicAuthSecurityFilter``:
+
[source,xml]
----
<filter>
  <filter-name>HTTP Basic Auth Filter</filter-name>
  <filter-class>org.uberfire.ext.security.server.BasicAuthSecurityFilter</filter-class>
  <init-param>
    <param-name>realmName</param-name>
    <param-value>KIE Workbench Realm</param-value>
  </init-param>
</filter>

<filter-mapping>
  <filter-name>HTTP Basic Auth Filter</filter-name>
  <url-pattern>/rest/*</url-pattern>
  <url-pattern>/maven2/*</url-pattern>
  <url-pattern>/ws/*</url-pattern>
</filter-mapping>
----

* Add the following lines to add the [parameter]``security-constraint`` for the url-patterns that you have removed from the filter mapping:
+
[source,xml]
----
<security-constraint>
  <web-resource-collection>
    <web-resource-name>remote-services</web-resource-name>
    <url-pattern>/rest/*</url-pattern>
    <url-pattern>/maven2/*</url-pattern>
    <url-pattern>/ws/*</url-pattern>
  </web-resource-collection>
  <auth-constraint>
    <role-name>rest-all</role-name>
  </auth-constraint>
</security-constraint>
----

. Save your changes.

=== Securing Business Central File System Services Using RH-SSO

To consume other remote services, such as file systems (for example, a remote GIT service), you need to specify a correct RH-SSO login module. First, generate a JSON configuration file:

. Navigate to the *RH-SSO Admin Console* located at http://localhost:8080/auth/admin.
. Click the *Clients* left menu item. 
. Create a new client with the following settings:
+
  * Set *Client ID* as `kie-git`.
  * Set *Access Type* as `confidential`.
  * Disable the *Standard Flow Enabled* option.
  * Enable the *Direct Access Grants Enabled* option.
+
image::kie_git_client_settings.png[]
. Click *Save*.
. Click the *Installation* tab at the top of the client configuration screen and choose *Keycloak OIDC JSON* as a *Format Option*.
. Click *Download*.
. Move the downloaded JSON file to an accessible directory in the server's file system or add it to the application class path.
+
For more information, see chapter https://keycloak.gitbooks.io/securing-client-applications-guide/content/v/2.2/topics/oidc/java/jaas.html[JAAS plugin] of the Keycloak _Securing Applications and Services Guide_.


After you successfuly generate and download the JSON configuration file, specify the correct RH-SSO login module in the `_EAP_HOME_/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml` file. By default, the security domain in Business Central is set to `other`. Replace the default values of the `login-module` in this security domain with the ones presented in the example below:

[source,xml]
----
<security-domain name="other" cache-type="default">
  <authentication>
    <login-module code="org.keycloak.adapters.jaas.DirectAccessGrantsLoginModule" flag="required">
      <module-option name="keycloak-config-file" value="$EAP_HOME/kie-git.json"/>
    </login-module>
  </authentication>
</security-domain>
----

The JSON file specified in the `module-option` element contains a client used for securing the remote services. Replace the `$_EAP_HOME_/kie-git.json` value of the `module-option` element with the absolute path or the class path (`classpath:/_EXAMPLE_PATH_/kie-git.json`) to this JSON configuration file.


At this point, all users authenticated through the RH-SSO server can clone internal GIT repositories. In the following command, change _USER_NAME_ to a RH-SSO user, for example `admin`:

[source]
----
git clone ssh://USER_NAME@localhost:8001/system
----


ifdef::BA[]
=== Creating and Configuring RH-SSO Client Adapter for BAM

Once you have created a realm client for Business Central and set up the RH-SSO client adapter for EAP, you can repeat the same steps to integrate BAM with RH-SSO. After successful integration of RH-SSO with BAM, you can navigate within Business Central and BAM without having to re-login.

.Procedure: Integrating RH-SSO with BAM
. In the RH-SSO Admin Console, open the security realm that you created.
. Click the *Clients* left menu item and click *Create*.
+
The *Add Client* page opens.

. On the *Add Client* page, provide the required information to create a new BAM client for your realm. For example:
* *Client ID*: dashbuilder
* *Root URL*: http://_localhost_:8080/dashbuilder
* *Client protocol*: openid-connect
+
Once you create a new client, its *Access Type* is set to `public` by default. Change it to `confidential`. 
+
. Configure the RH-SSO client adapter for BAM. To do so, navigate to `_EAP_HOME_/standalone/configuration` in your EAP installation and edit `standalone.xml` to add the RH-SSO subsystem configuration. For example:
+
--
[source,xml]
----
<secure-deployment name="dashbuilder.war">
  <realm>demo</realm>
  <realm-public-key>MIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQKBgQCrVrCuTtArbgaZzL1hvh0xtL5mc7o0NqPVnYXkLvgcwiC3BjLGw1tGEGoJaXDuSaRllobm53JBhjx33UNv+5z/UMG4kytBWxheNVKnL6GgqlNabMaFfPLPCF8kAgKnsi79NMo+n6KnSY8YeUmec/p2vjO2NjsSAVcWEQMVhJ31LwIDAQAB</realm-public-key>
  <auth-server-url>http://localhost:8180/auth</auth-server-url>
  <ssl-required>external</ssl-required>
  <resource>dashbuilder</resource>
  <enable-basic-auth>true</enable-basic-auth>
  <credential name="secret">e92ec68d-6177-4239-be05-28ef2f3460ff</credential>
  <principal-attribute>preferred_username</principal-attribute>
</secure-deployment>
----

Here,

* `secure-deployment name`: The name of the BAM war file being deployed.
* `realm-public-key`: The public key of the realm you created.
* `resource`: The name of the client that you created for BAM (dashbuilder).
* `enable-basic-auth`: The setting to enable basic authentication mechanism, so that the clients can use both token-based and basic authentication approaches to perform the requests.
* `credential name`: The secret key for the client you created for BAM. You can find the key in the *Credentials* tab on the *Clients* page of the RH-SSO Admin Console.
* `principal-attribute`: The login name of the user. If you do not provide this value, your User Id is displayed in the application instead of your user name.
--
+

. Restart the EAP server and open http://localhost:8080/dashbuilder in a web browser to access BAM. Log in to BAM using your RH-SSO admin user credentials.
+
You can now access both the applications (Business Central and BAM) without having to re-login.
endif::BA[]

== {KIE_SERVER} Authentication through RH-SSO


The {PRODUCT} {KIE_SERVER} provides a REST API for third-party clients. You can integrate the {KIE_SERVER} with RH-SSO to delegate the third-party clients identity management to the RH-SSO server.

Once you have created a realm client for Business Central and set up the RH-SSO client adapter for EAP, you can repeat the same steps to integrate the {KIE_SERVER} with RH-SSO.

=== Creating Client for {KIE_SERVER} on RH-SSO

To create a new client on your already created realm on RH-SSO Admin Console:

.Procedure: Creating a Client for the {KIE_SERVER}

. In the RH-SSO Admin Console, open the security realm that you created.
. Click the *Clients* left menu item and click *Create*.
+
The *Add Client* page opens.

. On the *Add Client* page, provide the required information to create a new client for your realm. For example:
* *Client ID*: kie-execution-server
* *Root URL*: http://_localhost_:8080/kie-server
* *Client protocol*: openid-connect

. Click *Save* to save your changes.
+
Once you create a new client, its *Access Type* is set to `public` by default. Change it to `confidential` and click *Save* again.
. Navigate to the *Credentials* tab and copy the secret key. The secret key is necessary to configure the kie-execution-server client in the next section. 


=== Installing and Setting Up {KIE_SERVER} with Client Adapter

To consume the {KIE_SERVER} remote service endpoints, you must first create and assign the `kie-server` role in the RH-SSO Admin Console.

[NOTE]
====
If you deployed the {KIE_SERVER} to a different application server than Business Central, install and configure RH-SSO on your second server as well.
====

.Procedure: Setting Up the {KIE_SERVER}
. Navigate to `_EAP_HOME_/standalone/configuration` in your EAP installation and edit `standalone.xml` to add the RH-SSO subsystem configuration. For example:
+
--
[source,xml]

  </secure-deployment>
</subsystem>

<system-properties>
  <property name="org.kie.server.sync.deploy" value="false"/>
</system-properties>
----

Here,

* `secure-deployment name`: Name of your application WAR file.
* `realm`: Name of the realm that you created for the applications to use.
* `realm-public-key`: The public key of the realm you created. You can find the key in the *Keys* tab in the *Realm settings* page of the realm you created in the RH-SSO Admin Console. If you do not provide a value for this public key, the server retrieves it automatically.
* `auth-server-url`: The URL for the RH-SSO authentication server.
* `resource`: The name for the server client that you created.
* `enable-basic-auth`: The setting to enable basic authentication mechanism, so that the clients can use both token-based and basic authentication approaches to perform the requests.
* `credential name`: The secret key of the server client you created. You can find the key in the *Credentials* tab on the *Clients* page of the RH-SSO Admin Console.
* `principal-attribute`: The login name of the user. If you do not provide this value, your User Id is displayed in the application instead of your user name.
--
+

. Save your configuration changes in `standalone.xml`.
. Use the following command to restart the EAP server and run the {KIE_SERVER}.
+
--
[source]
----
EXEC_SERVER_HOME/bin/standalone.sh -Dorg.kie.server.id=<ID> -Dorg.kie.server.user=<USER> -Dorg.kie.server.pwd=<PWD> -Dorg.kie.server.location=<LOCATION_URL> -Dorg.kie.server.controller=<CONTROLLER_URL> -Dorg.kie.server.controller.user=<CONTROLLER_USER> -Dorg.kie.server.controller.pwd=<CONTOLLER_PASSWORD>
----

Here is an example:

[source]
----
EXEC_SERVER_HOME/bin/standalone.sh -Dorg.kie.server.id=kieserver1 -Dorg.kie.server.user=kieserver -Dorg.kie.server.pwd=password -Dorg.kie.server.location=http://localhost:8080/kie-execution-server/services/rest/server -Dorg.kie.server.controller=http://localhost:8080/business-central/rest/controller -Dorg.kie.server.controller.user=kiecontroller -Dorg.kie.server.controller.pwd=password
----
--
+

. Once the {KIE_SERVER} is running, you can check the server status. In the following command, `kieserver` is a user name with the `kie-server` role and password `password`:
+
[source]
----
curl http://kieserver:password@localhost:8080/kie-execution-server/services/rest/server/
----


Token-based authorization is also supported for communication between Business Central and the {KIE_SERVER}. You can use the complete token as a system property of your application server, instead of the user name and password, for your applications. However, you must ensure that the token does not expire for the period of interaction between the applications, as it is not automatically refreshed. To get the token, see <<_token_based_authentication>>.

For the Business Central to manage the {KIE_SERVER} using the tokens:

* Set the `org.kie.server.token` property.
+
In such case, do not set the `org.kie.server.user` and `org.kie.server.pwd` properties. The Business Central will then use the `Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN` authentication method. 

If you want to use the REST API using the token-based authentication:

* Set the `org.kie.server.controller.token` property.
+
In such case, do not set the `org.kie.server.controller.user` and `org.kie.server.controller.pwd` properties.

[NOTE]
====
As the {KIE_SERVER} is unable to refresh the token, use a high-lifespan token. A token's lifespan must not exceed January 19 2038. Check with your security best practices to see whether this is a suitable solution for your environment.
====

== Third-Party Client Authentication through RH-SSO

To use the different remote services provided by Business Central or by the {KIE_SERVER}, your client, such as curl, wget, web browser, or a custom REST client, must authenticate through the RH-SSO server and have a valid token to perform the requests. To use the remote services, the authenticated user must have assigned the following roles:

* `rest-all`: For using the Business Central remote services.
* `kie-server`: For using the {KIE_SERVER} remote services.

Use the RH-SSO Admin Console to create these roles and assign them to the users that will consume the remote services.

Your client can authenticate through RH-SSO using one of these options:

* Basic authentication, if it is supported by the client.
* Token-based authentication.


=== Basic Authentication

If you have enabled the basic authentication in the RH-SSO client adapter configuration for both Business Central and {KIE_SERVER}, you can avoid the token grant/refresh calls and call the services as shown in the examples below:

* For web based remote repositories endpoint:
+
[source]
----
 curl http://admin:password@localhost:8080/business-central/rest/repositories
----

* For the {KIE_SERVER}: 
+
[source]
----
curl http://admin:password@localhost:8080/kie-execution-server/services/rest/server/
----

[id='_token_based_authentication']
=== Token-Based Authentication

If you want to opt for a more secure option of authentication, you can consume the remote services from both Business Central and {KIE_SERVER} using a granted token provided by RH-SSO.

.Procedure: Obtaining and Using Token for Authorizing Remote Calls
. In the RH-SSO Admin Console, click the *Clients* left menu item and click *Create* to create a new client.
+
The *Add Client* page opens.

. On the *Add Client* page, provide the required information to create a new client for your realm. For example:
* *Client ID*: kie-remote
* *Client protocol*: openid-connect

. Click *Save* to save your changes.

. Change the token settings in *Realm Settings*:
.. In the RH-SSO Admin Console, click the *Realm Settings* left menu item.
.. Click the *Tokens* tab.
.. Change the value for *Access Token Lifespan* to [parameter]``15`` minutes.
+
This gives you enough time to get a token and invoke the service before it expires.

.. Click *Save* to save your changes.

. Once a public client for your remote clients is created, you can now obtain the token by making an HTTP request to the RH-SSO server's token endpoint using:
+
[source]
----
RESULT=`curl --data "grant_type=password&client_id=kie-remote&username=admin&password=password" http://localhost:8180/auth/realms/demo/protocol/openid-connect/token`
----
+
The user used in the command above is an RH-SSO user. For further information, see <<_adding_a_new_user>>.

. To view the token obtained from the RH-SSO server, use the following command:
+
[source]
----
TOKEN=`echo $RESULT | sed 's/.*access_token":"//g' | sed 's/".*//g'`
----

You can now use this token to authorize the remote calls.
For example, if you want to check the internal {PRODUCT} repositories, use the token as shown below:

[source]
----
curl -H "Authorization: bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8080/business-central/rest/repositories
----
