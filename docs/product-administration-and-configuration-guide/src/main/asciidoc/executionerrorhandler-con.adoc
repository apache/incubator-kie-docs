= The ExecutionErrorHandler

The `ExecutionErrorHandler` is the primary mechanism for all process error handling. It is bound to the life cycle of RuntimeEngine; meaning it is created when a new runtime engine is created, and is destroyed when RuntimeEngine is disposed. A single instance of the `ExecutionErrorHandler` is used within a given execution context or transaction. Both `KieSession` and `TaskService` use that instance to inform the error handling about processed nodes/tasks. `ExecutionErrorHandler` is informed about:

* Starting of processing of a given node instance.
* Completion of processing of a given node instance.
* Starting of processing of a given task instance.
* Completion of processing of a given task instance.

This information is mainly used for errors that are of unknown type; that is, errors that do not provide information about the process context. For example, upon commit time, database exceptions do not carry any process information.
