== The ExecutionErrorHandler

The `ExecutionErrorHandler` is the primary mechanism for all process error handling. It is bound to the life cycle of RuntimeEngine; meaning it is created when a new runtime engine is created, and is destroyed when RuntimeEngine is disposed. A single instance of the `ExecutionErrorHandler` is used within a given execution context or transaction. Both `KieSession` and `TaskService` use that instance to inform the error handling about processed nodes/tasks. `ExecutionErrorHandler` is informed about:

* Starting of processing of a given node instance.
* Completion of processing of a given node instance.
* Starting of processing of a given task instance.
* Completion of processing of a given task instance.

This information is mainly used for errors that are of unknown type; that is, errors that do not provide information about the process context. For example, upon commit time, database exceptions do not carry any process information. 


[float]
== Execution Error Storage

`ExecutionErrorStorage` is a pluggable strategy that permits various ways of persisting information about execution errors. Storage is used directly by the handler that gets an instance of the store when it is created (when RuntimeEngine is created). Default storage implementation is based on the database table, which stores every error and includes all of the available information. Some errors may not contain details, as this depends on the type of error and whether or not it is possible to extract specific information.

== Error Types and Filters

Error handling attempts to catch and handle any kind of error, therefore it needs a way to categorize errors. By doing this, it is able to properly extract information from the error and make it pluggable, as some users may require specific types of errors to be thrown and handled in different ways than what is provided by default.

Error categorization and filtering is based on `ExecutionErrorFilters`. This interface is solely responsible for building instances of `ExecutionError`, which are later stored by way of the `ExecutionErrorStorage` strategy. It has following methods:

* `accept`: indicates if given error can be handled by the filter.
* `filter`: where the actual filtering, handling, and so on happens.
* `getPriority`: indicates the priority that is used when calling filters.

As only one filter can process given error, filters use a priority system to avoid having multiple filters returning alternative “views” of the same error. Priority allows more specialized filters to see if the error can be accepted, or otherwise allow another filter to handle it.

`ExecutionErrorFilter` can be provided using the `ServiceLoader` mechanism, which allows the capability of error handling to be easily extended.

{PRODUCT} ships with the following `ExecutionErrorFilters` :

.ExecutionErrorFilters
[cols="60%,20%,20%",options="header"]
|===
|Class name | Type | Priority
|org.jbpm.runtime.manager.impl.error.filters.ProcessExecutionErrorFilter | Process | 100
|org.jbpm.runtime.manager.impl.error.filters.TaskExecutionErrorFilter | Task | 80
|org.jbpm.runtime.manager.impl.error.filters.DBExecutionErrorFilter | DB | 200
|org.jbpm.executor.impl.error.JobExecutionErrorFilter | Job | 100
|===

Filters are given a higher execution order based on the lowest value of the priority. In above table, filters are invoked in following order:

. Task
. Process
. Job
. DB

[id='_sect_auto_acknowledge_errors']
== Auto Acknowledging Execution Errors

When executions errors occur they are unacknowledged by default, and require a manual action to be performed otherwise they are always seen as information that requires attention. In case of larger volumes, manual actions can be time consuming and not suitable in some situations. 

Auto acknowledgment resolves this issue. It is based on scheduled jobs by way of the `jbpm-executor`, with the following three types of jobs available:

* `org.jbpm.executor.commands.error.JobAutoAckErrorCommand`
** Responsible for finding jobs that previously failed but now are either canceled, completed, or rescheduled for another execution. This job only acknowledges execution errors of type `Job`.
* `org.jbpm.executor.commands.error.TaskAutoAckErrorCommand`
** Responsible for auto acknowledgment of user task execution errors for tasks that previously failed but now are in one of the exit states (completed, failed, exited, obsolete). This job only acknowledges execution errors of type `Task`.
* `org.jbpm.executor.commands.error.ProcessAutoAckErrorCommand`
** Responsible for auto acknowledgment of process instances that have errors attached. It acknowledges errors where the process instance is already finished (completed or aborted), or the task that the error originated from is already finished. This is based on `init_activity_id` value. This job acknowledges any type of job that matches the above criteria.

Jobs can be registered on the {KIE_SERVER}. They are reoccurring job types, and run once a day by default unless explicitly set to `SingleRun`.  Configure auto acknowledge jobs for errors in the following way:

. In Business Central, click *Deploy* -> *Jobs*.
. In the top right of the screen, click *New Job*.
. In the *Type* field, add the auto acknowledge job type from the list above.

The following steps are optional, and allow you to configure auto acknowledge jobs to run either once (`SingleRun`), on specific time intervals (`NextRun`), or using the custom name of an entity manager factory to search for jobs to acknowledge (`EmfName`).

. Click on the *Advanced* tab.
. Click the *Add Parameter* button.
. Enter the configuration parameter you want to apply to the job:
.. `SingleRun`: `true` or `false`
.. `NextRun`: time expression, such as 2h, 5d, 1m, and so on.
.. `EmfName`: custom entity manager factory name.

== Cleaning Up the Error List

The `ExecutionErrorInfo` error list table can be cleaned up to remove redundant information. Depending on the life cycle of the process, errors may remain in the list for some time, and there is no direct API with which to clean up the list. Instead, `jbpm-executor` commands can be scheduled to periodically clean up errors. 

The following options can be used as clean up commands, and are restricted to deleting already completed or aborted process instances:

* `DateFormat` 
** Date format for further date related parameters - if not given `yyyy-MM-dd` is used (pattern of `SimpleDateFormat` class).
* `EmfName` 
** Name of the entity manager factory to be used for queries (valid persistence unit name).
* `SingleRun` 
** Indicates if execution should be single run only (`true`|`false`).
* `NextRun` 
** Provides next execution time (valid time expression, for example: 1d, 5h, and so on)
* `OlderThan`
** Indicates what errors should be deleted - older than given date.
* `OlderThanPeriod` 
** Indicated what errors should be deleted older than given time expression (valid time expression e.g. 1d, 5h, and so on)
* `ForProcess`
** Indicates errors to be deleted only for given process definition.
* `ForProcessInstance`
** Indicates errors to be deleted only for given process instance.
* `ForDeployment` 
** Indicates errors to be deleted that are from given deployment ID.
