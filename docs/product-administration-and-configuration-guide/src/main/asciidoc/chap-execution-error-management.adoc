= Execution Error Management

When an execution error occurs, the process stops and rolls back to the most recent stable state (the closest safe point) and continues its execution. If an error of any kind is not handled by the process, the entire transaction rolls back, leaving the process instance in the previous wait state. Any trace of this is only visible in the logs, and usually displayed to the caller who sent the request to the process engine.

Users with process administrator (`process-admin`) or administrator (`admin`) roles are able to access error messages in Business Central. This functionality provides:

* Better traceability.
* Visibility in case of critical processes.
* Reporting and analytics based on error situations.
* External system error handling and compensation.

Configurable error handling is responsible for receiving any technical errors thrown throughout the process engine execution (including task service). Any technical exception includes:

* Anything that extends `java.lang.Throwable`.
* Process level error handling, and any other exceptions not previously handled.

There are several components that make up the error handling mechanism and allow pluggable approach to extend its capabilities.

The process engine entry point for error handling is the `ExecutionErrorManager`. This is integrated with RuntimeManager, which is then responsible for providing it to underlying components - `KieSession` and `TaskService`. From the API point of view, `ExecutionErrorManager` gives access to:

* `ExecutionErrorHandler` - the primary mechanism for error handling.
* `ExecutionErrorStorage` - pluggable storage for execution error information.


[float]
== The ExecutionErrorHandler

The `ExecutionErrorHandler` is the primary mechanism for all process error handling. It is bound to the life cycle of RuntimeEngine; meaning it is created when a new runtime engine is created, and is destroyed when RuntimeEngine is disposed. A single instance of the `ExecutionErrorHandler` is used within a given execution context or transaction. Both `KieSession` and `TaskService` use that instance to inform the error handling about processed nodes/tasks. `ExecutionErrorHandler` is informed about:

* Starting of processing of a given node instance.
* Completion of processing of a given node instance.
* Starting of processing of a given task instance.
* Completion of processing of a given task instance.

This information is mainly used for errors that are of unknown type; that is, errors that do not provide information about the process context. For example, upon commit time, database exceptions do not carry any process information. 


[float]
== Execution Error Storage

`ExecutionErrorStorage` is a pluggable strategy that permits various ways of persisting information about execution errors. Storage is used directly by the handler that gets an instance of the store when it is created (when RuntimeEngine is created). Default storage implementation is based on the database table, which stores every error and includes all of the available information. Some errors may not contain details, as this depends on the type of error and whether or not it is possible to extract specific information.


[[_sect_error_types_and_filters]]
== Error Types and Filters

Error handling attempts to catch and handle any kind of error, therefore it needs a way to categorize errors. By doing this, it is able to properly extract information from the error and make it pluggable, as some users may require specific types of errors to be thrown and handled in different ways than what is provided by default.

Error categorization and filtering is based on `ExecutionErrorFilters`. This interface is solely responsible for building instances of `ExecutionError`, which are later stored by way of the `ExecutionErrorStorage` strategy. It has following methods:

* `accept`: indicates if given error can be handled by the filter.
* `filter`: where the actual filtering, handling, and so on happens.
* `getPriority`: indicates the priority that is used when calling filters.

As only one filter can process given error, filters use a priority system to avoid having multiple filters returning alternative “views” of the same error. Priority allows more specialized filters to see if the error can be accepted, or otherwise allow another filter to handle it.

`ExecutionErrorFilter` can be provided using the `ServiceLoader` mechanism, which allows the capability of error handling to be easily extended.

{PRODUCT} ships with the following `ExecutionErrorFilters` :

.ExecutionErrorFilters
[cols="60%,20%,20%",options="header"]
|===
|Class name | Type | Priority
|org.jbpm.runtime.manager.impl.error.filters.ProcessExecutionErrorFilter | Process | 100
|org.jbpm.runtime.manager.impl.error.filters.TaskExecutionErrorFilter | Task | 80
|org.jbpm.runtime.manager.impl.error.filters.DBExecutionErrorFilter | DB | 200
|org.jbpm.executor.impl.error.JobExecutionErrorFilter | Job | 100
|===

Filters are given a higher execution order based on the lowest value of the priority. In above table, filters are invoked in following order:

. Task
. Process
. Job
. DB

[[_sect_view_process_instance_errors]]
== View Errors in the Process Instances Perspective

In Business Central, there are two perspectives where administrators are made aware of process errors.

* *Process Management* -> *Process Instances*.
* *Process Management* -> *Error Management*.

In the *Process Instances* perspective, the *Errors* column displays the number of errors, if any, for the current process instance. Use the following process to view the error messages (when present):

. In the *Process Instances* perspective, hover over the number shown in the *Errors* column.
. Click *View All* to view the *Error Management* perspective. 

The *Error Management* view shows a list of errors, filtered by the selected process instance ID.


[[_sect_error_management_perspective]]
== Manage Errors Using the Error Management Perspective

By definition, every error that is caught and stored is unacknowledged, meaning that it is to be handled by someone or something (in case of automatic error recovery). The basis of filtering on existing errors is whether or not they have been taken care of. Acknowledgment on each error saves the user who performed the acknowledgment and the time stamp for traceability purposes.

You can access the *Error Management* view at any time.

. Clicking through the *Process Management* -> *Error Management* options in the drop-down menu in Business Central.
. To view or search for errors, click one of the available tabs:
** *New*
** *Acknowledged*
** *All*
** *Search*
. Select an error from the list to open the *Details* panel on the right. This displays information about the process error or errors.
.. Click the *Acknowledge* button to acknowledge and clear the error. The error can still be viewed later in the *Acknowledged* and *All* tabs at the top of the *Error Management* table.
.. Where the error was related to a job, a *Go to job* button is displayed.
+
Click the *Go to job* button to view the associated job information in the *Jobs* perspective. 
+ 
The *Jobs* perspective allows you to restart, reschedule, or retry the corresponding job.

== Advanced Search Filtering of Errors

Users with administrator or process administrator permissions can filter errors using the *Search* tab in the *Execution Errors* perspective.

Access the *Execution Errors* List by clicking *Process Management* -> *Execution Errors*.

.Filtering Errors - Default View
image::ErrorsSearchSmall.png[Filtering Errors]

Execution errors can be filtered on the following attributes:

Process Instance Id:: Filter by process instance ID.
+
Input: `Numeric`

Job Id:: Filter by job ID. The job id is created automatically when the job is created.
+
Input: `Numeric`

Id:: Filter by process instance ID.
+
Input: `Numeric`

Type::
+
Filter by errors by type. Only one status filter can be applied to the search results at a time. Selecting a different status overwrites the current status filter. Removing the status filter displays all processes, regardless of status.
+
In the *Execution Errors* perspective, *All*, *New*, and *Acknowledged* tabs display a list of all errors with these statuses, however the filtering cannot be performed on these tabs. The following filter states are available:
+
** DB
** Task
** Process
** Job

Acknowledged:: Filter errors that have been or have not been acknowledged.

Error Date:: Filtering by the date or time that the error occurred.
+
This filter has the following quick filter options:

** Last Hour
** Today
** Last 24 Hours
** Last 7 Days
** Last 30 Days
** Custom
+
Selecting *Custom* date and time filtering opens a calendar tool for selecting a date and time range.
+

[[_sect_auto_acknowledge_errors]]
== Auto Acknowledging Execution Errors

When executions errors occur they are unacknowledged by default, and require a manual action to be performed otherwise they are always seen as information that requires attention. In case of larger volumes, manual actions can be time consuming and not suitable in some situations. 

Auto acknowledgment resolves this issue. It is based on scheduled jobs by way of the `jbpm-executor`, with the following three types of jobs available:

* `org.jbpm.executor.commands.error.JobAutoAckErrorCommand`
** Responsible for finding jobs that previously failed but now are either canceled, completed, or rescheduled for another execution. This job only acknowledges execution errors of type `Job`.
* `org.jbpm.executor.commands.error.TaskAutoAckErrorCommand`
** Responsible for auto acknowledgment of user task execution errors for tasks that previously failed but now are in one of the exit states (completed, failed, exited, obsolete). This job only acknowledges execution errors of type `Task`.
* `org.jbpm.executor.commands.error.ProcessAutoAckErrorCommand`
** Responsible for auto acknowledgment of process instances that have errors attached. It acknowledges errors where the process instance is already finished (completed or aborted), or the task that the error originated from is already finished. This is based on `init_activity_id` value. This job acknowledges any type of job that matches the above criteria.

Jobs can be registered on the {KIE_SERVER}. They are reoccurring job types, and run once a day by default unless explicitly set to `SingleRun`.  Configure auto acknowledge jobs for errors in the following way:

. In Business Central, click *Deploy* -> *Jobs*.
. In the top right of the screen, click *New Job*.
. In the *Type* field, add the auto acknowledge job type from the list above.
+
image::auto_acknowledge_error_job1.png[]

The following steps are optional, and allow you to configure auto acknowledge jobs to run either once (`SingleRun`), on specific time intervals (`NextRun`), or using the custom name of an entity manager factory to search for jobs to acknowledge (`EmfName`).

. Click on the *Advanced* tab.
. Click the *Add Parameter* button.
. Enter the configuration parameter you want to apply to the job:
.. `SingleRun`: `true` or `false`
.. `NextRun`: time expression, such as 2h, 5d, 1m, and so on.
.. `EmfName`: custom entity manager factory name.

[[_sect_error_list_cleanup]]
== Cleaning Up the Error List

The `ExecutionErrorInfo` error list table can be cleaned up to remove redundant information. Depending on the life cycle of the process, errors may remain in the list for some time, and there is no direct API with which to clean up the list. Instead, `jbpm-executor` commands can be scheduled to periodically clean up errors. 

The following options can be used as clean up commands, and are restricted to deleting already completed or aborted process instances:

* `DateFormat` 
** Date format for further date related parameters - if not given `yyyy-MM-dd` is used (pattern of `SimpleDateFormat` class).
* `EmfName` 
** Name of the entity manager factory to be used for queries (valid persistence unit name).
* `SingleRun` 
** Indicates if execution should be single run only (`true`|`false`).
* `NextRun` 
** Provides next execution time (valid time expression, for example: 1d, 5h, and so on)
* `OlderThan`
** Indicates what errors should be deleted - older than given date.
* `OlderThanPeriod` 
** Indicated what errors should be deleted older than given time expression (valid time expression e.g. 1d, 5h, and so on)
* `ForProcess`
** Indicates errors to be deleted only for given process definition.
* `ForProcessInstance`
** Indicates errors to be deleted only for given process instance.
* `ForDeployment` 
** Indicates errors to be deleted that are from given deployment ID.
