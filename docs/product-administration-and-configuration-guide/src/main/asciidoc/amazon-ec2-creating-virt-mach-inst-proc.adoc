= Creating Virtual Machine Instance on Amazon EC2
Before you install {PRODUCT}, you must create a virtual machine instance on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2).

. In the main menu, click *AMIs* under the *IMAGES* drop-down menu.
. Choose one of the supported AMIs.
+
For example `RHEL-6.7_HVM_GA-JBEAP-6.4.7-20160421-x86_64-1-Access2-GP2 (ami-50bba23a)`.

. Click *Launch.*
+
The *Choose an Instance Type* window opens. An _instance type_ is a custom configuration of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity of your virtual machine instance.

. Choose one of the listed instance types.

Instance type depends on the needs of your application.
KIE Server and Business Central are usually two separated instances in AWS and each of them requires different settings.
However, at least 2 vCPUs (the number of virtual CPUs) and 7.5 GiB of memory is recommended.

It is possible to launch the instance directly from here by clicking *Review and Launch*. If you want to change additional settings, see the following steps.

. Click *Next: Configure Instance Details*.
+
In this step, you can choose a number of launched instances, network (either EC2-Classic or VPC, the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud), or enable detailed monitoring.
If you want to keep the default settings, continue to the next tab.

. Click *Next: Add Storage*.
+
This screen allows you to add more Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes and modify the settings of the root volume. The minimum recommended size of the root volume is `30 GiB`.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Make sure that the set volume size is greater than the size of the used snapshot.

. Click *Next: Tag Instance* and specify the tags for the instance that can help you search and filter the instances later. For example, the key `Name` can indicate a logical name of the instance in the instance list.
. Click *Next: Configure Security Group*.

A _security group_ is a virtual firewall containing a number of firewall rules that control the traffic for your instance. Each instance can have one or more security groups assigned and these groups can be modified at any time.
