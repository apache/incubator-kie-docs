NOTE: Decide whether you want to create a process in a package of a particular project. See <<_creating_package>> for more information.

To create a process:

. In Business Central, click *Authoring* -> *Project Authoring*.
. In Project Explorer, locate the project in which you want to create the process.
. Click *New Item* -> *Business Process* at the top of Project Explorer.
+
The *Create New Business Process* dialog window opens.
. Enter a name and select a package (optional). Click *Ok*.
+
Process Editor with the newly created process opens.

== Importing Process

.Importing Process in BPMN2 or JSON Format in Process Editor
. In Business Central, click *Authoring* -> *Project Authoring*.
. In Project Explorer, locate the project and the respective package into which you want to import the process.
. If you want to merge the process with any other existing process, open the already existing process in Process Editor. If you want to import a process without changing any of the existing processes, create a new process.
. In Process Editor, click the *Import* icon image:5209.png[] and choose the format of the imported process.
+
The *Import* dialog window opens.
+
[NOTE]
====
The available *Migrate jPDL 3.2 to BPMN2* tool is a technical preview feature and therefore is _not_ supported.
====
. Click *Choose File* and locate the process file, or paste the process definition into the available text box. Click *Import*.
. The *Replace existing model?* dialog window opens. To overwrite the opened process with the imported process, click *Yes*. To merge the two processes, click *No*.

When importing processes, Process Editor provides visual support for process elements and therefore requires information about elements' position on the canvas. If the information is not provided, you need to edit the process position on the canvas manually.

.Importing Process into Git Repository
. Clone the repository.
. Add the process BPMN2 file into the `_REPOSITORY_/_PROJECT_/src/main/resources/_PACKAGE_` directory.
. Commit the changes.
. Push the changes.
